The men in jail with you in Mompos ... They say you talked to a man from the C . I . A .
Claudio used to be a teacher . I was a medical aid worker . We met in Guatemala , in an Indian village called Guamaunco . We were married there . Sophia , our daughter was born there . Claudio was kind and loving , and we were happy ... We were there four years when the civil war broke out ... The guerrillas were all around us , but left us alone ... Then they made an attack on the army nearby . The next night , soldiers came to our village . They were led by American ' advisors '... They accused us of helping the rebels . Our women were raped . Our men were tortured . Our homes were burned ... We crawled out into the fields , but they threw grenades , and Sophia ...
... my baby girl was hit by shrapnel ... she bled to death in Claudio ' s arms .
Claudio joined the guerrillas . When that war ended , we moved to the next war , and the next ... Each fight has only deepened his hatred . And poisoned his soul . He ' s unable to love anything anymore ...
Because I know he was a good man , who ' s been consumed by rage because of what he lost ... Just like you .
Not yet .
I tried to stop him .
He ' s gone back .
Yes .
... Washington D . C .
... He had pictures of a building ...
I don ' t know .
It ' s too late . No one can stop him now .
I got down here from New York ...

I can ' t .
We ' re going with you .
The guard is the only one close . When we ' re past him , we can slip into the jungle . Mauro ' s waiting for us there .
He ' s on the right ... No needless killing .
We have to swim .
Your hired soldiers can ' t shoot .
... I ' m okay .
He can ' t hear or speak .
He ' s a war orphan . I adopted him .
I know where we are . There ' s a secret trail nearby that leads toward Mompos .
It ' s just my arm .
I don ' t recognize anything ... I saw only parts of the building ... I ' m sorry .
I think it ' s a public place . He said he wanted the people of America to feel the terror . ' Terror is all they understand .' He said it over and over ...
No ... No ... No ...
I ' m sorry .
No ...
... No ...
