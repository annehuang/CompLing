There are too many crazy people who could hurt her , Manfred . The World Heritage Foundation has done this all over the world .
Perfectly safe .
Noah ! Look ! Daddy ' s got Space - Busters in the car ... and Space - Busters 2 . Awesome !
So what , you ' re a chauffeur now ? What happened to the temp work ?
Of course .
Noah needs to read twenty pages from his book each day ...
... and Lilly has to put these on , before she goes to sleep .
Jackson , they ' ve been really looking forward to this you know . Don ' t let them down .
Manfred is that you ?
Who is ?
What ?
Then where is it ?
What happened to the music ?
You have to see this .
I just talked to him , Dad . He told me the world Heritage Foundation is a sham . Is that true ?
You knew too ? You sleep with me and you didn ' t say anything ?
I can ' t even look at you . Either of you !
A man was killed ! I want the truth Dad . Right now .
Daddy , where are we going ?
Daddy !
He was very nice .
Daddy you said you weren ' t gonna work on your book .
Stop it ! We ' re in public .
Just because I don ' t care for your arrogant humor doesn ' t mean I ' m acting strange . He is the father of my kids .
Some of his stuff is actually ... He ' s published Gordon .
Did you see that ?
Look ! Mrs . Birnbaum , my teacher is on TV ! On the store ' s TV : A heavy - set blonde WOMAN , 45 , speaking to a reporter in front of Gelson ' s .
Yuri bear ... where are you going ?
Oh honey , I ' m so glad you ' re back ... And you too , darling .
I ' m hungry Mummy .
At least it looks like the Mosquitos ate well .
Wanna come in ?
Tell him to bring Caesar ' s raincoat , it ' s in the Range Rover .
The kids have plans today ...
No I ' m not ! Noah has music at 2 and Lil ' has Karate .
You ' re crazy ! The Governor just said we ' re fine now .
Mommy , why are you so angry with Daddy ?
Because your daddy is a lunatic , darling .
I think we ' re safer here !
Gordon , you know how to fly .
Jackson , what are you doing ?
I ' m fine . How did you know this was gonna happen ?
You ' re sure about this ?
Daddy wait ! I wanna come with you !
Lilly ! Come back !
Let ' s go back , Daddy .
Where are you , honey !?
We ' re looking for a secret map , mommy .
Let me speak to your daddy , darling .
Daddy can ' t talk right now , he ' s driving really fast ...
Ouch !
LILLY ! In the background Kate hears the voice of Charlie Frost .
Who ' s in the car with you ? Who ' s that man screaming ?
He ' s not in the car . He ' s on a mountain waiting for fireworks . 47 . Lilly spots Charlie way up on a ridge . He has erected his ten foot radio antenna with the flag fluttering on top .
There he is ! Up there !
Bring back my child , Jackson ! NOW !
Okay ...
Jackson , things are really looking bad here !
It ' s following us !
Mommy !
Where ' s daddy ?!
Gordon ! Wait !
JACKSON ! NO ! Noah begins to cry and Lilly clings to her mom . Gordon just stares , paralyzed .
It ' s daddy !
Jackson ! Here !
So , now that you got your map , where are we going ?
Gordon ' s right . Look at this mess .
Where is my father ?
We have to go back !
Let me get out . Mr . Anheuser - tell the Captain .
Gordon is a pilot .
Be careful , Noh '!
How did you meet Dr . Silberman ? He ' s great , isn ' t he ?
I think for the same reasons you did . You know , after breast feeding two kids ...
Did your husband ask you to get your ' s done ?
We are not married . And we probably never will ... But he paid for them .
I bet he did .
What did the man pay for mommy ?
Nothing , Lil ' bee .
What ' s your situation ?
Way too complicated ...
I ' ve got nothing to say to you .
I ' m a big girl Adrian . I don ' t need protection . You used me . You guys had me gallivanting around the world , as part of your little cover - up .
Sure , if your name ' s Da Vinci or Picasso . But if you ' re some young talent in Podunk , Texas , sorry you ' re not famous enough . People like you and Anheuser and my father - you think you can play God .
That ' s bullshit and you know it . It ' s the fittest , the richest and the strongest that survive .
Zero . What ' s your point ?
I need to know that too , Adrian .
Anything ?
I can ' t think about what ' s going on down there .
I wanted to thank you . For coming back for us .
Do you think people change ?
Do you think you ' ve changed since we separated ?
You know , you always had tunnel vision . You could always just block things out and write . You blocked all of us out Jackson .
I love him enough .
Is it time ?
Wake up Lil ' bee . We ' re getting ready to land .
Yuri bear , what are we doing ?
Where ' s Sasha ?
Daaadddy !
We ' re all fine .
It ' s a joke ... a mistake ... Right Yuri ?
I should have listened to you , Dr . Silberman . I actually liked the way I looked before that monster talked me into it .
Cheap bastard .
Now that he ' s gone I think he was worth a hundred times a man like Yuri .
Captain Michaels ? What happens to all those people ?
I have no clue if you understand what I ' m saying , but I ask you as a mother , please take my kids with you !
Thank you ma ' am . Thank you so much .
Where can I find Adrian Helmsley ?
Oh my god , that ' s Yuri !
Caesar darling !
Come to mommy !
What in god ' s name is happening Adrian ?
If my father were here , he would open the gates .
Phew ... It stinks in here .
Sssh ... Caesar .
No !
That guy is injured . Something must have gone wrong .
What now ?
Tamara ! Take Lilly and Noah .
I was so worried about you .
Mummy !
Lilly run !
We need something to stop the bleeding or he ' ll die .
Lilly !
I ' m alright Mom !
Noah !
Noah ! Where is he ?
Whatever you do ... I will never let you go again .
How many copies did you say that sold ?
It seems we have very different tastes Mr . Helmsley ?
Actually my diary ' s pretty open .
Daddy ? When can we go back home ?
I ' m not Daddy . No more pull - ups .
Of course you can . He ' s your doggie .
What ' s that ?
Really ? You may well be the first person who ever got to the end .
