You said you wasn ' t coming home until tomorrow .
Just let him out . He didn ' t know ...
What the fuck is wrong with you ! What ' d you expect ? You drag me out here then run off with your damn brother every weekend !
You think you ' re a cowboy cause you rodeo ? You ' re no cowboy . You ' re just a lousy ranch - hand and a shitty fuckin lay !
Will a drink make you 6 inches taller and charming ? Will it make you not married ?
I watched you take your ring off . Don ' t be a scumbag . Go home .
Yeah ? What kind of pants does a girl have to wear to be left alone ?
Is that how it is with you guys -- suddenly single after three beers ?
That ' s great . A real red - neck .
What ' s the difference ?
What do you do for work ? You look like military .
Do I look stupid to you ?
Not until you tell me what you do .
You ' re obviously military . What branch ?
Are you kidding me ? You ' re a SEAL ?
I know all about you guys . My sister was engaged to a SEAL .
You ' re a bunch of arrogant , self - centered pricks who think you can lie and do whatever the fuck you want . I ' d never date a SEAL .
Why ?
Where are you going ?
I said I ' d never marry one .
Taya .
Pretty egotistical of you to think you can protect us all , isn ' t it Chris ?
Sounds like you ' re under attack .
-- I ' m not going home with you so don ' t even think about it .
You figured what ?
Did you always want to be a soldier ?
So you started rescuing girls from bars ?
Only when I ' m depressed .
Someday . My mom says I have a nose for picking the wrong men .
I ' ve proven her right .
What happens when there ' s a real person on the other end of that gun ?
I know . I don ' t ...
I want to . I do ...
You hardly even know me .
Nothing . Everything . I don ' t know . What if it doesn ' t work out ?
You got it all planned out , don ' t you .
Well ... you ' re gonna need a ring if you want to talk all tough like that .
Oh my god ! No ! Chris --
What the hell is on your neck ?
What do you --
I ' m so afraid .
Your heart is beating out of your chest .
Have you killed anyone yet ?
Don ' t be weird with me . Seriously . I want you to tell me everything .
You knocked me up and now I ' m stuck here by myself assembling baby - cribs and you can ' t talk to me ? That ' s the big plan ?
You guys almost done over there yet ?
It ' s called a nightgown .
And three days is not a honeymoon .
You want me to talk dirty to you ?
Well , you ' ll just have to decide what ' s more important .
Fat and horny . It ' s kinda disgusting .
- So romantic .
Nobody said it ' s a boy --
How do you know ?
I hope you ' re right .
Did your dad get hold of you ?
Shit . You need to call him . Hang up and --
I ' m so selfish . I wasn ' t even thinking --
Your little brother deployed .
He didn ' t get in . Just call your dad --
Over there . He ' s headed to Iraq .
You were right , doctor says it ' s a boy .
Chris !--
Chris --
I thought you were dead . I thought --
I have an alien growing inside me --
And there ' s a strange man in my bedroom .
Why isn ' t it on your finger ?
Your hands feel different .
Why am I so fucking nervous ?
No you ' re not . Don ' t lie .
Why are you so good with me .
What do you want to do today , hon '?
Okay , we do that . Let ' s relax .
I ' m done being pregnant . I want to meet him .
Well , this is the first time we left the house .
Jesus Christ Chris ...
What am I supposed to do . You ' re not talking . You act like it ' s all okay --
You ' re not fine . Your blood pressure --
Chris --
-- it ' s happening --
What ' re you doing !
-- oh my god , you ' re crazy ! You ' re fucking crazy you know that ?
Don ' t bother turning it off , I already watched it .
I had to make sure you didn ' t have an Iraqi girlfriend sending sexy videos .
That day we were on the phone --
You ' re not protecting me by not talking about it .
My imagination is so much worse than anything you could tell me --
Chris --
It ' s not about them , it ' s about us . You have to make it back to us .
I ' m making memories by myself . I have no one to share them with .
When does that start ? Even when you ' re here you ' re not here .
I hate the teams for it . I do . You ' re my husband and the father of my children -- but they ' re the ones that pull you back .
You can only circle the flame so long .
Marc wrote that letter two weeks ago . Did he say any of that to you ?
Chris ? I want to know what you thought of his letter ...
Do you want to die ? Is that what it is ?
Then tell me why do you do it . I want to understand .
No you don ' t . I ' m here . Your family is here . Your children have no father --
Bullshit . It ' s not about us anymore . You don ' t know when to quit . It ' s over - You did your part ! We sacrificed enough . Let somebody else go --
You find a way ! You have to . I need you to be human again . I need you here . If you leave again , we might not be here when you get back .
Hello ?
Hello ?
Chris -- What ' s the noise ?
I can ' t hear you --
What ' s happening --
Chris --
Where are you ? I got a weird message that you were on a plane ?
So are you in Germany , or --
You ' re home ? What are you doing ?
Chris , the kids are dying to see you . It ' s been nine months .
Are you alright ?
Then come home . We miss you .
Chris ...?
-- his game is Saturdays . He ' s the tallest kid on the team . The doctor said he could be six - four . I can ' t wait for you to see him play . Maybe you could even coach ?
McKenna ' s about to lose that tooth and I ' m worried she ' s going to swallow it . She said she ' d let you pull it . But only you .
Can I tell you something .
I ' m proud of you and I don ' t say it enough . I feel blessed . You ' re an incredible father and -- I feel lucky to have my husband back .
I know how hard you fought to get here .
Did you pleat those jeans ?
Well , you ' re just a regular old cowboy again , aren ' t you ?
Aren ' t you and Chad going to the range ?
Is that all it takes .
Who are you taking out ?
Well don ' t be late for dinner .
Love you too .
