Cat ! Is your homework finished yet ?
Working on it Mama .
You draw beautifully my love , but if you want to be something in life you have to study .
I am studying Mama . I want to be a super hero .
Better to be a doctor . A lawyer .
Are we going to see Uncle Emilio ? 2 . I don ' t know . Just waiting to hear from your father .
Fabio ?
Cataleya , go pack !
I ' m packed Mama .
I don ' t understand papa .
I ' m ready .
I love you too Papa .
To kill Don Luis !
My Papa . 21 . AMERICAN 1 And where is your Papa ?
Dead .
Yes ... my passport .
To provide a safe , healthy nurturing environment where young women can get the education they will need to meet the challenges of that amazing adventure called life . How does that sound to you , my dear ?
Which we keep right here ...
And give you twenty a week for incidentals .
What do we say darling ?
Where do I sleep ?
Very tired .
I do .
But it ' s gonna cost you . Twenty dollars .
Twenty dollars a week .
How much ?
Cataleya .
Uncle Emilio ?
Buenos diaz Cara . Come . Sit . I ' ll make you some eggs .
You have your mother ' s beautiful eyes . Don ' t be scared . This is your home .
I don ' t know . A long time ago .
Whose room is that ?
Where is he ? 32 . EMILIO He ' s dead .
Killed ?
By who ?
I used to want to be like Lara . A super agent .
I want to be a killer .
Can you help ?
Are you trying to scare me ?
I ' ve already been to school . I told you what I want to be . You don ' t want to help me , fine . I ' ll do it myself .
But I still want to be a killer .
Is that it ?
Wearing no panties ? 38 . The Sergeant and the arresting cops holding her up give her a long look , as do any of the other cops in ear shot , whose eyes go to her very short skirt .
Thank goodness .
Unbutton your shirt .
Now . 44 . Rizzo looks over to where the Marshal is passed out cold on the floor . He does as he is told .
Not room service .
I shouldn ' t drink . 49 . SERGEANT No you shouldn ' t .
I ' m so so sorry .
What ' s going on out there ?
Really ?
I probably deserve it .
I would have never forgiven myself .
We ' re good .
Day after .
The morning after OK ?
Say hello to Mama .
Hello Danny .
Why ?
I have a key .
I ' ve got nowhere to go .
Just what ?
And then we have the most incredible sex . Ever .
Uh - uh . This taste good enough .
No . They put me to sleep .
Would you like the key back ?
Closer ?
Is this close enough ?
On my end . You ?
What do we have ?
Not long .
No reason .
I ' ve got to get ready .
Tio . You ' re removed . You book the work , you collect the fees ...
I come to you at nine . I say I want to be a killer . What kind of kid makes a career choice like that unless they have something on their mind . I live for the day that the blood of the son of bitch who did my parents drips in the gutter . Stop playing the innocent with me . You know this . Forever .
Why ?
If you do , you would never have let me get involved in the first place .
I love you too .
Hi guys .
Hey ! Hey !
OK . OK . Now sit . 65 . The dogs obey her in a heartbeat , sitting expectantly . Not making a sound .
Now let ' s see what good boys you can be .
Top cut sirloin .
Nice , huh ?
Red , juicy , delicious .
Stay .
Good boys . Eat .
Hola Pepe . I guess the boys gave me away .
I train them .
Of course .
And the salsa Verde .
The long one .
Of course .
As always .
Not this year .
I should do a lot of things .
Maybe next year .
Rewarding .
Your ears are better than my eyes .
Good idea .
Willie you are such a perv .
Always !
Here fishy fishy !
Willie ! They ' re ignoring me !
Stop right there .
Doesn ' t matter who I am .
I want you exactly where you are .
You know the thing about sharks . You can swim with them all day and they will just ignore you , but put one drop of blood in the water and they become your biggest admirers .
I ' m not going to kill you . They are . 73 . She fires three shots into the glass square he is kneeling on . The glass shatters . William falls into the water . Grabs onto the squares on either side and props himself up . His blood runs down into the clear water . Cat turns and walks toward the door .
I brought you something .
You ' re making fun .
Well , there ' s that too .
You don ' t want me ?
What would you like to talk about ?
You really want to do this ?
OK . She stands there , waiting .
Nothing much .
On vacation .
Down south .
There was that one .
It was OK .
Nothing much . A little swimming , fed the fish .
Now me what ?
OK . Want to fuck ?
Like what ?
That ' s a hard one for me .
I ' m lonely sometimes .
Isn ' t that enough ?
I shouldn ' t have done this .
Any of it .
Because .
We already talked . I ' m late .
I don ' t like eggs .
Now you know something else about me .
Don ' t come out . Please . Don ' t .
Sorry I ' m late .
So what ?
Tio . Could be anyone . You ' re seeing things that aren ' t there .
How many people did you kill in revenge for your boy ' s death ? How many ? And you ' re going to give me a lecture about revenge ?
Cara . You will come home for lunch .
No Mama . One thing at a time .
That was such a nice surprise .
I think she ' s going to be OK .
It ' s me . 90 . Danny ' s heart goes to his throat .
Are you busy ?
I was just sitting here , looking out the window . And I thought ... where are you ?
So we ' re seeing the same sky .
And I ' m happy to hear yours .
... What picture ?
What picture Danny ???
Who else saw the picture ?
Who else ? 92 . DANNY His sister . I didn ' t want to .. it ' s just ... I wanted to contact you . I wanted to ...
What does the sister of Ryan have to do with this ?
Closer . I know . Goodbye Danny .
I ' m sorry ... I ' m sorry ... I ' m sorry 98 . INT . FBI OFFICE - DAY An operator answers .
I ' d like to speak to the agent in charge of the TAG killings .
This won ' t take long . Hands up .
Turn around .
Sit .
You mean these ?
Talking about covering all your bases . Your chair is pressure wired . You move your ass one inch you don ' t have one anymore .
I know what you ' re thinking . Maybe yes a bluff , maybe no . But you have to figure yes , given what you know about me .
This wasn ' t what I had in mind for myself when I was a kid . I wanted to be on the other side of things . Like you .
He did .
This is the last time I was happy . 100 . The next day they were dead . He killed them .
I didn ' t know how else to find him .
It took you a long time .
What else do I have to be ? I have no one . I did . Until this morning . I had them .
And now I want to finish it .
Yes you can . He ' s protected by your government .
You ' re going to have to try harder .
I found this on your table inside . Your family , right ?
Brothers , sisters , nieces , nephews . Mother , father . Nice .
I know this sounds harsh . But until I get what I want , you ' ll go to a funeral a week . And you will begin to feel what I have felt all these years .
When your dinner ' s ready , the timer on it will have expired . Then you can get to work .
You guys ever been to New Orleans ?
Good morning . 105 . Sitting , with two cups of coffee , and pastries .
I didn ' t know if you took sugar and cream , so I got one of each .
You designed the house at eight seven six Magnolia .
I would love to see the plans of this house .
Yes , it is .
It ' s Cataleya .
For something you can never understand . The love I had for my parents . And you killed that .
Actually Don Luis ... you are exactly where I want you to be .
EAT ! EXT . ARMORED VAN - DAY Over the sounds of the dogs tearing Don Luis to pieces and his horrible screams , the van shakes as if it were caught in an earthquake .
Hello Danny .
I ' m fine .
Where are you ?
That I would come over and we would have amazing sex . Your phone is tapped , you know that ?
You have forty seconds before they pick up on this . Gives you the time for three questions . 116 . DANNY OK ... What ' s your real name ?
... Cataleya .
Twenty seconds .
I know where to find you .
Last question .
