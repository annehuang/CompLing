As you wish to tell me, I doubt I have any choice in the matter...
Bow can it affect them?
Oh, so that is his design in settling here? Mr Bennet takes a book from his table and walks out of the library into the corridor where the girls are gathered, Mrs Bennet following.
There is no need, for I already have. The piano stops. A frozen silence. They all stare.
You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for them; they are my constant companions these twenty years.
I will give my hearty consent to his marrying whichever of the girls he chooses.
I believe so. Lydia and Kitty shriek with excitement.
And what do you say, Mary? Are you not excited by the prospect of a ball?
I find it very charming.
Delighted to make your acquaintance.
Very much.
Yes, it fills me with guilt. He looks at Jane a little blush starts around his collar.
Not a good reader, you see. I like being out of doors. I mean, I can read, of
Thank you. It is the work of many generations.
That's exactly what I meant. He beams at Jane.
May I have the honour? They leave, to dance.
Not if I can help it. Elizabeth, Darcy and Miss Bingley stand in silence as they over hear the following...
I have long suspected that we have two of the silliest girls in the county.
Come Darcy, I must have you dance. I hate to see you standing by yourself in this stupid manner.
Upon my word, I've never seen so many pretty girls in my life.
You are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room.
Oh, she is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld, but her sister Elizabeth is very agreeable. They have stopped at the edge of the dance floor and have not seen Elizabeth and charlotte who are standing close behind them. Elizabeth smirks as she overhears their conversation.
Perfectly tolerable, I dare say, but not handsome enough to tempt me. Elizabeth's smile drops.
 Your friend Miss Lucas is a most amusing young woman.
I thought that poetry was the food of love.
So what do you recommend, to encourage affection?
â€¢ If he'd had any compassion for me he would have sprained his ankle in the first dance.
 Kitty, be so kind as to pass the butter.
Good grief, woman. Your skills in the art of match-making are without question.
Well, my dear, if your daughter does die it will be a comfort to know it was all in pursuit of Mr Bingley.
Why the devil not. We could have them all laid up at Netherfield Hall.
 She's upstairs.
I think her concern for her sister does her credit. A little pause, Caroline recovers.
Miss Elizabeth! Oh I'm so glad to see you A doctor comes out of Jane's room.
It is a pleasure, I mean not to see her so sick, of course, that's terrible. I will have a room made up for you. You must be our guest here until Jane recovers.
I thought she showed remarkable spirit coming all this way.
If they had uncles enough to fill all Cheapside it would not make them one jot less agreeable.
Who, my sweetest?
It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of yours.
I have already told her once, by your desire. Lizzie looks across from her book.
 Â€¢ Perhaps you will give me leave to defer your raptures till I write again. At present I have not enough room to do them justice. Mr Bingley now pacing anxiously around the room.
Its amazing, how young ladies have the patience to be so accomplished.
They all paint tables, and embroider cushions and play the piano. I never heard of a young lady, but people say she is accomplished.
The word is indeed applied too liberally. I cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen women, in all my acquaintance, that are truely accomplished.
I do.
And of course she must improve her mind by extensive reading. Elizabeth closes her book.
Are you so severe on your own sex?
You can only have two motives, Miss Bingley, and I would interfere with either.
Either you are in each other's confidence and have secret affairs to discuss, or you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage by walking. If the first, I should get in your way. If the second, I can admire you â€¢ much better from here.
That I couldn't say.
Maybe it's that I find it hard to forgive the follies and vices of others, or their offences against myself. My good opinion, once lost, is lost forever.
Absolutely I find the country very diverting. Don't you agree, Darcy?
I find it perfectly adequate even if society is a little less varied than in town.
Well...
When your sister has recovered you shall name the day.
Please let me show you to Jane, you will find her quite recovered.
Really, you're welcome anytime you feel the least bit poorly.
Miss Bennet. They share a look as Elizabeth joins the rest of the Bennets in the carriage. The driver takes off. Bingley waves enthusiastically to Jane.
Goodbye. Goodbye.
I hope, my dear, that you have ordered a good dinner today, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family
We have some more somewhere.
 How happy for you, Mr Collins, to possess the talent for flattering with delicacy. Mr Collins nods with satisfaction.
I was on my way to your house.
I was just waiting until your sister was quite well.-
 Â€¢ As soon as they have made the white soup.
Will you excuse me ladies? Mr Wickham. Enjoy the day. Elizabeth looks at Wickham, puzzled.
You're here! I'm so pleased.
How are you, Miss Elizabeth? Elizabeth is not paying attention, instead she is searching over Mr Bingleys' shoulder for a sight of Wickham.
Are you, looking for someone?
May I have the next dance, Miss Elizabeth. Elizabeth is stunned.
Indeed. Most invigorating. They continue, for a moment, in silence.
I am perfectly happy to oblige, please advise me of what you would like most to â€¢ hear.
Do you talk as a rule while dancing?
I see no striking resemblance of your own character in this, how near it is to mine your sisters very often walk to Meryton?
I will admit your Mr Wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friends - whether he is capable of retaining them is less certain.
I am. May I ask to what these questions tend.
And what have you discovered?
I hope to afford you more clarity in the â€¢ future.
Mary dear, you've delighted us long enough.
Let the other young ladies have a turn.
And what am I to do? Mrs Bennet drags Mr Bennet to his feet.
 So, your mother insists on you marrying Mr Collins.-
Well, Lizzie. From this day on you must be a stranger to one of your parents -
Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr Collins, and I will never see you again if you do.
Poor Jane. However, a girl likes to be crossed in love now and then. It gives her something to think of, and a sort of distinction among her companions.
It's your turn now, Lizzie. Since you've turned down Mr Collins you're free to go off and be jilted yourself. What about Mr Wickham? He is a pleasant fellow and would do the job credibly.
 Miss Bennet...I'm staying here.
She plays very well.
I am well enough acquainted with you, Miss Bennet, to know I cannot alarm you even should I wish it. A beat. They eye each other warily. Colonel Fitzwilliam joins them.
 I knew nobody beyond my own party.
I do not have the talent of conversing easily with people I have never met before.
This is a charming house. I believe my aunt did a great deal to it when Mr Collins first arrived.
Mr Collins seems very fortunate in his choice of wife.
No. Thankyou. The sound of the front door, and voices. Darcy jumps up.
Good day, Miss Bennet. It's been a pleasure. He bows to her and leaves. Elizabeth sits there, bemused and intrigued.
Miss Bennet, I have struggled in vain but I can bear it no longer ... . The past months have been a torment... He pauses, unable to speak. Elizabeth stares at him in astonishment. He struggles on.
I came to Rosings with the single object of seeing you...I had to see you...
â€¢ I've fought against my better judgement, my family's expectation...
 I love you. Most ardently. Elizabeth stares at him.
Please do me the honour of accepting my hand. A silence. Elizabeth struggles with the most painful confusion of feeling. Finally she recovers.
 Is this your reply?
Are you laughing at me?
Are you rejecting me?
Might I ask why, with so little endeavour at civility, I am thus repulsed?
Believe me, I didn't mean -
What reasons?
I do not deny it.
Because I believed your sister indifferent to him.
â€¢ I watched them most carefully, and realized his attachment was much deeper than hers.
Bingley too is modest, and was persuaded that she didn't feel strongly for him.
I did it for his own good.
 No! I wouldn't do your sister the
It was made perfectly clear that-an advantageous marriage...
There was, however, I have to admit... the matter of your family -
No, it was more than that.
It pains me to say this, but it was the lack of propriety shown by your mother, your three younger sisters - even, on occasion, your father. Forgive me. Lizzie blushes. He has hit home. Darcy paces up and down.
You and your sister -- I must exclude from this... Darcy stops and gazes at her. He is in turmoil. Elizabeth glares at him, in a blaze of fury and misery.
Mr Wickham?
You take an eager interest in that gentleman's concerns!
Oh yes, his misfortunes have been very great indeed!
So this is your opinion of me! Thank you for explaining so fully. Perhaps these offences might have been overlooked, if your pride had not been hurt -
- by my honesty in admitting scruples about our relationship.
Forgive me, madam, for taking up so much of your time. He leaves, abruptly. Elizabeth watches him stride away, through the rain. What has she done? She bitterly bursts into tears.
I came to leave you this. He places a letter on the table behind her. Elizabeth does not turn but watches him through the mirror.
Lydia will never be easy till she has exposed herself in some public place or other, and we can never expect her to do it with so little inconvenience as under the present circumstances.
Colonel Forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief, and she is far too poor to be an object of prey to anyone.
I'm sure the officers will find women better worth their while. Let us hope, in fact, that her stay in Brighton will teach her her own insignificance. At any rate she can hardly grow any worse, without authorizing us to lock her up for the rest of her life. Elizabeth gazes at her father - will nothing touch him? He gave up on his daughter long ago. For this, just now, she hates him.
Well, at least the house will be quieter.
Miss Bennet! Elizabeth stops, appallingly embarrassed. Darcy catches up with her. They both blush, deeply.
 No... I'm not.
And are you having a pleasant trip?
â€¢ Tomorrow?
May I see you to the village?
Yes.
- I shall send my carriage at noon After a moment Darcy leaves and Elizabeth approaches the table.
My sister, Miss Darcy... They smile and bob. Georgiana is a friendly, sweet girl.
â€¢ Yes I should.
She's easily persuaded, is she not? They gaze at each other with affection. Miss Bingley approaches.
Your uncle is fond of fishing, I hear.
Can you persuade him to borrow a rod this afternoon?
I perceive no alteration' except she is rather tanned. Hardly a miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer.
You must have mis-heard, Caroline. Even had I thought it, I would have couched it
Miss Elizabeth. She cries on.
This is my fault - if only I had exposed Wickham when I should.
Would to heaven that anything could be said or done on my part that could offer consolation to such distress.
I am so very sorry. This is grave indeed. I will leave you. Goodbye. Darcy pauses at the door, looks back at Elizabeth and then is gone.
Excuse me. They ignore him. He tries again
his throat) I am looking for a Mr â€¢ Wickham.
For God's sake let me be!
 Where else could they be so well concealed?
â€¢ It's been my own doing.
No Lizzie. Let me once in my life feel how much I have been to blame.
As it is addressed to me... He tears it open and begins to read, squinting because he has forgotten his glasses.
Just wait. I can't make out his script.
Of course I will agree. But how much your uncle has laid on this wretched man already is anybody's guess.
No man in his senses would marry Lydia on so slight a temptation as a hundred a year.
Your uncle is very generous.
Wickham's a fool if he takes her for less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to think so ill of him in the very - beginning of our relationship.
Before you take any of these houses, Mrs Bennet, let us be clear. Into one house she will never be welcome. Mrs Bennet stares at him.
That is out. of the question.
I have some business with Mr Bingley. Darcy goes inside and the door shuts. The camera cranes slowly upstairs until we can see through the first floor window and into the drawing room. Mr Darcy enters and bows to Mr Bingley. He starts to talk in earnest. Bingley looks stunned by what Darcy is relaying to him. We witness the dumbshow of Darcy confessing that he has wronged Jane Bennet.
 I did hear of it, and offer my congratulations.
Just a few weeks. For the shooting.
Thank you -
 Â€¢ Excellent.
Quite well, thank you.
I return to town tomorrow.
She does indeed. Well, I must be going, I suppose. Darcy - Darcy cannot quite believe it. He gives Bingley a harsh stare, Bingley has not completed his task.
Oh damn, damn, buggery, damn.
What were you thinking of? It's as if Bingley has not heard. He keeps pacing up and down.
Damn and blast, oh buggery, damn.
I, erm, I know this is all very embarrassing, but I would like to request the privilege of speaking to Miss Jane - They all look at him.
Miss Bennet, you have been the victim of a huge misunderstanding. Suffice to say, I have been an unmitigated and comprehensive ass. And therefore, I would like to ask you -
I am sure they will do well together,
 Could I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps?
Lizzie, what on earth is going on?
What are you doing out here so early?
Me neither. I have been up.most of the night.
I am alarmed that you know of what I have been so in earnest to keep silent. But you must know that your happiness was one of my prime inducements. Elizabeth looks at Darcy.
Lizzie, are you out of your senses? I thought you hated the man.
He is rich, to be sure, and you will have more fine carriages than Jane. But will that make you happy?
None at all. We all know him to be a proud, unpleasant sort of fellow, but this would be nothing if you really liked him.
What has he done?
Good Lord. I must pay him back.
You do love him, don't you? Elizabeth nods.
I cannot believe that anyone can deserve you, but it seems I am over-ruled. So I heartily give my consent. Elizabeth jumps up and puts her arms around him.
I could not have parted with you, my Lizzie, to any one less worthy.
And if any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am quite at â€¢ leisure.
Allow me, Mrs Darcy. He puts out his hand. She takes it. He helps her up the rocks. When they get to the top they sit there, side by side, and gaze at the distant lights of Pemberley.
I cannot fix the hour, or the spot, or
For the liveliness of your mind, I did.
