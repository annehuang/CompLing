Let's just see what happens, okay?
0.270647830496
0.729352169504
How did you know?
0.241438970198
0.758561029802
What makes you think I would do that?
0.41526336467
0.58473663533
Is what the money thing?
0.431044524023
0.568955475977
How am I gonna do that?
0.218119329267
0.781880670733
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM?
0.420906147326
0.579093852674
Is that the last thing you need?
0.476145552296
0.523854447704
Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
0.404236633794

Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
0.396371634109
0.603628365891
What?
0.345535507929
0.654464492071
Were you with him last night?

How did you do that?
0.167262731761
0.832737268239
Then... why are you here so often?

0.341163785258
Are you ready for another?
0.461993648953

Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
0.400229025936
0.599770974064
Do you think I'm an imbecile?
0.63668461572
0.36331538428
You want to work at Carl's?
0.26652132903

You don't think they'll call it off...?
0.140018849067
0.859981150933
You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
0.239536137201
0.760463862799
And don't tell my sisters anything?
0.139780445947

How many could you handle?
0.543888309838
0.456111690162
Why did he try to kill me?
0.129843500209
0.870156499791
Did you fix the damn film?
0.436698465275
0.563301534725
Will that do?
0.290020889542
0.709979110458
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
0.206933469315
0.793066530685
So you're going to kill her?
0.235079379722
0.764920620278
What do you think?
0.47672436743
0.52327563257
You got a little girl?
0.263943652675
0.736056347325
How did you know I was here?
0.233188726812
0.766811273188
Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
0.601219185012
0.398780814988
Would you mind repeating the question?
0.539900631556
0.460099368444
But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right?
0.260163925002
0.739836074998
You have a problem with that?
0.229845483405
0.770154516595

Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
0.493054729455
0.506945270545
So what do you think, is it -- -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
0.861281418846
0.138718581154
But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
0.67616501048
0.32383498952
Has it got a wow finish?
0.340477982886
0.659522017114
Are you going to deny it?
0.366322691404
0.633677308596
What do you feel like doing?
0.39163425931
0.60836574069
How do you like that?
0.347792134677
0.652207865323
But if you could, you would?
0.60268462244
0.39731537756
How's everything?
0.224020221051
0.775979778949
Didn't everybody?
0.214340633809
0.785659366191
What will be okay?
0.441567878123
0.558432121877
Why are you doing this?
0.186777850204
0.813222149796
What's a scam?
0.286981926355
0.713018073645
So what's that mean?
0.216024572627
0.783975427373
That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
0.452279646408
0.547720353592
What?
0.345535507929
0.654464492071

What did she do?
0.279186749798
0.720813250202
Not your regular street muck, is it?
0.378636580772
0.621363419228
How much would it cost me?
0.291007578586
0.708992421414
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
0.258238978692
