Give me your gun and radio.
My argument is not with you.
She's dead. She was killed.
I didn't believe that.
She was shot. A man came for me.
Someone started all this...and I'm going to find them.
Who started Treadstone?
Just tell me what I want to know!
You know something. Tell me where to start looking.
They give me the name I want, or I burn their entire house down to get it.
Take the footbridge. Go to the West Entrance. I'll meet you at the newsstand.
Why do you know so much about me?
The article. You talked to someone from Treadstone. Someone there at the beginning. What's his name?
Whoever they are it's trouble.
Blackbriar, what's Blackbriar?
What? What are you talking about?

INSIDE!  BOURNE searching the concourse. Something bothering him. The threat level clicking another notch.
Service doorway -- Now!  27 
Keep moving.
I'm going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say.
No, listen to me: Exactly what I say this time. Understand?
Stay here while I look for an escape.
No, stay behind that door.
Don't move until I tell you.
No, No not now.
What are you doing here?
Where's Daniels?
How long do I have?
Okay, where is Daniels headed?
Okay, Tangier is about 300 miles away, we can make the morning ferry.
Do you know who this is?
I have to get back to the beginning...or I'll never be free of this.
I think he started Treadstone. I remember meeting him. I remember the first day... Daniels brought me to him.
An initiation...I guess...
Why are you helping me?
No.
Now they found Daniels, do you know where he is?
Find out who.
Tell him you're going to meet him and that you have a new phone for him.  57 
We're not going to stop him. We're going to follow him. He'll take us right to Daniels.
Alright, we need to be dead. You need to code that in.
I can see all their faces. But I can't remember any names....
I was starting to remember who they were...in India...with Marie.
I've killed people and I've tried to apologize for what I've done, for what I am. None of it makes it better...
They're going to come for you again. You are going to have to run now.
It gets easier.
I hear you're still looking for me.
Get some rest, Pam.
We'd be having this conversation face-to-face.
10-13. Shots fired. Officer down. Port Authority parking lot. Level four.
They'll kill you for giving me this place.
Why'd you do it?
Then stop it. Everything you need is in there.
This is where it started for me, this is where it ends.
I've spent three years running. Three years trying to find out who I was.
Let's start with the moment you found out I wouldn't execute Wombosi. The amnesia wasn't the issue, it was the fact that I didn't pull the trigger....
It was always you, behind Conklin, behind Abbott.... They were just following orders.
against the wall) "David." I'm David Webb.
Why me? Why did you pick me?
What does that mean?
Yes, sir.
You said I'd be saving American lives. Instead you just turned me into a killer.
I'll be whoever you need me to be, sir.
Who is he?
What did he do?
I remember. I remember everything.
I'm done running. That's why I'm here. To end you, to shut this down. I'm no longer Jason Bourne.
No. You don't deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley.
Do you even know why you're trying to kill me? Look at what they make you give.
