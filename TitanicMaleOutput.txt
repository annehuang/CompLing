 Come left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it.
 Do you see it? I don't see it... there!
 It still gets me every time.
 Is just your guilt because of estealing from the dead.
 Thanks, Tolya. Work with me, here.
 It still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above.
 You are so full of shit, boss.
 Right. Let's go to work.
 I'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54.
 Stay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday.
 I'm tryin' boss.
 I'm crossing the bedroom.
 Okay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door.
 Easy, Lewis. Take it slow.
 Ooohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'?
 Oh baby baby baby.
 Who's the best? Say it.
 You are, Lewis.
 Well, here it is, the moment of truth. Here's where we find out if the time, the sweat, the money spent to charter this ship and these subs, to come out here to the middle of the North Atlantic... were worth it. If what we think is in that same... is in that safe... it will be.
 Shit.
 You know, boss, this happened to Geraldo and his career never recovered.

 You send out what I tell you when I tell you. I'm signing your paychecks, not 60 minutes. Now get set up for the uplink.
 How it's going? It's going like a first date in prison, whattaya think?!
 Hi, Dave? Barry? Look, it wasn't in the safe... no, look, don't worry about it, there're still plenty of places it could be... in the floor debris in the suite, in the mother's room, in the purser's safe on C deck...
 I'll be God damned.
 Yes, hi, Tracy. You know, Titanic is not just A shipwrick, Titanic is THE shipwreck. It's the Mount Everest of shipwrecks.
 Nobody called the recovery of the artifacts from King Tut's tomb grave robbing. I have museum-trained experts here, making sure this stuff is preserved and catalogued properly. Look at this drawing, which was found today...
 ...a piece of paper that's been underwater for 84 years... and my team are able to preserve it intanct. Should this have remained unseen at the bottom of the ocean for eternity, when we can see it and enjoy it now...?
 Bobby, we're launching. See these submersibles here, going in the water? Take a message.
 This is Brock Lovett. What can I do for you, Mrs... ?
 ... Mrs. Calvert?

 She's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe.
 She says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now.
 A hundred and one next month.
 Okay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead.
 And everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it?
 S'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends.
 Is your stateroom alright?
 Would you like anything?
 Louis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond.
 I tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost?
 Nathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship.
 If your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank.

 Deal.
 Are you ready to go back to Titanic?
 Live from 12,000 feet.
 The bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. Here... I can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here.
 We've put together the world's largest database on the Titanic. Okay, here...
 Rose might not want to see this, Lewis.
 She hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. Now she's flooding in the
 The bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. KABOOM!
 The stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.
 Will you share it with us?
 Tell us, Rose.
 Just tell us what you can--
 You can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths.
 Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth.
 It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
 I put my faith in you, good sir.

 We'd better hurry. This way, ladies.
 Steady!!
 Sorry squire!
 Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
 All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
 I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
 Here I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution.

 The moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change.
 Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm.
 What sorry? What you got? You lose my money?? Ma va fa'n culo testa di cazzo--
 Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...

 Porca Madonna!! YEEAAAAA!!!

 L'AMERICA!!!  Olaf balls up one huge farmer's fist. We think he's going to clobber Jack, but he swings round and punches Sven, who flops backward onto the floor and sits there, looking depressed. Olaf forgets about Jack and Fabrizio, who are dancing around, and goes into a rapid harangue of his stupid cousin.
 Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot-dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
 You see? Is my destinio!! Like I told you. I go to l'America!! To be a millionaire!!
 Shit!! Come on, Fabri!
 Wait!! We're passengers!


 We are the luckiest sons of bitches in the world!
 You know somebody?
 Of course not. That's not the point.
 Goodbye! I will never forget you!!
 Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.

 Put that in the wardrobe.

 The first and only. Forever.
 I can see the Statue of Liberty already.
 ...and our master shipbuilder, Mr. Andrews here, designed her from the keel plates up.
 She knows.

 Yes, actually. I wanted to convey sheer size. And size means stability, luxury... and safety--

 That's so we know where we rank in the scheme of things.
 Don't do it.
 Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
 No you won't.
 You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
 I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
 I'm a good swimmer.
 It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.

 Ever been to Wisconsin?
 Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the--
 Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain.
 That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
 Come on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand.
 I'm Jack Dawson.
 I've got you. I won't let go.
 What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
 An accident?!
 You wanted to see the propellers?
 Uh huh. That was pretty much it.

 Oh, right. Mr. Lovejoy. A twenty should do it.
 Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
 I know.

 Good. Settled then.
 This should be amusing.

 You'll want to tie those.

 I intended to save this till the engagement gals next week. But I thought tonight, perhaps a reminder of my feeling for you...
 Daimond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
 It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the--
 It's for royalty. And we are royalty.
 There's nothing I couldn't give you. There's nothing I'd deny you if you would deny me. Open your heart to me, Rose.
 Well, that's the general idea, my dear.
 So let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic?


 Rose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that?
 Wait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination?
 Maybe she wants to make peace with the past.
 Then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.
 Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there.
 No Italian? Some little English?
 Hello again.
 Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
 So, you got a name by the way?
 That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
 Jack.
 Well, here you are.
 You're welcome. Rose.
 That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
 Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
 That penguin last night, is he one of them?
 Is he your boyfriend?
 Gawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom.
 So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
 So don't marry him.
 It is that simple.
 Well, I guess I will tonight.
 Just some sketches.
 Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
 Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
 I just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway.
 Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
 She had beautiful hands.

 I see you.
 You wouldn'ta jumped.
 So you've not lit the last four boilers then?

 Of course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all.

 I'm sorry. Really... I am.
 Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angelas to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.

 Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
 Sure. If you like.
 They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
 Your turn.
 Nope, that was pitiful. Here, like this... you hawk it down... HHHNNNK!... then roll it on your tongue, up to the front, like thith, then a big breath and PLOOOW!! You see the range on that thing?
 That was great!
 Not really.
 I saw that in a nickelodean once, and I always wanted to do it.

 Yeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up.
 Thank you.
 No, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually.
 The best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats.
 Mr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night.


 Well, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor.
 Well... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count.
 I work my way from place to place. Tramp steamers and such. I won my ticket on Titanic here in a lucky hand at poker.
 A real man makes his own luck, Archie.
 He knows every rivet in her, don't you Thomas?
 His blood and soul are in the ship. She may be mine on paper, but in the eyes of God she belongs to Thomas Andrews.
 No thanks. I'm heading back.
 Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
 Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
 Want to go to a real party?
 You're still my best girl, Cora.
 Just move with me. Don't think.
 How you two doin'?
 I don't know hwat she's say, she don't know what I say, so we get along fine.
 Boys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse?
 You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
 Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
 That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
 What would you wish for?
 Rose!!
 I had hoped you would come to me last night.
 Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
 You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
 Yes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear?
 I was just here last night... don't you remember?
 Mr. Hockley and Mrs. DeWitt Bukater continue to be most appreciative of your assistance. They asked me to give you this in gratitude--
 I don't want money, I--
 --and also to remind you that you hold a third class ticket and your presence here is no longer appropriate.
 I just need to talk to Rose for a--
 Gentlemen, please see that Mr. Dawson gets back where he belongs.
 Reminds me of my Harvard days.
 It was them, not her.
 Amore is'a not logical.

 Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and--
 No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
 I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
 You're right. Only you can do that.
 Sssshh. Come here.
 Close your eyes.
 Okay. Open them.

 Don't you love it? There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand...

 Isn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny.
 Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
 What is it? A sapphire?
 Uh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it.

 What, uh... happened next?
 None of the stewards have seen her.

 Miss Rose? Hello?
 Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
 Kinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh!
 After you, m'lady.

 Where to, Miss?
 Are you nervous?
 It's okay. I'm alright.
 I can feel your heart beating.
 I have a better idea.
 This is crazy.
 Hard a' starboard.
 Hard a 'port!

 An iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and I--  SMITH  Close the emergency doors.
 The doors are closed.
 Ma-- che cazzo!
 Looks okay. I don't see anything.
 It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
 Yes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now you moron!
 Why have we stopped?
 Well, do you think the ship is seriously damaged?

 Now it's worse.
 Right.
 We've been looking for you miss.
 That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back...
 This is horseshit.
 That's it.
 Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
 Of course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe.

 They put it in my pocket!

 I was going to return it! Rose--
 Rose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it!
 When can we get underway, do you think?
 But this ship can't sink!
 Two thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir.
 It is a little slut, isn't it?
 Look at me, you little--
 Get out. We're busy.
 This is ridiculous.
 They've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them.
 It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
 My God.
 Go on. I'll keep an eye on him.
 Stay here, Ruth.
 You know... I believe this ship may sink.
 Compliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley.
 There is no time to waste!
 Do you know who I am?

 Not the better half.
 Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
 Shit.
 Help!! Somebody!! Can anybody hear me?!
 ROSE!! In here!
 That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
 See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
 So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
 You have to go for help.
 I'll wait here.
 We'll find out.
 Try a couple practice swings.
 Now try to hit the same mark again.
 Okay, that's enough practice.

 Nice work, there, Paul Bunyan.
 Shit! Excuse my French. Ow ow ow, that is cold! Come on, let's go.
 Too deep. We gotta find another way out.
 She's not on the starboard side either.
 We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet...
 The one on the other side is letting men in.
 Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance.
 Fabrizio! Fabri!
 The boats are all going.
 We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
 Well, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast.

 Helga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to go to America.
 I will never forget you.


 God damn it to Hell son of a bitch!!
 Ben, what's the occasion?
 That's admirable, Ben.
 We're too late.
 There are still some boats forward. Stay with this one... Murdoch. He seems to be quite... practical.
 It's starting to fall apart. We don't have much time.
 Mr. Murdoch, I'm a businessman, as you know, and I have a business proposition for you.
 So we have an understanding then?

 I've found her. She's just over on the port side. With him.
 Women and children? Any more women and children?
 God damn it to hell! Come on.

 Please get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa.
 You better check out the other side.
 Get in the boat, Rose.
 Yes. Get in the boat, Rose.
 My God, look at you.
 Go on. I'll get the next one.


 Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.

 Almost as good as you.
 I always win, Jack. One way or another.
 No Rose! NOOOO!!
 Rose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot--
 Right.

 What could possible be funny?
 I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
 I give it to you... if you can get it.

 Compliments of the Chippewa Falls Dawsons.
 Let's go.
 Come on.
 Back! Go back!!
 Wait! Wait! Help us! Unlock the gate.
 Come on! Come on!
 I'll shoot any man who tries to get past me.
 We had a deal, damn you.
 Get back!

 There, there.

 Get back! You'll swamp us!
 Okay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible.

 Yeah, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death--
 You wanna walk a little faster through that valley, fella?
 Come on, Rose. We can't expect God to do all the work for us.
 We have to move!
 Come on! I've got you!

 Swim, Rose! SWIM!
 Keep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it.
 Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
 I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
 It's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under.
 Let me try at least, or I'll die soon.
 You'll die quicker if you come any closer.
 Yes, I see. Good luck to you then.
 Stay back! Keep off!
 You don't... understand... I have... to get... to America.

 The boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back.
 Please... help us. Save one life! SAVE ON LIFE!
 Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
 I don't know about you, but I intend to write a strongly worded letter to the White Star Line about all this.
 No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
 You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
 Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
 It brought me to you. And I'm thankful, Rose. I'm thankful.
 You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
 Never let go.
 Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you--

 You're precious to me, Rose.
 We never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all.
 We were pissin' in the wind the whole time.
 Oh shit.
 You had it the entire time?!
 Holy shit.
 Don't drop it Rose.


 Just let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once.
 My God.
 Aww!! That really sucks, lady!
 Would you like to dance?
