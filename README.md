All of the code is in the Code directory. This code was prepared using the scientific distribution of Python. The specific modules that need to be installed to run this code include nltk, sklearn and lda, among others.

Included are two modules: ParseFiles.py, and ScriptFunctions.py. They should be run in that order.

ScriptFunctions.py parses the files from the corpus.
ParseFunctions.py runs the NLTK stemmer, LDA, and the Stanford parser.

We also use the GitHub repository BTM.
