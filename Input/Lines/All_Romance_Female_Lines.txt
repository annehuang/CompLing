And what did you say?
Oh, yes. You noticed the way she does her hair.
Something else. My wife, Madeleine, has several pieces of jewelry that belonged to Carlotta. She inherited them. Never wore them, they were too old-fashioned... until now. Now, when she is alone, she gets them out and looks at them handles them gently, curiously... puts them on and stares at herself in the mirror... and goes into that other world... is someone else again.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Oh.
No.
That's a big help. Where are you from?
Not what. Who. What is for things.  What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he?  Who is she?  Who are you?  Who am I?
Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
So you agree you need help?
Why?
Like me.
What's the matter?
Take...take a year.  Take six months.  Whatever you want.  Who knows?  Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Good.
Look.  Listen.  Listen.  You want to write?  Write.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Going north?
I was a successful model once.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Well, I got homework.
I don't know.
Something mi trabajo.
Spanish.
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Yes.
I'm sorry, I'm just frightened. Yes.
Will you let me go then?
If you'll let me go I could tell them what --
Just don't... I've got a headache.
You all set here?
You'll see.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Why are you doing this?
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
Nothing at all?
I love Janis.
What happened, Ted? What went wrong?
Oh, thanks.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
Come on.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?!  Now hold on!  Wait one damn minute!
To bed?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I don't know.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
No.
I felt somebody had read my book and was playing a game.
I loved him.  I hurt.
That's right.
Here. Let me put these in some rubbing alcohol.
I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
I don't think I belong here.
What do you think?
Tell me...
Get up!!
That's just what you would say.  This is so unreal.  I'm dreaming...
Believe in Penny Priddy?
You've got your six guns strapped on.  You're ridding off on another adventure?  Oh, my God, it's all real...it really is real.  I should go with you.  Please...
Actually, she was my discovery... just like you.
She’s drunk. -er than me. But I didn’t really dump you, did I?
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yeah, my grammy.
Uh-huh.
Very good.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I know where he goes.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
No, it's me, Mrs. Brenner. I thought you might like some tea.
Yes.
It's a coincidence.
It's a miracle.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
Thanks. So do you.
Oh.
I don't look too foolish?
...  so you see in a former lifetime I'm sure that I was Alexandria, the Czarette of Russia? What do you think?
Dad, are you okay in there?
That's five.  So.  Why did you decide to deejay again?
Fine.  That's great.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter.  I'll do one.  My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Don't let's talk about it.
Okay, okay.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Come on, Barney, you and me live in the real world.  You don't know how to treat a girl like anything but a lady, Mr. Thomas.
Nnnnn.  I just killed the surprise.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Oh tsht. Yes.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Yes, I do.
Go home now.
I should do this.
Why'd you lie?
No, you weren't
Were you in jail?
When you were gone last year -- where were you?
This.
It's really a wretched morning... wretched. I can't get myself right. I wanted to look mellow and I look brittle. My face doesn't compose well... all highlights... how can I dim myself down, Leon? Suggest something. I am so bored with this face. I wish I had someone else's face. Whose face would you have if you had your choice? Oh, well, I guess one gets the face one deserves.
Hello, Leon!
Yes.
I wasn't dating him.  I was fucking him.
Yes.
About a year and a half.
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
Swell--You've got Times Square right here--all but the noises--
The most important thing. Is being together.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
Well, the school will be here. Architecture will still be around. Right now...
It was a long time ago -
But not you.
Oh, no! Give me time to change and get fixed up!
Ahh, Rodin. Mmm! He's the fuc-  I mean, he's the best. You must go to the Rodin sculpture garden, in the huitieme, it's so beautiful.
Because I remind you of her?
A la votre.
So's Woody Allen.  No, your uncle really helped me. I was sort of messed up for a while. Wasting my time just partying and... just stupid shit. He kind of woke me up, gave me a job, got me taking classes.  You know, he and Claude, their work is controversial, but they're serious about it. Totally dedicated.
Shit! You bought enough pate for a fucking army!
He said don't go nowhere. We'll be there some time tomorrow.
It's okay.
If you're here.
Do you want to stay here?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing.  One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
No.
I've been to a few -- yes.
I've tried it.
How was it?
To death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
It's so unfair.
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
You've done five of my ideas.
Spence.
I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid.
Of course I do?  Bring them up!
The Sig Sauer you got me for my birthday.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Okay.
Dinoine chagantakat!
George.
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Yes.
I already said hello.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino!  Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
Tell me. I'll listen.  I just want you to tell me.
I said yes, I see.
Like?
I don't get the humor of that remark.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
That's crazy -- why not?
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now.  I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
No. Don't do this.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
No -- only occasional jobs.
You <U>are</U> a lunatic!
Moreover --
Moreover...
Well, quick -- get into bed.  Are you all right?
So you like me, huh?
Anita, remember espadrilles?
My husband will be back quite late.
No.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Did you know that?
The fireworks are about to start.
No thanks.
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't tell me --
Please let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Yes.
Who is it?
Jack came out of a bank he just robbed in Pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start.  Battery was dead.  He looks over, sees Buddy sitting in a burgundy Bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. Turns out, Buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing.  Buddy says, I'll take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.  They musta robbed fifty banks together.
Till they got busted.
That wasn't Jack's fault.  No, that was on account of Buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job <u>before</u> they'd done it instead of after.  She called the FBI and they both went down, ended up at Lompoc.  I think Buddy felt kinda bad about that.
Any idea where I could find Buddy?  Or Glenn?
Oh.  Uh-huh.
Oh, hi.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Can't you see it?
Promise?
You have beautiful things.  How much is this?
I know you're her bodyguard.  Did she buy it or did you?
Why?
Hi.  Just checking to see if you're here.
Yes.  Something... conservative.
I'm just looking, thanks.
Baby!  Rodeo Drive.
In Beverly Hills?
Hey Kit, where do I go for the clothes?  Good stuff on <u>him</u>.
I know.  I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Fine. How's your eye?
That's up to you.
I never thought he'd do it.
They've got my Amado.
When I was a little girl, my mother locked me in the attic when I was bad, which was pretty often. I'd stare out the window up there and make believe I was a princess trapped in the tower by the wicked queen.  Then suddenly a knight on a white horse with his bright colors flying would ride up. Rescue me from the tower, and then we'd ride off... but never, ever in all the times I had that dream did the knight say, "Come on baby, I'll put you up in a great condo."
Come, now, you must not talk that way.... You have to adjust yourselves.... We must be brave.
Edward... you got it!
What's your name, lover.
Three hundred.
You couldn't afford it.
No, I haven't.  And you forgot about the fortune teller.
Look, I know you think this is irresponsible of me, but think how much more irresponsible it would be to marry the wrong person.
What?
Dad, no.  But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
No... wait.  Hold me.
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Mitch...
It's so late.
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Let's leave here.
So where'd you say you was?
Sail?
Yeah... He was lookin' for you.
Some... Sparky said Red's promised to have him and Buddy out of here by the weekend.
He said it was a gift.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.  Here.
I told you. I was hungry.
I know you do.
You didn't ask me here to pick me up. You could get in trouble for that.
Have you ever been married, Miles?
You don't believe in it.
Well--you boys stopped fighting yet?  Are you pals now?  Good.  I love a little macho male bonding-- I think it's sweet even if it's probably latent homosexuality being "re-channeled" but I believe in "re-channeling" so who cares, right?  Shall we go to my place?
It's so blue.
When do we start?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
I see.  But I hope you have a lot of sugar.  Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life—styles.
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks. So do you.
I know. He's just the best.
Will you please take it?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
No, don't open it yet -- I'll be embarrassed.
Oh no.  It's all nonsense, believe me. I had no idea how much nonsense it all was -- but nonsense it all is...  Well, yesterday was our last day filming and so I'm just off -- but I brought you this from home, and...
I thought I'd give it to you.
Well... how have you been?
Peter Finch.
Well... sure...
Faye Dunaway.
And who's Jill?
Who is there?
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
You should know. She's in your dream.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
But the rest is right.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
I'm looking for a friend of mine I think Maurice knows.

Bye Niece, Vada.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
You're right. Good.
No. But I'm taping her show every day so she can watch it when she comes back.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
But he knows you.  All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy!  Is she here?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Can't we really go home?  I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow.  If you wanted.
What?
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Oh great!!
I won, I won!!!
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... · organize an expedition -
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Don't worry about Paley.  He can't touch me.  No one can.  I've thought it all out.
What a beautiful thought.
You know what's wrong.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
I never know anymore.
What is it?
Some of them are.
Yes, that's a particularly dangerous time.
Are you sure you wouldn't like to see a canary instead? We have some very nice canaries this week.
Well... they get a sort of hangdog expression.
I'll never meet the man of my dreams.
You want to get out of here, run, it'll warm you up.
Gee, I wonder why not.
But you say he hasn't shown up, you think he backed out?
Why's that?
But listen, Glenn.  If you're lying to me...
Bye.
How long can he stay down?  Without breathing?
No! I just wanted
What? To completely damage me?  To send me to therapy forever? What?
Am I supposed to feel better? Like, right now?  Or do I have some time to think about it?
Two?
Yeah?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Yes, that's why I said it.
Lightning struck.  We caught it in a bottle.  Don't let it out.  I want to be with you, Joe --
Don't.  That will come later.
It's a saying.
'Love will find out the way'.
I don't think so.  Of course I was terribly upset...  I hardly knew what I was doing.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
What are these?
Did you hide the letters?
Okay.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
That ' s completely adorable!
$2,400?!  Are you out of your mind?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars.  C’mon, take it off.  We’ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
We can see what's going on anywhere on Earth. Look.
All these good people have totally been led astray.
I'll call her later.
What happened, Duff?
I go on rounds.
What are you two up to?
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
This is my good John Brown.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Sure.
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
But Richard, no, I, I --
I don't think so.
Cosmo?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin.  Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him.  Are you armed?  No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
I wish I could.
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
You leave the kid alone.
I see.
Flowers. That's funny.
Do you want to get it now?
Why don't you get it.
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
So we're gonna be close next year?
Sure.
Yeah.  You know, people are always like, "What're you gonna major in?" And I don't know.  And they're like, "You'll figure it out."  Yeah?  When?
Oh thank God, I thought I was the only one.
Yeah.  So wow, you've got it figured out.
It's Thanksgiving.
Go to the northeast corner.  Call a cab.  Bring the pizza.  Then there's a poem.  Roses are red, violets are blue, if the Pope goes to Washington, I would, too.
He missed me.
No -- you're not.
You're too weak, Frank.  When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it.  If something gets in your way you remove it.
Fuck him!  He tried to shatter mine.
I do need you.  No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I knew you were thinking that.  I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom.  You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
Did you kill him?
Did you kill my father?
You needn't see anybody. You can come directly to my study. I'd appreciate it very much if—
Yup.
Thank you.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
No way!  I'd cramp his style.  And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall.  I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers!  I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it.  My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
You better not have too much joy.
Gonna get married...
What are you doing here?
DON'T SPEAK!
That's all!
And a little ice!
Rain.
Oh. The bullets.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
Well.  You've been introduced to the symphonic range of...
But he sure can kiss.
Yes.
What?
No fear.
Oh my God, does this mean you're becoming normal?
It means that Gigglepuss is playing at Club Skunk and we're going.
Oh, I thought you might have a date  I don't know why I'm bothering to ask, but are you going to Bogey Lowenstein's party Saturday night?
What do you think?
I think you're a freak.  I think you do this to torture me.  And I think you suck.
You think this'll work?
Catherine Tramell.
What was she like?
In his apartment.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats.  You go out in them. You come back in them.  I hate them.
Kimmy! What's the matter?
Someone from the office.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
I know. Because I remind you of her. The one that's dead. And not even that, very much.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
You wanted to tussle, we tussled.
It's not the thinking of it, it's the doing it.
And a target guaranteed to catch his interest.
How ill is he?
Then why are you not with him?
What is the matter with him?
Why was I not informed?
You must have me confused with—
Haven't you been listening?
Why not?
Is that so important, Mrs. Brenner? You liking me?
Because my son is...  My son seems to be fond of you.  And I...  I'm not quite sure how I feel about it. I really don't know if I... like you or not.
Why, Mrs. Brenner?
No.  No... don't go yet.  I feel as if I... I don't understand you. And I want so much to understand.
Would you like to rest now, Mrs. Brenner.
I miss him.  You know, sometimes I wake up in the morning, and I think 'I have to make Frank's breakfast,' and I... I get up and there's a... a very good reason for getting out of bed until... until, of course, I remember.  I miss talking to him.  Cathy's a child, you know, and Mitch...  ...Mitch has his own life.  I'm glad he stayed here today. I feel safer with him here.
I wish I could be that way.
Yes.
I'm not this way, you know. Not usually. I don't fuss and fret over my children.  When Frank died...  You see, he knew the children, he really knew them. He had the knack of being able to enter into their world, of becoming a part of them. That's a rare talent.
Annie's there. She'll be all right.
We just live one flight up.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team.  With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
We've done the hard part now.  I might as well, you know...
San Agamat chay bet... envolet!
He asked where you were!  He wants you with him.
Napoleon... small.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
His face.
Who told!
Roger in Op/Ed.
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
Like that!
No!
But incidentally, let me tell you, <u>I</u> don't like <u>you</u>. I don't like you at all!  I wouldn't hesitate one instant to ruin <u>your</u> reputation--like that!
Yes, I would!
Dead?
What's the matter?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Sweeney?  Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
It's getting quiet.
Stop!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we?  I want to go home.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Adam!!
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
Look butthead, I'll treat you so nice you'll never want to let me go, okay?
Did you?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
What was this one?
I really do think it's the best night of my life.
I was hopin' you would. I know that night by heart. Sometimes, honey? I think it's the best night of my life.
You think so, baby? Does my talkin' bother you, honey?
Talkin's good. Long as you got the other? I'm a big believer in talkin', case you ain't noticed.
It wasn't only that--Ned was in a jam.
-- No. No really.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Don’t  go, Jack...
Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
We're being responsible.  Go. Get on the plane.
I know!  I know!
Nothing.
Akta dedero ansila do mektet.
It must be something.
Yes, you did.
What did you say?
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
Oh.
Your hearse?
Of course, I've had to make some additions for the new models, but not as many as you might think. Once you have your basic set it's then only a question of variation.
Not <u>any</u> car. I like to keep a variety. I'm always looking for the new experience, like this one. I liked it.
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Yes.  My room is down here -- I'm not tired.  Do you want to keep talking?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail.  So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
But you have problems?
How are you at back rubs?
Consider this my resignation --
Yes, I'm ready.  Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Yes.
And you, you-you're going?
You look it too.  You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins!  You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
I'll get some towels.
You want to go with me?
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
I'm excited Sports Illustrated gave him this kind of shot, he's only there a ye...
A detective.  He falls for the wrong woman.
No thank you.
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales...  or are you still over your limit?
And you're not now?
David, let's go now.
David, don't lose control.
What did you think, Ted? That you could spy on me and trick me into thinking you were someone I could... really go for?
Get out.
That you put a murderer on my trail?
My name is Penny. Penny Priddy.  There I've said it, but it won't mean anything to you.  I'm a nobody.
Did I say anything was wrong? I just sponged up a little too much Vat 69, okay? I'm down to my last nickel in this lousy town, I can't get my luggage outta hock 'cause I met this jerk who said he was a record producer when all he had was a record.  He offered to set me up for life, and like a fool, well, I...
Do I look like that kinda girl?  I lost my room this morning.  I don't know where I'm gonna sleep tonight, but I keep going.  What the hell else can I do?  I've still got my figure, and like this bozo said, as long as there's a sidewalk, I'll always have a job.
You're saying the thief wants us to think it's Mac but it's really not.
Mac's signature.
Do you still teach?
Hi!  Hi!
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
He's probably on the bum and wants to touch you for the price of a drink.
I don't know it.  I feel it.
Niece?
Can't all husbands be perfect, and your Elmo prob'ly wouldn'ta ever got that second one pregnant, you hadn't kicked his ass out.
Meetin' him at the gate. That phone call this afternoon was the signal. My deranged mama's hid the keys to my car. But of course, I know exactly where they are.
Seein's how you're about as thick as a used string of unwaxed dental floss, don't know how you can criticize.
Real soon... I'll be makin' the swap tomorrow, and thanks again, Beany.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
I like that too.
Good.  Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Yes, but what happened to George?
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is.  Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and <u>we're</u> the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things?  That's just not right.
Darling!
I can't imagine you crying.
I'm telling you your life!
Plato, where's your father now?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down.
If it's in Italian, how will I know what they're saying?
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Oh-oh! Touché, Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh?  No. Don’t. You might get confused speaking of things you don’t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you’ve done what we are paying you for.
I came with Captain Renault.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Monsieur Rick?
So are you.  Are you shaking?
He's my friend, too.
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
I love you.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Yes, I'm glad.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
You didn't care about my case?
Beyond reason.  The feminist warrior will rise up in this kid, and she'll be standing over his sleeping form with a butcher knife, selecting from a short list of body parts!
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
Aw, c'mon -- anybody can get hungry.
What?  I may lose it again? But I haven't found it yet! I'm sorry. Goodbye!  Yes?
What about Larry?
And Larry?...
Kate is that you?
I didn't expect you back so soon.
Uh huh.
Actually, no.  There's not going to be a wedding.
Well, I realized, if you're getting married, you're gonna be needing the maid of honor, right?
Well... I ought to be getting home anyway.  The kids'll be back from camp soon.  The house is probably a mess.
Oh.
But, darling, they've offered me a chance to head up the computer analysis division for the Jupiter probe.
And I can hardly believe that I'm engaged to someone like you, Simon.  I'm a very lucky woman.
Simon.
What are you going to do with it?
Where did you get that?
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
What time does the show go on?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
I don't think so.
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared...  But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous.  You still live in Rome?
<u>Am</u> <u>Berliner</u> <u>Zug</u>.
<u>Auf</u> <u>wiedersehn</u>.
Yes.
He's playing a stupid joke, sir.
We had an argument. He's being silly.
I guess getting him whacked would be politically out of the question.
Can you fly?
You can't walk out of here like this.
Stewart!
Your house?
But "nice".
That's nice.  And you live in Queens?  With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
You don't like him, do you?
Oh.  Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
So find a dime.  Let's get out of here.
Jack... Oh, Jack... Help me...
Do it now!
You... you... you mortal you!
I'm trying not to.  I just wanna know what's gonna happen.
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Well, let's hope so.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's.  I do the, uh, crêpes caviar.
We need more bread and some baked lasa--  uh, lasagne.  Hi.
Well, be kind. I've lived a long time, Harold, seen evil as well as good, and it has been my experience that kindness...
Just my dad.
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
So am I.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
I have loved more deeply than a killer like yourself could ever dream.
Too late... there's something I must do...
If you'll release me ... whatever you ask for ransom ... you'll get it, I promise you...
Where did you find that?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
What's this now?
Well spoke, boy.  You have discerning taste for one so young... Just who might you be?
Come closer then, Jack, that I might give you proper thanks.
Think me fair, do you, Jack?
The moon is too round of face, methinks.
If your ass isn't chapped, you are not a good-writer of note.
Is it sad to be an editor, and bask only in reflected insincerity?
Is Newsday a real interview, or just some cute guy you're setting me up w...
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I wish that doctor'd come.  How do you feel?
No, I'm serious.
Patience.  Concentrate.  You will find a way.
I see.
It's a fax from Sports Illustrated from Ben Isaacson, Michael's boss.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
As above, so below.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Ok, well... I love you.
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
Where are they?  Shopping together?
Oooh, thank god.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
That sounds great — can you hold on...  What Zoe?
Yeah.
Hi. Hey.
Why?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Can I stay here tonight?  Even if she comes here?
Jack.
From Hurley's?
Where will we go?
If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I don't know.  I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again.  I...I have to leave.  I have to move out.
Because I have to!
No.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
All right, cut me a break.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
One to five?
And there is a Russian saying: "The cat who has cream on his whiskers had better find good excuses."
Friends... friends, Buljanoff, Iranoff...
Is it possible to bring you back to reality for a moment? I must have a complete report of your negotiations and a detailed expense account.
Don't make it difficult for me. This is no more a pleasure trip for me than it is for you.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
Wait --
Ted, there's no time to explain.
Ted!
No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there.
I... I didn't think you would... I'm sorry... I believed that son-of-a- bitch...
You fucking liar!
What?
You're what?
My father's the preacher.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
That's right.
I have feelings for you.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
I was devastated.
Why are you doing this?
Here with you.
Tired.
Do I!?  Momma!
Want a pair of boots?
So did I.  I made it with the principal.  Study hard And get a "B."  Lift your dress and an "A" you'll see.
That woman!
Get a job and probably go back to school.  Figure out what I'm gonna be.
'Pro bono'.  That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
So whatta' you going to do in San Francisco?
I did.
Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.'  And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.  That's the first reason.
I'm sorry. Forgive me.
No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.
Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay?
You get straight to the point, don't you?
I see.
So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.
And the second?
I wanted to be near Mitch.  It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway.  You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever.
How do you do. Would you care to finish the game? I have a slight earache.  --and it's so noisy up here.
Feeling a little better, I see.
You sure you won't come with me?
Thank you.  So, since I have a few more days of vacation left, I was wondering if maybe you'd want to do something sometime.  I mean, you know, if you don't have... other plans.
No... Like a psychiatrist.
I don't care what you wanted to tell me.  You're through!  Get your things and get out!
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
You sure this is your car?
No.
Did it really go well?
Okay.  Sorry.  Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
I am breaking her heart in the short run, but doing her a gigantic favor! She would be miserable tagging along after this insensitive doofus!
You're here?
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Pop don't like Johnny.
You okay?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Same way you did.  Through that gate.
Nothing.
Good evening.
And isn't it a lovely one?  So sturdy, so straight --
Don't worry about it, boss.
My mission in life.
Sweating like a pig, actually.  And yourself?
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
What will happen to him, Ted?
You mean...
Not when I'm with you, Ted.
What do you mean, "possessed?"
I don't know.
That's really romantic.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
What's inside?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
And the other alternative?
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
Occupied France?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
Would you like a drink now?
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless  thing, don't you?
Well, that's blunt!
What's that supposed to mean?
Wazoo!  Try to listen.  Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Yeah...before your time.
Stu. That was right about the time we met.
I don't know. I guess it was...
Oh, poor Buster. He hasn't been fed in a day and a half. Let me get some food...
He hadn't gotten a good night's sleep in years. The nightmares would wake him up, and he'd start right in painting... <i></i> That boy looked like pluperfect hell.
I won't.
You're not really serious about this, are you?
Uh huh.
Oh yes, of course.
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Hmmm....
Yes, but George . . .
Too much--Remember--I warned you about me--  I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose.  Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
Hey, yourself.  I see you’ve met my ex.
I'm crazy about the kid and I got him into it.  What do you want me to do?
Must be the Spring.
Why, you don't have to apologize, Mr. Warne. You'll never know how much I appreciate all this.
Nope. No complaints.
Thank you.  My, my! Scrambled eggs.
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
Yeah. Bye.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
It's enough isn't it?
You know what I mean babe, It's enough. We can stop.
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Well, I guess she's more around your age...  You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
That was lovely.
I'll do anything for you.
The woman at my dry cleaners believes there's no such thing as coincidence.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
Sailor, what are we gonna do?
SAILOR!!!
Oh God, Sailor.
What's that?
You think she's gonna make it?
Scared? Swimming underwater with that oxygen device of yours. I was petrified.
No. It had nothing on this afternoon.
I'm leaving from the Nathan Road Station at 6:30 tomorrow morning. You could come too.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
--you're going to be on your own.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
I'm going to disappear. I die in a car crash in Taiwan. Very easy to do.
Not for me.
Benjamin.
Why don't you watch?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
We're not going to sleep out here, are we?
Peter—
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Show me.
The poor thing....
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
I suppose so.
Are you going to see him?
Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
Where you from?
Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
Which side are you with?
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very-  a very good driver.  So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Wisconsin.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
You go home.
Saw the sign outside.  Got your own sign, huh?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
See you over there, Miles.
I'm pregnant.
You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, George, George!
Oh, George, George, George.
George, darling! Where have you been?
I wish.
To be strong and free... that is all I desire.
Now I want to live forever.  I've never felt so strong or happy.
It's odd... when I first found myself... changing... I was sick with loathing and disgust.  I thought I was so ugly I wanted to die...
I do.
Are those for me?
Do you think you'll find her?
You'll love them.  We're going down to D.C.  tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
You can see me now.
Something wrong?
That bastard.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
George? Was he alone?
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
I like him a lot.
Unbelievable.  This is a nightmare.
Yes.  Cathy Lee Crosby stayed here.
Well, we're here.  And more importantly, he's here.  We'll cut back on everything else.
"Of the Rich and Famous".  Of which we are neither.  Are you out of your mind?  We can't afford this.
Are you sure?
Dad, you and I have talked about this.  Lloyd and I have talked about this.  Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
You ask what room he's in, okay?
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
Yes! That's right!
I couldn't think of anything more boring and tiresome than what you've been through. And the last week must be the hardest.
Yes, yes it is!
Just open the door.
Probably as small as Mandrake Falls.
I'm from a small town too, you know.
Oh, yes. I used to have a lot of fun there when I was a little girl. I used to love to go fishing with my father. That's funny. He was a lot like you, my father was. Talked like you, too. Sometimes he'd let me hold the line while he smoked - and we'd just sit there for hours. And after awhile, for no reason, I'd go over and kiss him and sit in his lap. He never said very much but once I remember him saying: "No matter what happens, honey, don't complain."
I've often thought about going back.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
Why not?
Yes.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
I can't explain this, Alice, but I'm not so sure it did. It's as if...he's <u>not Stu</u> any more. The Stu I love is gone! <i></i> He spends all his time in the garage. He says he's...autographing.
The thing is, I'm responsible for the way he's acting. It's the nightmare juice. It's got to be.
Forgive me, I beg you --
Maroon.  I stole it.
The LeSabre!
He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
What?
Yeah, me too.
Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
I gotta go make dinner.
Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
Sure you don't want any salad?
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
I like to play "reality".
You're Nick's mother?
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
I sit. I think. I play games.
What are you saying?
I get all the glamour jobs.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Well, they can be.
Yes.  You know all the shrinks on Donahue say that all those love songs about some enchanted evening are just a cruel hoax that feeds people's fantasies.
But somebody wrote those songs.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
--You'll have all the boys tipping their hats to you--  --let me wipe it off.
Salary. Unreported income.  By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road?
Darling!  Now tell me--tell me all about yourself. Who are you?
Monescu!
Arty Farty stuff.  Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients.
He's heeeeeerrre...
Do I have to spell it out?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Oh my God.  Where?
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
He's sitting in the fourth booth down, on the left hand side, with his back to us.  He's wearing a navy jacket.  If you turn around, you can see part of his right elbow.
It's twelve o'clock.
Nope.
I've been all right.
Yes, madame?
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
So here we go.
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
She told me I was charming and relentless, and would go far in this town. And she said that unlike the other charming, relentless people she knew, she liked me.
Carleton School of Nursing. Two semesters, but Del made me give it up...
You told me that two hours ago.
I haven't been this happy since I was twelve years old.
For Mother's Day, I used all my allowance that I'd been saving to take my mother to Kansas City. We got our nails done and had lunch at "Skies," a restaurant at the top of a building from where you can see the whole city. It was the last outing we took together. She died the following year.
I just want everything to be perfect between us.
You're acting like a school girl.
What else can I do? Keeping this up is no good. He's bound to find out sometime.  At least I can save him that .
What's she like?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
I'm positive.
Just a minute. No, you don't.
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
So what went wrong?
Morning!
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
Oh, hush up.
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
No.
Oh, it's just so romantic.  I just want to put on a long gown...
Great.
Hold the record. Alone.
Okay, 80-20--
If that's all right.
She's gone, Leon.
It feels like you're in France.
Sure.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Yeah.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
It's French, though.  It really is.
Yeah.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp.  But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
Well, under the circumstances, don't you think we ought to call this thing off?
It's no use, Dad. I practically threw myself at him.
Well, what are we going to do about it? Where is he?
He's marvelous!
I'd like to have a talk with him.
I don't know.
Well!
He doesn't think so much of you either.
Fine man to fall in love with.
He blames you for everything that's wrong about me. Thinks you raised me stupidly.
Now, just a minute—you can't—
You have your nerve!  Here, boy—!
That's none of your business.
Good.
Thanks.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look?
Give me some credit, will you?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You don't understand that do you?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy.  Love.
Isn't that my drink?
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Please -- just let me sleep.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Yes, of course.
Last night he proposed to me.
Sixty—forty.
Just a moment. I don't see how that trash could possibly concern me.
What do you want?
That's considerate of you.
I'm not interested in your literary recommendations.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah.
I am not a wealthy woman.
If it makes you feel any better, to get your number, I had to cough up two round-trip tickets to Amsterdam and a case of mini-Baileys.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
It's tainted money, Doctor.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What?
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
Nummers.
And what?
The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
Kate McConnell.
It's nothing.
How much for the phone calls?
I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
Yes?
Miss Hayworth?
Look, I'm a twenty-eight year old hoofer who spends most of her time with fags. Besides, I'm impulsive. It runs in the family. We're all crazy. Mind if I smoke?  Anyway, today was the 'bid day.' But as I was walking down the aisle, I realized this is total insanity. What am I going to do in Texas the rest of my life? I can't marry Jerry Jeff. I mean, we're eventually gonna have to talk. So, halfway down the aisle, I turned and split. You think I'm nuts, right?
I would not be too sure.
Why are you screaming at me? I mean, what am I... why am I here? I don't...
No, I... I'll leave. Forgive me if I caused you all any trouble... I just, I don't know how I...  ...I'm sorry.
Okay. I was in Texas dancing in an industrial show for Sunkist Oranges. They say I'm the new Anita Bryant. But I'm really a dancer from New York. A lot of credits. Moderate talent.  Anyway, after opening night, I was walking back to the motor lodge and suddenly there he was. A tall Texan with a twenty-nine inch waist. Pure dynamite.
--sorry--got an appointment to play shuffle-board.
So, why’d you say yes to me?
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Yes.
Enough to get to Jersey. I'll walk the rest of the way. I've been sitting a long time.  Nice meeting you. It's been a trip.
And who's Lydia?
Nothing.
How are you, Raymond?
Then why don't you take the job that Louie Netz offered you at Boeing?
I won't be back. I've requested the Atlanta run.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
Good-night.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
He is a sailor on the pirate ship "Revenge." Promise to return him to his ship.
Two men in the world don't need passwords or codes. Their retinas will scan to unlock everything. one of those two men is the chairman of the bank.
Parachute.
Pulse detectors.
If we surrender, and I return with you, will you promise not to hurt this man?
It's for the bell.
What happened at the luau?
He's going to be the pastor?
Come on, it'll give you a great view. It's perfect.  Hey.
Don't be nervous, Maggie.  Let us visualize.  Remember what Bob said? "Be the ball."
I guess she's busy.
Yes.
That's just so embarrassing.
You told me to change.
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus.
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Hell there's nothing so mysterious about the square life.
Ssh. He's great.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Aw... that's so sweet.
Do you want to-
But... You may not be well enough.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Goodbye, Miss Gallagher.
Thank you. I'll go and look for her at once. Goodbye, Mrs. Smith.
Miss Wilson will give you the guest list and any other details you may need, Miss Gallagher.
Yes - isn't it.
Indeed? How interesting.
They all consider me just as one of the boys.
No? What do you look upon her as?
Oh look what he did in them.
Thank you.  I'm just in London for two days -- but, with your papers, it's the worse place to be.
I... I never lied!
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
A bath would be great.
You're also an idiot.
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you.  But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself.  I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
C'mon.
Quien es? [Who is it?]
Don't you open them anymore?
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Good-by.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
No no, I'm fine, really...
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you?  You're more adorable than your pictures.  Look what I got for you.
Beautiful.
Well, why not?  Hey, what is this?  My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
How do you know?
You don't know how to love.
Seven-fifty. Positively my last offer.
Branding?  I haven't branded in years.
I'll come.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Oh, you know what.  I'm suffocating!
Listen to you!  You sound like Betty, all pissed off because Archie is taking Veronica.
Hi, Joey.
Because you're leaning?  No, you're just on an angle.  You're too heavy!
He can't even move.
There were some shots.
Something was just missing.
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's a trip, you know?  When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
I get it!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
Oh, please, it was long over by then.  God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
Oh!
Oh, Walter.  I don't deserve you.
You okay?
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building.  I'm here.
Tell me.
He likes to read...  Did he mention anyone in particular?
Mickey Spillane?
Well, I guess I walked too much. I've been looking for a job all day. I found one, too. I start tomorrow.  You've been awfully kind. Thank you very much.
Mmm, it tastes so good. Mr. Deeds, I don't know how I can ever thank you.
Well, I guess I've told you almost everything there is to tell. My folks live in a small town near Hartford. I'm down here alone trying to make a living.  Oh, I'm really just a nobody.
Oh, that was so lovely. Thank you.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie? Was I dead?
What about Janet?
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
You look adorable.
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Sure. No problem.
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
I need it.
He wants to talk to you.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
... What?... You don't want to commute?
... I would love to start looking at least.  You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
It was the owl--come to bed
Then why are you so upset?
You would not leave me?
Moonlight!
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
You'll think me very bold, sir.
Do you know what I was doing in that shop?
Nope. The CD instructs the computer to replace those instructions with an innocuous loan coded XJ-6.
I don't know. Please...
I'll play you.
What's wrong now?
Good.  'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
Whatever the reason, I’m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Have you finished?
Just a little.
An attempted slit.
I realize that the men of this fine institution are severely lacking, but killing yourself so you can be with William Shakespeare is beyond the scope of normal teenage obsessions.  You're venturing far past daytime talk show fodder and entering the world of those who need very expensive therapy.
But imagine the things he'd say during sex.
You couldn't wait until morning?
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
I'm at Adele Delisi's.
<u>No</u>.
What?
Huh! Don’t you recall convincing me he had?  You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
Yes.
Yes.
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
I'm leaving the house around midnight.  In case you're going to follow me.  I'm going down to Johnny's club.
Hello?
Yeah?
Oh, he's not getting away with anything.
Look, I can do it!
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Five CC's.
What's the maximum safe dose?
You smell weird.
You're late, George.
Who's Spalding?
I don't.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho.  But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
And?  She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
Oh no.
I never met my mother.
My mother.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
No.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
I can't move.  I can't get out.
Somewhere where there are no police, and plenty to eat.
Please don't move me.  It hurts too much.
We can't stop him. Not now. Handcuffed, with no kind of weapons. Please Andy...
I know where he'll go.
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god’s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
It's me?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not?  You know, wh-what have I got to lose?  Uh...
Really?
You found all this, all this out on one date?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical.  Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I think he was dying to open up.  It's so sad.  Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you.  She's a brain.
Brains stay with brains.  The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
What's lucky about that?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes *every* night.
No, you don't owe me anything.
Why?
Dinner... and what else?
What?
I trusted you.  I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
You let me believe you.  You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it.  God, how... how could you...
No, but you stole from them.
You stole from them, you lied to me.  How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
You must have been dreaming.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
You did it. You gave it all up for me. I . . . I don't know what to say.
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
I know what they're worth.  Give me fifty and get them out.
Not at all.
He's pretty laid back, confident.
I want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.
How's everything, Gus?
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
You want to take your bath?  We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
Really?
Where’s my real dad?
You still didn't answer my question.
They did a pretty good job.
Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know.  He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Get going.
Gay.
Right.
Do you mind?  I'm-I'm my own person.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be <u>ten years</u> before these plaintiffs see their money?
You don't have a headache. I have a headache.
We had a good laugh, didn't we?
Of course you will.
You're acting kind of...odd.
Stu, are you...feeling okay?
Baby? Why don't you just...rest on the sofa for a minute. I'll be right back.
I wouldn't know.  I never had that many first thoughts.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
Give it to me.
How are you?....  Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now....  No, she isn't here.  Is it about her father?  Well, can I take the message?
Dad, I'm trying.  The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday?  Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Don't be silly.  I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Even when you were young?
What happened to Sam?
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No!  I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
To avoid killing anyone.
Yes.
My uncle—Mother's brother—had four children . . . and I've seen them ride "piggy-back."
That's silly.
And rich people have none of those qualifications, I suppose.
You're prejudiced.
Oz, it's okay, I know.
Well, that's what your friends call you.  I mean...I feel like I'm one of your friends now...and also...your girlfriend.
Hmm.  You know that's  really a shitty middle name!
It took some high-powered acting, believe me.
Had the boys follow us.
No one's asking you not to work.  I just think you could make some time for your son.
It's good to see you. Well -- could we do it first and then just talk?
Except for Small Eyes.
Maybe I want to die. Don't you want me to die?
I smoke more these days. I smoke more when I'm unhappy.
I'm trying to quit.
I'm outta here.
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
You did.
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
And how long are you here for?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I'd like to, thanks.
I don't understa-
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
I'm sorry Miles. You shouldn't listen to me. I'm sure you have a very fulfilling life. I'd better go. I'm depressing.
Thank you for the coffee. It's very robust.
Friends?
We're damaged goods.
We are, Miles. You know I'm right. There's something "off" about you and me Miles. And maybe it isn't because of these women -- maybe they were just extremely insightful and recognized our "deficiencies" very early on. Maybe...
How awful.  What will you do?
Oh really?
Not at all.  I was thoroughly enjoying by book.  Please.  Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
-- well, more than anything else --  -- I'd like to suck his cock.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Okay.  In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You bastard...
One, two, three...
Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Hi.
Harry, I really think she.....
Uh huh.
Rob's?
And I thought I was weird.
I don't.  I know you wouldn't.
Don't tell me you did it on my account!  hope you're not getting any idea that what happened last night is—  You needn't concern yourself about me, young man. I can take care of myself.
Seems to me I've already thanked you for that.  What time is the next bus to New York?
Eight o'clock! Why, that's twelve hours!
What are you excited about? You missed the bus, too.
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
They had to pump it out.
Thanks for reminding me.
It means a lot.
You're right.  Easy come, easy go.
What a nasty thing to say.
How's everything at the apartment?
Warren!
Are you okay?
You have had girlfriends?
What is he up to now?
This is a very presumptuous and burdensome fav...
It’s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you’re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don’t have time for wining and dining.
Now let's forget everything except that we're together.
What?
Yeah?
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
We lost him.
When is that, George?
Who with?
How well do you know her?
I could see you were pining away--
Step aside.
Are you okay?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Hello, John.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing.  A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Pop.
Yes.
Yes.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Let go of me.
I'd like you to leave now.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Ted, I loved you and I'll always love you. But I need Simon.  He's stable.  He's a good provider.  I want that at this stage of the game, Ted.  He might have his faults, but Simon doesn't know the meaning of the word fear and I need that in a man.
Don't be too long.
Ted, please.  You're just making things difficult for yourself.
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed.  Yikes.  Bikes!
Ex-cuse me?
You are <u<so right.  What a nerve on that guy!  Bring my dress to church, huh?
Yeah?
Oh both of you, of course...
Actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. It's all Quantum Physics and molecular attraction.  There are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.
I'm going to have one of those big beautiful steaks.  And... let's see... to start...
So far.  But that place is a pig sty.  I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town.  It's impossible.
Ten.  There's a lot of other places I could work.
I'm suddenly hungry. Would you rather go somewhere else?
Too late. I've got my face on.
What?
What are you doing here?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Isn't that awfully forward?
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway?  I mean...  it's not sexual anymore.  It's certainly not intellectual.  I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Tell egghead I said hi.  If you see him.
Listen... you want to get a drink?  I got a new place.  Or we could go to a bar ...  Well, maybe not a bar.  But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Oh. Carrots.  And peas.  None of the important ones.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
--but you're father's in there!
Praise the Lord, eh?
He's a good student.
So am I.  Nuke, honey, we need to talk--
You don't have to...
No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
Take me away from here?
...somewhere in the light.
In my back yard.  I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
Well, nothin' personal, but I ain't sure it's okay by me.
The truth. I just left you out of it.
What would you do up here?
I was twelve.
What happened to them?
No, sir. Of course, sir. Good day, Doctor.
Yes, Doctor?
He said 'Jack'.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about?  Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that.  And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
No.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
I'm so very sad.
You know the deal.  I can ' t go if Kat doesn't go --
What are you doing here?
You 're so --
Are you all right?
I'm sorry. I should've told you, he's got a thing about his ears.
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I don't know the finish yet.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
About what?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Thank you.  I think so too.  That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing.  I don't mean to be a pain in PG&E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it.  And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I adore things like that....food I can't do without.  Don't you?
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Your Majesty
It's not the place. I don't buy that.  Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
I know, I'm sorry.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I am? I mean why?
Anyway, you're crazy.
So what's your point?
Well, he is.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
You're not very ambitious, are you?
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Later. Go back to sleep.
You kidding?  We must've killed three pots in there.  Anyway, I gotta get home.  Rest the pipes.
If there was, I didn't see it...
Goodnight.
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
To the other side of the street.
If you need me, I'll be --
No...
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame.  Shit.
Uh-uh.  I never touch American cigarettes.  What's tomorrow again?
Nice place.  Fulla velvet.  Even the bedspreads.  Damn!  Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Paris Opals.  Twelve-and-a-half cents.  I sat down with a pencil and added it one day.  But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best.  Ah, here's a lost soul.
No!
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week.
Yes, I do.
No.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Yes.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
Did you get the letter?
I just thought it would be nice.
You're not gonna start that again.
Goodnight.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
What is this? Is this a... Present?  Are you kidding?
I've never been to Louisville.
No, I'm fine.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed.  You know what I'm saying? HANNAH  Oh, no, not at all.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me.  It's not fair!  I want a less complicated life, Frederick.  I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Hush, sweetheart.
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
It's about time.
It's me... Johana.
Yeah.  Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
But Marylin, without this, you're completely exposed.
I want this to be a marriage based on love, trust and community property. That's all I've ever wanted.
I want to be exposed.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
Sure.  What's that funny smell?
Oh.
I'll heat some up. My, it's nice to see you again, Harold. How's your hearse?
If you say so.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
Why?
Crash...I want you.
What'd he say?
Nuke!  You got things all wrong! There's no relation between sex and baseball.  Ask Crash.
Cute?!  I hate cute!  Baby ducks are cute!  I wanta be exotic and mysterious!
Great.  Another deadbeat.
I told you -- with my mother.
Some setup you got here.  A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Well?
Yeah.  I'm probably ruining them.
Don't be a jerk.  There's no such thing as love at first sight.
I'm never here.  I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
... Since eight o'clock last night...!  You're in love.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
But why me?
Yep. Mitch and the little girl.
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
I see. How do I get down there?
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Then why don't you write about something you know?  Write about yourself and Anne. The poor boy who marries a rich girl - now there's a swell theme.
Well, it ain't your baby.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Ufa!
Ah?
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
No time.
Which would you rather...?
I'm not going back on our arrangement. My word is good, and my family owes you. But I think it's best for both of us if you get your own place as soon as you can.
Were you really a prize fighter?
IT'S NOT ABOUT GAS MONEY!!  You have a thing for an actor on a stupid white soap opera, and we searched all over town for his character! Not the actor -- whose name is George, by the way. His character!
If you didn't want to do it, you should have said so! Is this about gas money?
I spent my weekend looking for someone who does -- not -- exist. I should have been here at the hospital with my brother, but I was with you.
Shhh! I heard you the first time.
HE IS REAL!!
I helped you because I'm an idiot! Ask my mother, I love it when people take advantage of me! I TRUSTED YOU!! I THOUGHT HE WAS REAL!
Why'd you help me in the first place?
Frank -- It's Rebecca.  I need to see you right away.  I've got the tape.
That's crazy.
Scottie!
Sure, disappear. We’ve been walking away our whole lives.
Hey.
They're colored! Just to make him look silly!
Yes, but I—
Yes!
NO!!
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
It isn't all! I'd like to explain—
Darling, remember you're Gaston Monescu. You're a crook. I want you as a crook. I love you as a crook. I worship you as a crook. Steal, swindle, rob--but don't become one of those useless, good-for-nothing gigolos!
Gaston. Let's open it--right now! Let's get away from here!  I don't like this place!
Oh darling, of course it would. If it isn't - there are six rooms and two baths - but if that isn't enough, Mother will give us the blue room too, I think.
Anything.
Oh.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
Let me go now, you'll make me late.
But we don't need it, I'm sure.
The what?
Two miles.
It was in her favorite handbag -- And, Mr. Doyle, that can lead to only one conclusion.
Don't go telling anyone.  It'll ruin my reputation.
You already packed up your stuff?
I need it.
What?
Where's my paycheck?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
I don't want to be reminded of what happened.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
About ten dollars.
Cheap date.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
No.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
Okay, I will.
They're big details, Jerry.
What was he doing down here?  A billionaire waiting for the subway?  Why not drown him in a bus?  Why drown him at all?  Why not shoot him?  Is the hitman from the lost world of Atlantis?  I mean, come on.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
You what?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
So. Anything else?
We do not go into your courts.
It's in a very pretty area that gets a lot of sun, has palm trees out front, mountains in the background...
Of course, he's only here two days a week. He's also on staff over at Loma Vista.
Oh no.  I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up.  Thanks, though. Bye.
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you.  A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped.  They wouldn't raise a hand to help you.  And I've given my whole life for you.  If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter!  Sure I took those bonds.  Who has a better right -- ?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Go???
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Aarrggh.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!!  I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
You don't?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
It doesn't matter.  Really.  I think I can muddle through.  Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife -  One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
What's April 16th?
I can't sing.  but I can tell a story.  I might need a prompt.  Do you have your Herodotus?  I've noticed you carry it…
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
He's one of the best fliers in the country. Right now he's planning a trip to Japan.
You talk as if he were a gigolo—or something.
That was enough. Do you mind handing me the ketchup?
Nothing much. I just think he's a fake, that's all.
What've you got against King Westley?
I'll do it if it takes every penny I've got. I'll do it if I have to bribe that musical comedy Justice of the Peace! I'll do it—if I have to prove that you were dragged in, staggering drunk. You probably were.  Mmm—mmm. This filet mignon is divine!
You'll never do it! You can't do it!
I'll get it annulled.
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Oh yes, yes. It has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... I see...
Everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. I am a traitor. When I kissed you I betrayed the Russian ideal. Leon, I should be stood up against the wall.
Much happier.
I have paid the penalty. Now let's have some music.
Radio! What is radio?
Yeah, you met her?
To that stewardess?
Yeah.  Can't wait to see him  I just saw Quincy.
I can manage.
Engaged.
How is he?
So what do I do?
MICHAEL!!
Well, if that's the way you f...
Michael, it sounds like a wonderful opportun...
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Bye.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Andy...  this is Nick Charles.  He worked on a case for father.
was fascinated with you....  a real live detective....  You used to tell me the most wonderful stories.  Were they true?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
'kay.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Yikes.
It won't sell.
I'm very good at research.  I'll help you.
What are you researching?
Really.  What are you writing about.
What happens to them?
I am... I did slave all day.
Not particularly.
We have it on video!  Was that when?  My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I'm fine.  Nothing.  I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
He must have known Charles pretty well.
Do you know him?
He's allergic to him.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie.
Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me.
You're a goddess!
Murdered?
Good call.
No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired.
Well, sure.
Good.  Total exhaustion can be spiritually fabulous.  Let's play catch.
What is this "I, I, I" stuff? You only talk about yourself? Aren't you glad to see me?  Don't I look nice?
That too tight?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
Yeah, that's him.  Buddy says Glenn thinks you guys are real cool.
Yes.
Candy.
What?! That you had something to do with it?
I don't know. I'm just starting to remember it now. I don't...
Yeah, but your running away isn't going to help you with all this...
There was blood everywhere, Rosa. I saw it, I think I watched the whole thing happen... Oh my God...
Okay, okay, look, ummm... Let's just talk a little first and you'll feel better, I promise.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Yes, Pimenov.  One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Good morning, Pimenov.
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
I'm a little late, that's all.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
Wonderful -- if one could believe it.
No.
Settle it yourself.  What have I got a lawyer for?
No.
Really, no.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
I don't know if that's such a--
Why are you doing this?
I just got here, too.  Not yesterday.  But, just now.  Today. Just a few minutes ago.  Yeah, we just got here...  I mean, I just got here.  I'm single.
Okay.
What a nice place.
When does the bus leave?
Thank you.
My stomach's growling.
Ugh, not pecs. Sounds like one of those guys with a fish-net shirt and a banana hammock.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I was looking for you.
Oh, don't say those words!
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Oh.
Yes, I would.
Nothing.
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
I don't believe you.
And I want to be with someone who understands the meaning of the word commitment.
The marriage is off. Now you can screw around with your friends for the rest of your life.
Let go of me!
Rick, you're lying!
What's that?
This isn't the best way to proposition me.
This isn't any better, Chris.
I'm the photographer.
What do you think?
Is it against the law?
Why not?
Doctor King is my favorite.
Let me hear it!
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Well...  So you tried riding again?
About what?
Whatever happens.
No, it was so right it scares me.
I've got to go --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Why?
They must work on the section gang.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
For what?
Maybe I'll just order a burger, Barney, that way I can eat with my hands.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
-- I'll get in the back --
Relax. Take a breath and just say it. It’s no big deal. I promise.
Actually.  Lower.  I am the fungus that feeds on pond scum.  Lower. The layer of mucous that cruds up the fung...
I don't have a problem with it.
Steve?
What happened, Nick?  Did you get sucked into it? Did you like it too much?
Yes.  She's helped me understand homicidal impulse.
Only in theory.  You know all about homicidal impulse, don't you, shooter?  Not in theory -- in practice.
Yes, you did.  They never tested you, did they?  But Internal Affairs knew.
Why?
Johnny, the doctors explained --
Lloyd.
It wasn't your fault.
I'm afraid you have to eat something.
No.  Why?  I like to be with Sam.
Home after.  Will you come in and say "hi"?
Nothing R, okay?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
It's ok, take your time.
Why not?  If you hit twenty homers this year you'll be the all time minor league champ!  The record's
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
And your Social Security number.
How'd you get this number?
What does your gut say?
Is that all there is to it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
What?
Okay.  I'm sorry I said your dream was stupid.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
Looks slow tonight.
Maybe we should get a pimp. Carlos likes you and --
Forget it.  We work for it.  We keep it.
I can't handle this tonight. I'm going home.
I love you too... too late... too late...
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's freezing out here.
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
Good to see you're feeling better.
Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh--
Get over here.
Last fall, I drove you from the Palm Beach county jail to the federal courthouse, twice.  You're Glenn Michaels.  I never forget anyone I've cuffed and shackled.
People can see.
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
Do you?
What a memory.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
I know.
Oh my god.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Hear one.  Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
You're twenty-three years old!
I do not deny its beauty, but it is a waste of electricity.
That's a strange angle.
You gave me some very valuable information. Thank you.
Yes, it is.
Do not misunderstand me. I do not hold your frivolity against you.  As basic material you might not be bad, but you are the unfortunate product of a doomed culture. I feel sorry for you.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
Oh, my God.
It's a good day.  I feel good.
How do you know that?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Both.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
The judge came up with a number.
I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hello.  It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven.  He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
What's wrong?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming.  He's all right.  For Now.  Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten.  I can't help it.  I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
Maybe my mama cares for me just a little too much...
We gotta be careful, honey, my mama's gonna have Johnnie Farragut on us like a duck on a june bug, and he's one clever detective? You know how clever? He once told me that he could find an honest man in Washington. My toenails gotta dry first anyways, Sailor.
What?
I beg your pardon?
Hey, Sailor boy, you wanna fuck Lula's mama?...
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
What?
Oh, you've thought of everything. And champagne.
And when things get in your way— or people —you just knock them aside— get rid of Them— is that your idea?
Oh, I was just wondering, if I were to bring in Chirino, would you put me on the task force?
Sure, Daniel.
Yeah, I know.  I was just leaving. Why were you trying to reach me?
Goodbye, mother.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you!  I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you.  Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music.  I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I think it is.
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
I don't understand --
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
A secret, I like that.
Okay.
I should do this myself.
Hi again, how's it going?
Are you sure this is a good idea?
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Sssh! Once and for all, we're in Moscow!
And it's great! Think what it was a few years ago and what it is now.
The same spring we had in Paris. Just as good.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead!  Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Coach...
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling.  It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do?  I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
When we were together I was “too here,” now I’m not here enough.
Seven if you count the on-and-off years. Which I do.
Not for a dog.
Is this supposed to be an apology?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
Oh my...  Don't leave...
No ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.
I didn’t intend it that way... It just happened.  He heard from Laurence that you’d been back.  That we’d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn’t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
My husband didn’t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us?  About our-our personal life?
We should be going --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Should I?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
I think I would.  And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it.  Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Get away from me... get away!  She means that much to you, you stay with her.  But you come back, you come back for me.  Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
I'm staying here.
I want to know you.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Mrs. Thorwald?
Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong?
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Recall the time we was sittin' one night behind the Confederate soldier? Leanin' against it. And you took your hand and put it on your heart and you said, 'You feel it beatin' in there, Lula?... Get used to it, 'cause it belongs to you now.' D'you recall that?
Shhhhh... It's four o'clock... That woman's laugh the other day had somethin' to do with this feelin'?... Like bein' ripped apart by a gorilla, maybe... Grabbed sudden and pulled apart real quick by a real powerful one.
Ever imagine what it'd be like to get eaten alive by a wild beast? Sometimes I think it would be the biggest thrill?
You certain?
Like heroin?
The Fountainhead.
Best friends.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
You'd do that for me?
Oh. What?
Really?  Well, come on, then.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do.  Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Oh, me too.  I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
It was the least we could do.  And I love to cook.
No.  The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
You have to know what you're talking about.
Shhhh.
Oh! You didn't read it!
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
Well--how do you do, M'sieu Laval?
I'm just going to the bathroom.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Where do you want to do this?
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
They're in 7D.
The manager's door is metal.
You're gonna use a ram?
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
What's my problem? You want a list?
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
You -- covered in my vomit.
Or I did it for some kind of kinky thrill.  Score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
Mom, don’t you think we need to open the presents?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Rise...and...shine...!
You’re jumping, sweetheart...
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Thanks.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
He wants to speak with you.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life.  They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off.  Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
And? What are you saying?
And who says what is wrong.
What's a moral orgasm John? Tell me how it feels exactly.
Whereas "Wet 'n' Wild" is an emotional journey. "Tied and Tethered". It's pretty moving huh? Like Anna Karenina.
What are you talking about?
I thought you were giving up that drug shit.
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Don't make conversation with me.
Yes.
Well, how about this?
Are you?
Well, what?  What, wh-what are you not telling me?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about?  Of course not.  I'd be destroyed!
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
They wouldn't know.
Johnnie, I can't tell you, honey. Is there anyway we can get on the road tonight? We've got to find them kids.
What is it, Johnnie?
Oh.  Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Would you hold this for me?
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
Sweetie, have you ever heard of Walt Whitman?
But, Harold, we begin to die as soon as we are born. What is so strange about death? It's no surprise. It's part of life. It's change.
Oh, I am happy, Harold. Ecstatically happy. I couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell.
Oh yes, dear. I took the pills an hour ago. I should be gone by midnight.
Oh, Harold! What a fuss this is.  So unnecessary.
Why yes. It's my eightieth birthday.
He knows everything.
I'll never tell.
Don't, Lee--that's dead.
Brain washing, mind control, that sort of thing?
I didn't know the C.I.A. had psychiatrists.
I was just thinking that.
So who... Who’s the man? Where is he?
Look, you don’t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn’t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who’s the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
I'll rephrase the question.
Italian? The Mafia...?
Do you like it?
Bookshelf. Sensors--
And you've got me all figured out?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
Hey, we're connected.
Mr Brown.
You are here safely.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Like what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
Do they know them?
Will you not come in?
And her <u>jewelry</u> is worth a fortune!
Hey.
Here.
Can I go too?
Why?
You never cared before.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
No.
Yeah.
Nothing.
And she'll end up fat, alcoholic and miserable.
Keep your mind off her.
Isn't there anyone in the neighborhood who might cast an eye in her direction?
Poor girl. Someday she'll find her happiness.
He and his wife splitting up?
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I probably meant it when I said it.  Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
It's Elijah.
The monkey.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Hi.
Did you eat?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
Five, seven, and nine--
Filiba ...
Apipoulai!
Love...
What is it you want? What?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose.  What is it, Mom? No kidding.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married.  Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any.  Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
His— racket?
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh.
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
And this is Helen Carter.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on.  Are you going far?
As far as -- Sonora?
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
You must take me for a real idiot.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
Why not?
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I...  turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
What are the boys like?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I stay here because I am happy.  Is that such a terrible crime?
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity.  I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Why should they?
Try less appropriate.
Stop by later.
No. But I have a hangover.
How about what?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Uh hum.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
So who's the lucky guy?
Because marrying that fool King Westley is—
Why do you think?  About my staying?
You ought to know why. Because—
Yes. I know.  Because I'm your daughter and you love me. Because you don't want me to make any mistakes. Because—
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
No gas... car dead.  We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Yes. Very good.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
And you've put it over--haven't you?
And you can't tell me who you are.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
Family?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
Well, stop the world.
Great.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
Shit.  I think I started a fire.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah... No.
Rosalind and Orlando.  From "As You Like It"?  Shakespeare?
Where's the old lady?
So I can move on.  You too.
How can you not think so? You know the things I can do.
What?
Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.
Well, not in your mind, but maybe . . .deep in your heart . . .
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski.  The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
Yeah, I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
Still got my picture, I see--I was pretty dumb then, wasn't I, Chad?
Johnny.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Love it.
Okay, pal...  I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Sorry.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age...  how old are you?
Oh, please...
I'm a sales rep.  I came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because I'm a girl.
Destiny takes a hand.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
How amazing.
It's silly, really.  I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
I notice these things are back in fashion.  Oh, honey.  He's a lovely man, Annie.
The bridge won't wait!
Okay.  Thanks, Barney.  You're the best.
But Ted, you're the only...
You know what. Kill me. Cut out my fucking heart. Go on! Do it!
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Or have perfect table manners.
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Where did he get all that information?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
I drink.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy.  Thank you very much, Mr...?
Can we go now?
You are so completely unbalanced.
Why?
You still get the pleasure.  Didn't you ever fuck anybody else while you were married, Nick?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
Why don't you leave me alone?
You get wise to <U>yourself</U>! If you know what's good for you, you'll leave me alone. Everybody's entitled to one mistake--Well--you're mine. When the going got too rough, I pulled up stakes and quit. We stay quit!--Get that!--And what're you going to do about it?
He's all right.
I... Edward...
I'm -- I'm with a friend.
What?
No, on the porch.
I wouldn't have let you.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
Here we are.  Do you want to come up?
What's the matter with my brains?
That's disgusting!
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Seven years.  One baptism?  He's your mother's only brother
Sure.  I won't hold my breath.
I better get the kids home.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Yes.
What?
Not particularly.
Yes.
"What's happening." Oh, is that the understatement of the year. Well, so . . . where do you want to . . . talk?
Your place?  Maybe I should change,  Maybe you should, too.
I know, I know.
Yeah.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Is this some kind of Gallup Poll, or something?
Listen, I'm going to yell in a minute!
0h, I thought so! A pick-up!  Well, you've got a nerve, following me right into the hotel and up to my room! You beat it! Go on! Beat it!
Don't worry, Wyatt.  My family's rich.
Wyatt!  My God...
You look nervous.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
Yeah, I have.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Well, are you here with anybody?
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
Well, it means another two weeks in Paris.
Oh yes, Power and Light. Thank you.
Well, there's nothing we can do about it. Why get excited?
Au revoir.
Huh?... Why don't you get a haircut, Buljanoff? You all look so wintry, Comrades. And why do we always keep the windows closed?  Isn't it amazing, at home there's still snow and ice and here... Look at the birds. I always felt a little hurt that our swallows deserted us in the winter for capitalistic countries. Now I know why. We have the high ideal but they have the climate... well, Comrades, I don't think I need you any more.
Where do you eat?
I am not so well-born.
Yeah.  There's two.  Why?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen.  Just wanna take good care of my kids.  You know?
I wouldn't mind a little night life. How about you?
Maybe there's a place we could hear some music. I feel like dancin'. We could ask someone.
So that's your little dancer that you were playing around with in New York.  Oh--there's no accounting for tastes--  Mine, too, seem to be in the gutter.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
Your desert island top-five.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Right.  So.  You must have an enormous record collection.
I don't know exactly.
Yes, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
Mmm.  Like kissing a rose.  Well, au revoir.
Yes.
No, I Just thought I'd wander.
Oh, great.
I don't know.
Wait!  Professor...?
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
My son... my mind...
Hmm.  Pretty good.
Well, thanks.
Oh no.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Do exactly what I say.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
Tons
But it's Gigglepuss - I know you like them.  I saw you there.
Yes.
How's not smoking?
No?
How about the coke?
How about the booze?
What's he talking about?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
I have no secrets from my family.
Um-hm. We rode around all afternoon. Father was frantic. By 6 o'clock he was having all the rivers dragged.
Allison.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yes.
Do you feel all right?
Adam?!
Really?  Don’t get too attached.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
I don't know...  Maybe.  Think of it as an adventure.
Then you'll die.
Don't do this.  I am literally begging you not to do this.  Chris.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
You don't believe that.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
Don't hit me.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Well, didn't you?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Yes.  Yes, I'm fine...  We need more brushwood!  Why are you staring at me like that?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
He said everyone was doing it.  So I did it.
That's what you want, isn't it?
I don't know... I thought...
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
I wanted him to marry her.
You could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?
You could see all the things he did, couldn't you?
And that's where you're not being clever. He wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.
Jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? That he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?
Don't you see how silly you're being?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
Oh, God, sweetheart, no.  There's nothing on Earth I love more than you.  Nothing.  I promise.
You can believe that if you want to.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Yes.
I never forget, honey.  I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay?  Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Bullshit.  You told me I'd get half a million dollars.  You told me I'd be set.
Hi, sweetie.  Were you a good girl?  Where are Matt and Katie?
For what?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
You know me.  I pick things up real fast.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better.  A lot of these folks aren't.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Robert. Please.  You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
You pay me.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Oh, don't get officious. You're not yourself when you're officious. That's the curse of a government job.
Officer, I can explain.
No.
We planted it.
But there is a family resemblance.
Mmm  you never know.  They might.  He's just trying to do the nice thing.
It moved me.  I did relate to it -- I really did.  It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff.  Okay?
You look better without make-up.
All right, hard guy.  Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta?  Your balloon busted?  So's mine.
Sit down!
Really.  Hm.
I'll say one thing for Jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. He was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what I mean.
He said he was a card player.  I could live with that.  I never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire -- if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. I did go see him in jail to tell him I was filing for divorce.  He said, "Okay."  Jack's so easy going.  He was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.
Did you know that when you married him?
Huh.  Problem is, Jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks.  It's all he's ever done.
Okay!
He did?  I don't remember.  Did he say about me?  In the trunk?
He called the day he escaped.
Buddy'll take care of him.  Keep him out've trouble.  He's Jack's conscience. Always has been.  He tell you how they met?
Adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught.  I'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.
Yes, Gaston?
Thank you.  Seventy-six, eighty--
My Dad was funny?
Do you like her?
I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
Okay.
He said he'd kill me.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning.  Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me.  I think he heard me peeing!  I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Only because it's expected of her.
Anything else bothering you?
No, but it's getting there.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Let's not close our eyes. There are many good things to see here too.
Only myself and two other girls. One is a cello player in the opera and the other a street-car conductor.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise.  What's with the stars?
That was a accident. I bet both our asses Bobby Peru done murdered all kinds of people, and meant it, too.
He's a stone fuckin' criminal, honey, and you ain't.
Who says I'm smart? You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru, Sailor?
Rather be in El Paso than Big Tuna.
I mean tomorrow.
Hold me --
-- Yes?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
All right, Miles. Let me tell you everything you THINK you know. I was married to Rex for a long time. I was an excellent wife, a partner, a lover, a hostess and a friend. There was only one thing I did wrong during the five years we were together. I got five years older. Think he should be able to ditch me for that?
Well, don't look at mine!
We haven't talked since high school.
I can't. I work.
Well, I don't know. Do you know, Harold?
Oh no! Not in <u>my</u> name.
Because if you are...
I write for you sometimes.
Billion.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
You heard what I said. I'm pregnant. I've been throwing up for weeks.
Say thank you.
Okay.  So what does 'just over the street' mean -- give it to me in yards.
I don't know.  Big.  Dark.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
The duck?
I know the porn career's a lie.
Tell me something true.
No -- something real.  Something no one else knows.
Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
You disappeared.
They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
Giovanni, I want to thank you.
We're not looking to arrest the man, Faith, we're trying to locate him.
Sure.  Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Not long at all, but I really like him.  Okay, I know he's a little different, Tucker, but that's what I like about him. He's a guy. A real guy. He dresses like a dork and eats corndogs and he isn't always politically correct and he probably farts, too. And that's okay with me.
I've been looking for a guy -- not one of these South Beach pussies.
No no no, Tucker, thank you.
I appreciate you looking out for me.
I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too.  Wanna see?
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
I'll write you ten poems.  Bye.
Aren't you?
I'm not pregnant.  I'm hot.  I'm too hot.
I'm fine.  I got hot.
It makes me sad.
Ahm.  That thing I was doing tonight -- I'm not doing it any more.  I told them I had to spend the evening with Britain's premier equestrian journalist.
What does it say?
You were never thirteen, Mom.
I got a dress.
Bleeding on a country road.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG&E told me.  They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
In and out.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
How's egghead?
It's the waves.  God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
I'm not the First Lady, anymore.  I shouldn't be here.
When were you all planning to tell me? A year from now?   After the election...  What's going on here? Dave hesitates.
I'm sure they did.  'State of Emergency.'  'National Security.' You ever hear of the Constitution?
Get his wine away.
Hello, Miss Daniels.
I better do this, Stan.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Hi.
How are you today?
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
'kay.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
And is Foley a part of this?
For the car, for aiding and abetting a prison escape, and conspiring to do whatever you came here for.
What's going on, Glenn?
But I thought the whole thing was your idea?
Ripley?  You mean the wall street guy?
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
Why?
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
I was so bored!
Thanks for a swell time.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference!  They're embalmed!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yes.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Since forever.
How long has he been having problems?
Emergency room only.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
No, it was more than that.  It was very generous of you.  It was very kind.
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light—headed.
What did he say?
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem!  I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay?  Please.
Oh...
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
I just want you to know, I love you Ted and always will.
Yes, it is.
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay.  Because I know you love me.  Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
That you've been to Susan?
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
You were meant to  You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
No. You’re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there.  Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit...  Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Probably.
You mean like you loved Mom?
...There's a start for a meeting.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
Terry!
The documents are forged.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
You were paid to take me out!  By -- the one person I truly hate.  I knew it was a set-up!
Really?  What was it like?  A down payment now, then a bonus for sleeping with me?
Mary Janes, Mom.  You promised.
We’re almost done here...
Look at me like you haven’t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Sorry, Jack.  It’s too important to me.
Trina this is Klute. I told you about him.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Pull over.
I'm not applying to college.
Yes, one of many.
No.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Goodnight.
Right.  My brother.
Well, it was a big deal. As late as...yesterday. Or this morning.  But not anymore.
It’s the past. It’s nothing but ghosts. So just get it off your chest, then let’s go back upstairs and eat some tiramisu.
Tell him about the party.
--you'd go with him!
You can't bluff me any more.
Not because of Ned.
They only made the one episode. They've shown it about nineteen times.
Don't move!
Boats.  All anyone talks about is the wind.  Is it up, is it down.  I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Oh, come on...  What kind of an excuse is that?
No. You listen to me.  You busted me, Miles. You left me with nothing! What did you expect me to do? Get a degree in counseling? Write a book about table linen? Because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, I'm not quite ready for that.
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
That was before I found out what it was.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
He's in Palermo.
You get lonely?
We told you. We realized we've always been in love.
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Really?  Cool.  Tell him his subs are great.
That's nice.
Yeah, well my parents wanted me to go to Northwestern.  I didn't want to write all those extra essays they make you do -- I mean, how am I supposed to know what my "most emotionally significant moment" was?  So when my U of M acceptance came in December, I said the hell with it.
What?
Oh, yeah.  So what're you gonna major in?
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
You're the Dread Pirate Roberts; admit it.
You go.  Send me a postcard.
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
The Conformist.
For now.  But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Yes I do!
Hello?
Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
You're really pissing me off.
Can't I just go with you guys?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
No, you wouldn't let me.  And I don't want to go...
-- or lack thereof?
Oh. I forgot.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and...  ...the wheel broke.  Can you fix it for us?
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
I like steak.
Steak spoon!
But what if they serve soup?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
No.  I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I think it's closed.
I figured you did.
Baby-sitting.  Rookie cop.
You okay?
You don't look so okay.
It's---beautiful.
You bought this for me?
This one's almost thirty years old. It's about a young kid and an old lady who fall in love.
That's it. We're ready.
Charged. Receiver?
What's a mook?
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Therapist.
Weird what you remember.
The trouble is, I'm gone now. For you. And I can't do anything about it. I want you to love me. If I let you change me, will that do it? If I do what you tell me, will you love me?
All right. Then I'll do it. Because I don't care about me anymore. I just want you to love me.
Ah, no!
You didn’t have to do that.
We would've had enough gas to get us there if you hadn't gotten us lost.  Besides, a kilometer is less than a mile.
Till it's in a powder.  The energy exits within you...
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
I should get back.
They've got me. Different thing.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
I'm sorry Charlie.
I'm already free...
I am ready now...
That's it.  It's over.  Get out.
...yes, I've got that bit...
I tried to.
I'm worried, Lovington. After all, something might have happened to her.
It's not enough!  Are you certain she's not with King Westley?
What I'm asking isn't impossible. My daughter is somewhere between here and Miami. I want her found!
Money.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
You don't know me.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You treat me like a loser.
I don't think you can take it personally--
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored.  That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
I said get out.
Please! Will you just --
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Because I want to make it tough for you.
I <u>must</u> go.
I know it.
I <u>believe</u> you.
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
You'll try again tomorrow?
No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son.
But really, m'sieu, this isn't necessary.
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before.  I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all.  I mean the radiation is gone and...
No one's forcing you to listen.
He's a writer, not a madman.
Once or twice.
Can I carry something for you, to the car?  Will you kiss me?
I'm sorry.  That's very sweet, Edward, and I know you mean it...
I'm stayin' right here by the phone until you find Lula, then I'm comin' to get her. You call soon's you got somethin', even if it's three in the a.m.
This is the kinda mistake can take a Hindu's lifetime to unfix... You better get a move on, Johnnie, before that boy got her holdin' down a Memphis streetcorner and shootin' dope up her arms.
Do me a favor, Sailor? Don't pick up no more hitchers, okay?
I know you're thinkin' that I got more'n some of my mama in me? Well, I couldn't help it. Sailor, I really couldn't. I'm sorry for that guy, but when he pulled that drippin' hunk of awful-smellin' meat out of his pocket? I near barfed. And them poor diseased puppies!
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
I just saw somebody pulled out of a dumpster.  I wonder how much she made tonight?
Lovely to meet you.
You're right.  I told you I was bad at acting.
Night, night, Honey.
Guy named Maurice Miller, also known as Snoopy, a former prizefighter.
Oh, so do I. They're such fun, aren't they? It's all change. All revolving. Burials and births. The end to the beginning and the beginning to the end -  - the great circle of life. My, this old thing handles well. Ever drive a hearse, Harold?
Oh, yes. How did you like that?
Oh, don't be too discouraged. For aesthetic appreciation - always a little time.
Well, it's a new experience for me.  Good on curves. Shall I take you home, Harold?
The Sheriff.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things.  Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track.  Did you go to college?
I trust you.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.
It was wonderful.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Mm hmm.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Edward, these women here, I don't think any of'm like the guys they're with.  They're just into it for the money.
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Sir, he's very upset. His friend was killed and...
Put down that gun, Earl.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
There are times when you don't answer the phone.
It wasn't an intrusion.  And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I'm okay--I can walk.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
Are you writing a poem?
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
Well, I was thinkin' about smokin' actually... My mama smokes Marlboros now, used to be she smoked Kools? I stole 'em from her beginnin' in about sixth grade. When I got old enough to buy my own, I bought those. Now I've just about settled on Mores, as you probably noticed? They're longer.
Hey baby...
'Bout fifty thousand times. I got us a room at the Cape Fear, and guess what?... I hear Powermad's at "The Hurricane."
Did you ever think somethin' like about the wicked witch of the east comin' flyin' in?... Did you ever think somethin' and then later think you've said it out loud to someone?
We don't have much time left!  Go on!  Go on!
You here to see my mother?
You should be ashamed of yourselves. Two men of your standing, always quarreling.
What's the magician's weapon?
Where have you been staying?
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Yes.
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Right here.  "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others.  I knew them all.  So did you.  We went to school with most of them.
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Through the door.  It comes apart.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Just do it!
Night. I'm going to stay with you.
Don't rush me. We have all night.
I'd like to see your friend's face when we tell him. He doesn't sound like much of a detective.
We'll agree they saw a woman -- but she wasn't Mrs. Thorwald. -- That is, yet.
Well, I have a pat rebuttal for Mr. Doyle -- that couldn't be Mrs. Thorwald -- or I don't know women.
Well, I'd like to - but I have a job to think of.
I enjoy it.
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
Is he a winner?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is that what makes a winner?
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Girls don't love their father? Since when?  Since I got to be sixteen?
Get out!
Didn't you hear what I said?
Would you like me to?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything?  Is that what you think?
No.
He's sleeping.
I feel like the world's biggest idiot.
Yeah.
I know.  But the toxicologist I been talking to?  He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
How come?
Parry Parry?
What's his problem?
No, he <u>works</u> too much.  He's chained to his desk. Too much detail. Now, if you could take over some of his work--
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
As I said, then it's God, right?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all.  But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Unreasonable!  Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
I think you should, Miss Gallagher.
I think I better go, Stew.
I just admire your maturity, that's all.  I mean, there are people who would find that kind of perfection boring.  Day after day, year after year...
Such as.
Hate that.
It was my cousin, Dell, done it? His folks used to visit with us summers.
I guess you're right.  That would be deceitful... manipulative... controlling... emascula...
...I hope you appreciate my spendin' six hundred dollars, not countin' what it cost us to get here and back... This man's the best damn abortionist in the South.
So it was "love".
Okay.  Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And "is"...?
When did you start drinking coffee?
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No, stay. Just for a little while.  Refill?
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
Why should I feel such pain?  Should be the other way round... I could vex you... make you dance your life away...
What care I for the human heart! Such a soft, spiritless thing it is. I prefer the hearts of hawks and wolves; fierce and free and keen as steel!
You beware, Jack!  You and your porridge-pot heart!
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op/Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
I love that.  That's my type.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
I'm sorry, but you three men can play poker or something.  Shall I see you tomorrow?
It doesn't matter, alright.  Just leave it alone.
"A habituè of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
Yeah, but I feel like crap. And if you feel like crap, it’s way better to look hot while you’re doing it.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Who told you?
Actually he said "glad." _ 85.
... his snoring, yeah.  He says it's worse than ever.  That snaffle one...?
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
What?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about.  His address is in this envelope with Leonard’s address, keys and other things you might need.
Good morning.  Did you know that?  You're always singing?
I think that's called looting.
Am I dead or not?
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
I didn't go in your room.
Room service.
I love you, Daddy --
What did you hear?
But what?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
I thought the subject was sex?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney?  They have such passion -- such savage emotion.  They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other.  Not really.
Something like that.
Why?
... Okay...
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
I'm not leaving you. I took self defense
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Yes.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay.  You are okay, aren't you?
How did you?...
Now then, Johnny-O; pay me.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
But you're the more intelligent one.
I have no idea.
And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds!
They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back...
No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone?
Have you got a pencil?
What? Oh, yes, certainly.
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky.  You're so funny.
Probably not.
...just some stuff.  A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie?
If your father were here...
I'm sorry, Mitch.
Sure. One of the richest men in America until he died a few days ago.
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
I'm not your pupil.  I was, but I'm not.
I can't take this anymore.
Don't forget, the day will come when you will have to face Razinin.
I must be stern with you.
You've done it again and I am responsible. How can you forget yourselves this way? You were sent here to make money, not to spend it.
But, Comrades...
<u>Heart attacks happen</u>.
For what?
I got to get downstairs.  The C.I.A., they want to see your body.
Tell me about it.
Let's go.
Thank you, Dad.
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number.  I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
Why not?
Yes. You'll have a great story, won't you?
Is that the Walls of Jericho going up?
Thank you.  Am I going to see you in New York?
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Yeah, four years ago.  They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people.  I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock.  Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed.  So they fire me.
Just like that?
Yup.  So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
You mean my championship trophy?  My bad.
How's that been?
It's better.  Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money.  I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
Miles?
What are you scared of?
You're right about me. I am worthless. I am nothing. I don't deserve to live.
I don't blame them for betraying me. I don't blame Rex, or Howard or my father. You see, Miles, I'm going to tell you something about me. Something you may or may not know. I suck!
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma.  Has it ever worked before?
Would you like to stay for dinner?  There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Oh yes you will wear garters—
And you could care less --
These are such horrible pictures. They're so grainy... they make me look like...
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
You know how to waltz??
I have a proposal for you.
Hi.  Can I come in?
And you--
I know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again.
What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this?
Afraid I'd give Mitch.
Afraid you'd take Mitch?
Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love.
I don't understand.
No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned.
Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.
She already has a daughter.
Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.
Nothing to speak of. What is this--third degree?
Keep your eyes on the ball, Mister.
I don't want to waste your time.
Where do you think I might find Maurice?
What do you mean?
What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
You're kidding.
And was he in distress when you opened the door?  Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
When... I’m told he came here...
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn’t want anyone to interfere with his ‘Art’!  Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Stop kidding.  I want to know what happened.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Aaron, will you tell me?
Then what was good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
You said 'whoopsidaisies.'
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit!  This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way...  You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen!  Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
Isn't it like, obvious?
Equitation.
No.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Give it yourself.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
I know that. I can't tell you how many times I've said that to myself in those exact words.
I have the potential to smack the crap out of you if you don't get out of my way.
Oh, right.  Friday.
Like where?  The 7-Eleven on Burnside? Do you even know my name, screwboy?
Liverpool?
..."The Devil?"...
Yes...
Okay, I do. Get back up here.
You can't back out on me now.  We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I hope so.
I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place?  Children are very impressionable, you know.
Packing.
Why?
Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning.  This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
What a great kite.
Good.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
What happened with Rick?
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes?
I have a bad feeling about this.
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
That's boring!
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
Mandella, eat.  Starving yourself is a very slow way to die.
I warn you, I can yell awfully loud.
And no birds sing.
Do you hear anything?
No, thank you.
Somewhere in here I was born... and here I died and it was only a moment for you... you took no notice...
No.
I'd better get back now.
Just checking up on your family.  I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Did he mention it?
Are mom and dad here?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
They hid my car--
I've heard that one before, too. I remind you of someone you used to be madly in love with, but she ditched you for another guy, and you've been carrying the torch ever since, and then you saw me and something clicked.  Huh!
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
I'm still listening.
And glow happily ever after.
You should have more self-control. You were in the army.
So what are we gonna do about this?
Certainly, of birds.
It's an uprising.
It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now.  I think I've got it all figured out, by the way.
Oh, Elliot!
Oh, what, in this section of town?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
Protect life... Until death.
Oh, yeah.  So we split it. You know, as in “share.” People do that.
Jeffrey knows love like he knows macramé.
And you?  Why did you lie?  You promised I could be confessed...
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be.  Maybe it’s there with...
Hello there. How’s the flat. I cleaned...
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I came to feed your fish. I didn’t know...
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
Well, I’m sorry. I...  This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I’ve got the week off and he’s come to stay.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
He's with his dying mother!
No more he's not.
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
I didn't think you could come with the party and everything.
Why there she is!  Of course she's home.  Stupid of me . . .
Syevodnya
That's what I'm here for--to get out! I want to get away from here, from you--as fast as I can and as far as a hundred thousand francs will take me.  Sixty-five, ninety-four--
Thirty-five to the left--sixty- three, eight ... I wouldn't fall for another man if he were the biggest crook on earth ... Seventy-six, eighty-four, fifty-five--  What has she got that I haven't got?
What time is your rendezvous?
Yeah, I've had it forever.  I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well...  I'm not the answer for you.
You know what? I...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
It is. I did it cooking.
It's nothing. I burnt myself.
Yes.
That's right.  And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby.  Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
My pleasure.
Really?  Okay!
Neat. Goodnight!
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Give it back to me.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too?  What happens, Eddie?
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Hi, Bob.
Yes, but...  He was having an affair.
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Tomorrow morning.
We decided...
I'm not exactly having fun, either... Steady.
His name is Skipper, Dad... Steady.
Quiet today?
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
Right on! It wouldn't be a celebration without it.
Well, they're my species.
Yes. They're old friends.
I don't know. Perhaps.
We <u>are</u> alone - you and me and everybody. But we can look at those stars and maybe someone down the beach or across the sea in China is looking at them, too. Someone we don't know and most likely will never see - that someone is breathing along with us. And the star- gazers of the past - from peasant to princes - and the star-gazers of the future - all of us breathing and looking up there. We are alone - but look at the stars and never feel lonely.
No.  We decided that we're friends.  I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
No, it isn't. I'm hungry and—and scared.
Not if you're more hungry than scared.
Well, I am.
I can't forget it. I'm still hungry.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
Thank you very much.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Maybe I should come back another time.
For bringing you here. Come on, tell!
Yeah.
Waiter!
Probably.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
Let me go, let me go, you creeps...
My name's, Penny!  But who cares?
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
Well, where is it? I-
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, you do?
I want to watch.
Of course you can.
What're you talkin' about? That's your son in there.
Really, Sail, I'll be okay.
How can you say that, Sailor?
Was he a good detective?
Why, are you famous?
Yes, I know.
Must be quite a pal, risk his own ass like this.
So, what's <u>your</u> name?  It'll be in the paper tomorrow anyway.
Buddy.  That's his given name?
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
Six years.
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
What?
This is a Lifestyles hotel.
"Gritty"?  Is this gonna be one of those youth hostel dives jammed with backpackers who don't believe in deodorant?
It's called... the Gritty Palace.
Umm, where do you want this?
Looks like we're not going to get a chance to get much done.
Moselle Miller?
I'm looking for Maurice.
That's not Maurice?
Of course I do. What do you mean—
Kool-Aid!? But who'd would want to -
No, I was just... How you doing?
Oh. How come?
"Banners?"
They're fine... you miss it?
I'm fine.  Have you seen Peter?
Larry, you've got to tell her.
Larry!  What are you doing here?  Mom sent you.
Don't bet on it. Last time I had a pap smear the guy needed leather gloves and an oyster shucker.
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Mom!
I have a note.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I'm excused.
How do you feel?
Mom!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Is everything okay?
I think if you're honest with yourself, you'll admit you've had a chance at a number of Amana appliances in your lifetime.
It's a metaphor.  It's women who always think there's some unknown out there that's going to be better than what's in front of them.  And instead wind up with nothing.
Was it him or you?
Is this a joke?
I think what you did was...
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
All right.
Nothing.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
Someone from another world--so entirely different. One gets so tired of one's own class--princes and counts and dukes and kings--ah! And everybody talking shop--always trying to sell jewelry ... And then I heard your name and found you were just one of us.
You know, when I first saw you, I thought you were an American.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
He's not saying that!  He's saying don't volunteer!
That's right!
No!  I don't want you to go to the police!  There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Dew yew hayuv ah-dentifikyshun?
I mean, what is it?  Another Secretary? A jaunt to the Bahamas with Some 'campaign worker.'  Where is he?
That was quite a thing you did today.
Oh, I don't think so.  Still, you helped a lot of people.
Au contraire, mon cher.
To the stars.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
Lyla's very nice.
It's only four days.
I can't.
...Screw you.
Please don't go.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
How am I a hypocrite?
Jude, you okay?
Lydia?!  Lydia who!?
Can I have my desk please.
You don't know the half of it.
It's the same image - Kong!
I have been patient and I've tried to help, but you wouldn't even let me do that.
It takes so many things to make love last. Most of all it takes respect. And I can't live with a man I don't respect!
Ted!
I just don't want to go over it any more.
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Okay.
I thought I was very charming, Stewart.
Well, you never will again!  Thanks to Vitamin C! I'm reading a book that says the foundation of a sound body structure is one thousand milligrams of Vitamin C every day.
Did you write that column?
How do you know him?
I knocked several times.
Sorry. Must have been day-dreaming.
Well, everything's set. Creating quite a furor, too. Great stunt King's going to pull.
Stunt?
Landing on the lawn in an autogyro.
Oh, yes. I heard.
Yes. Personally, I think it's silly, too.
What's the matter, Ellie? What's wrong?
As opposed to twenty angry women?
No kidding.  I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
Oh, that's all right, Stew. Forget it. As far as she's concerned, I'm just part of the hired help.
It's true. It's true.
Shhhhh!
Okay.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do.  Are you happily married?
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions.  I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
You're late.
I've fallen in love.
I'm married.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
Thank you so much. Good night.
He recognized you!
So, tell me, how’s unmarried life?
So you washed it off!
You may go, Smythe.
You see, like you and I...
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
No, I'm not.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night.  You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods.  Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
We did it.
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley— and any minute... .  ...I'm frightened— I'm frightened.
I'm sorry. Where were we?
Have you been taking your digestive enzymes?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care.
Annie. Annie Hayworth.
Why...
To see a friend of mine.  Will you please be careful?
To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
Didn't you see the lovebirds?
No, almost never.
Uh-huh... So, what'd you talk about?
Oh, my gosh, everything! My trip out here, what we've both been doing, you know...
This isn't fair, you know. Do you always get what you want?
Enjoy your Kenworth.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
You first.
Ringing my bell...
Your <u>war</u> <u>record</u>? You're the only one keeping that alive. For everyone else it's ancient history.
It's the truth. What's hurt you the most is your record since the war. Different cities, different jobs, and not one of them shows you can accept any real responsibility.
It's too late, Ted. When I get back to Chicago, I'm going to start my life all over again. I'm sorry.
"Make the shot."
"Never say die."
What was that?
Basically, yeah.
What?
You know what's nice about you? You just seem happy being yourself. You don't try to act cool.
You go see agents -- or Equity calls, open casting calls. And ad agencies -- commercials -- you don't get work, you just go around.
Can't break tradition. It's bad luck.
You have something in mind?
Surgically attached.
No. You'll see when we get inside.
Jesus.  They look like the Secret Service.
Yeah, I heard that one before.
What?
It sure could, yeah.  Thanks a lot.
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Now what are you doing?
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
I hate chickens.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I don't want a steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
I hate boats.
Ezra, I'm lots better than you're used to. Tell me -- the other night, watching me with Mr. Faber -- wasn't your tongue a little bit hanging out?
Oh, don't be a doo-doo.
Enzo!
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
To see your father?
Well!  What do you want me to do - applaud?
Where is it?  He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
I do not know how to undress a man.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck.  I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
I know it pains.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Catherine, my sister...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
But where are you going to be?
What about you?
What?
No.  Did he really?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
No. I just thought... forget it.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
You got everything you need?
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
I think we ought to walk.
I'll take it.  What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Your heart.
Oh, get off that trapeze!  There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I know, but --
I'd like to think.
Good.
And do what... rot away in a room?  We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I don't believe so.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter.  It was a form of temporary insanity.  But I had to tell you about it because --
What?
All girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.
I can't eat before a game.
Taste this.
So I hear. Is that all?
One more minute.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Yes, yes, I did.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
Stop it.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Frustrating.  Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Peter, are you okay?
No.
That's the guy you've been waiting for all these years?
Is Damon Bradley here?
Right now?
That's really nice!
What?
Okay, he's on base.  Can we talk about my life now?  -- Ike's going to turn that tattoo stuff into a big deal -- that I was never serious about Gill, blah blah.  He's totally out to get me.
For what reason?  Some personal satisfaction?
Would you?  Really?  Wow.  I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Sorry, old man. Work.
He is not!
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
I can get home all right from here—
It's probably because you got him fired.
I'm going down to my cabin. I have to send a wireless-- see you later.
Yes, sir.
It's not that simple.  It costs money to do this at home.
No.  Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself.  Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
My son.
After that, who cares?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife.  Look!
And if I don't?
It is broad day!  The rooster tells us so!
Mr. Henslowe?
Oh dear.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That’s when he hit me, and told me he’d killed my brother... “You don’t know what you’ve done,” he said.  “We’re in deep trouble,” he said. “We,” he said. “We.”  We’d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn’t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Yeah, and I noticed the only part of you featured in your big Kmart spread was your elbow.  Tough break.
Just a few more minutes, then we can go.  Take her, will you?
She lived on the plume.  You never know.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Right, right...  Okay..  You don't think he's gonna think I'm too aggressive?
Faith.  So far you've trailed the man halfway around the globe.  At this point, I don't think another fifteen feet is gonna tip the scales.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
She's seen everything before.
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah... Well...
...of course you do.  You don't remember me?
But I'm the one who's sorry. Letting you go was the biggest mistake of my life.  We were thirteen days away from getting married and... I just got scared. It's a mistake I've had to live with for six years. But it's behind me now...  And I hope you can put it behind you. I've missed you... David.
We were engaged.
The day I left you I just drove and drove. I drove all day and all that night, and I didn't go anywhere. I just kept driving. I stopped at a little country church, and the pastor let me in, and I sat --
No.
Thank you very much.  Aren't you a gentleman?  Mr. ...
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
Sure --
Sorry.  Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Who's that?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis.  You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
You're right.  I must've made a mistake.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're—
Terry, for God's sake.
Terry, you're bleeding.
Never closed my eyes.
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Stop it!  What are you doing?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Because... because you just can't!
Let's go from both ends. We'll cut him off.
Well, they are French.
China will think it happened before midnight. Britain will swear it happened after midnight...
Famished.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Look, everything's going your way.
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
What do you think my friends would say if they found me in a little cheap flat?
Why do you need my finger?
Correct me if I am wrong... We are facing north, aren't we?
No... I am looking for the Eiffel Tower.
I am interested in the Eiffel Tower from a technical standpoint.
How long does it take a man to land?
Darn clever, these Armenians.
Okay. The woman just can’t walk away...  I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can’t you go to your Embassy?
You don’t know why he’s come to Los Angeles?  The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
No, I mean, if it's fine with you, I'll, you know, be your date.
I don't know. We were planning on seeing the Astrodome.
I <u>can't</u> call an exterminator.  I can't afford one.  God, I can't even afford my <u>phone</u>.  I got fired.
So did I.
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Your Majesty.
Drugs? God, no! I'm totally against drugs.
I have no idea what he was mixed up in... it was always something.
...well, if you're not going to slit my throat, why'd you come up here?
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
-- Is what?
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Woman friends, too?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You must get lonely at times.
So what happened?
I'll not denounce you.
What is the matter?
That's a silly joke.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Oh --
Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Hi, I'm Betty. I'll take a Miller, if you got it...
He's a prick. Merle?... You're a prick.
So you're into "Reason," too? Finally, someone civilized! I'm Ellen, what can I get you?
This is the person...you were talking about?
Must be a spare set.
Was it Foley?
How's it going?
Ray's with the F.B.I. Task Force, working on the prison break.
Thank God! What a relief! I thought... After you disappeared... I couldn't find you... I thought all sorts of horrible things...
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's the *father*! He's her baby's father!
Hi.
You don't understand! It's her father...
Yeah, well... It's finally over.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
The aliens...In the mother ship.  You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Oh, tell the story.
What's that supposed to mean?
No I'm not.
Yeah, Steve. Steve was all right for awhile.
I don't know, it was complicated. He's in San Francisco, I'm in Miami.  Besides, Magda's psychic dog hated him.
Mmm, nice dress? Or mmm--  Gorgeous, I was insane to let you go!
I don’t do naked. My sister? She does naked.
Yes. Tell that man to drive slowly.
Tell that man not to drive so fast.
Bring me something simple. I never think about food.
The future of the common people.
Nature made him then broke the mold.
I'll check.  I have it on powerbook, these days.
We danced to it.  Just like this.
The night we met.
No.  Well all right. But you want to and I want you to and we both know it and all right.
I'm sure he'll be sorry to hear that.  Who should I tell him called?
What?
What are we playing for?
I love you, Walter.  Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Kiss my booty.
Well, fine, fine.  Fiddle da dee.  And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Chris -- Chris -- !
What are you going to do?
How about if I try humility.
It's sold.
Of course, that's what friends are for.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Quite a few.
Change my name.
No you can't.
I was never built for these moonlight strolls.  Why did we have to leave the bus?
Poor old Shapeley. You shouldn't have frightened him like that.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
Not as long as I'm alive.
...I suppose.
Without oxygen...
We think so.
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
That is a <u>nasty</u> story!
You've been pitching out of the wrong side of your brain.  These'll help move things to the right side.
They did when they were in the Carolina League.
So how's Norman?
Don't you have anything to say to me?
You don't change, do you, Bill?
He said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.
I'm sorry.
What?
She's alive?
She's alive!! She is not dead?
The boss is getting hoarse.
What?
What are you talking about?
...Screw you, yoyo.
Umm, I don't think that...
I am?
It was Beth's idea.
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Be careful.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Where are you staying while you're here?
That's the rub.
Not at all.
Lemon?
One more time.
Show me again.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Yes, on the floor.
How are you?
And here I thought my mother was...
Boy. Boy, oh boy.
She held that against you?
She didn't love you?
And your mother was very beautiful. She must be proud of you.
Oh right. You met Patricia.
You felt obliged to.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
May I?
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Somebody's mother.
Best everything, Joe.  But I'm going to dance with you.
Nice meeting you, too, Walt.
And--
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
No, I mean you can do it from the cockpit.
You can do it from up here, Captain.
Aren't we a little old for that?
Why, that's ridiculous! I was on that bus—I told them to wait!
Where's the bus to New York?
No, she wasn't my sister.
Ssh!
Just a second, Mike ---  Mollie, I got it!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
What, Howard?
I can't sing it anymore.
That song.  I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Yes.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
I will!  But I need help!
You tell him. When you're able.
It's not Charlie. It's me.
Well, see you at the Berlin Express.
You never said you wanted one.
Forget it. It was... fun.
Hello ... Is this the Spanish consulate? This is Doña Ignacio Fernandez.  My husband and I are leaving tonight for Berlin ... Is it too late to get a visa this afternoon ... ? Thank you, thank you.  How long will it take you?
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor.  I am sorry, Will.
Nobody knew!
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man.  You are that man, Peter.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah.
it's my first time.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
Did it hurt a lot?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
<u>Grossartig</u>--<u>kolossal</u>!
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Really -- don't do that -- I'm sure this is not his job.
Yeah.
A surprise, he said.
Shit.
You too.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
I can handle it!
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden.  Unless you trick him.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
I just want to know, that's all.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
Simon, why has he become so... so...
In one minute.  You are going to feel so foolish.
I don't understand.
Mona?
I got it done.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
But if it's sickening for you --
Thank you.
May I stay then?
So, you've had a little bad luck.
Your letter came yesterday.
I just thought if I gave you a drink and fed you some dinner, you'd be so grateful you'd take me to a movie.
Course I did.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh?  And <u>you</u> fired <u>me</u>.  Jesus.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over.  I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
In braids? That's right.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
It's possible.  Why?
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
I don't have to say that.
Okay.  So I had this...thought, and...this may seem like it's out of left field, and I don't know if you can, but since I'm not going with anyone --
Not bad, Chris.
Yeah...so...you've got this sort of... Bobby McFerrin thing going there.
Okay.  I mean, I agree, but...aren't you supposed to be out, like, trying to decapitate someone with your lacrosse stick or something?
Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
Is that bad?
That's great!
Oh let's not...
It's Skip, for you.
There is so little I know. It is as though I were walking down a long corridor that once was mirrored, and fragments of mirror still hang there, dark and shadowy, reflecting a dark image of me... and yet not me... someone else, in other clothes, of another time, doing things I have never done... but still me... And I can't stop to ask why, I must keep on walking. At the and of the corridor there is nothing but darkness, and I know when I walk into the darkness, I'll die.  But I've never come to the and; I've always come back, before then. Except once.
That what's happening to you, only faster?
What are you talking about?
We're doing something -- ?
We were afraid.  Silence seemed better.  To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks.  Even though they should be.  They're about what people <u>believe</u> is true.
It seems human.  To me.
This is his fiancee.  Who's this?
Montana?
What?
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Plus some guys whose food I don't like.
Women are such fools!--Why do so many of us pass up <U>right</U> guys?
But it did. I was there. This old man said, "Man and wife."
You'd better be.
Tell me Mr. Massey. What was your performance about this afternoon?
Ruth says you've been too successful, that you're bored, complacent, and you're on your way down.
Did you see the tape?
See the tape. Then we can discuss my heart.
Other than my upchuck reflex? Nothing.
How do you know?
Unwelcome.
See the pull of a book like Twenty Chefs, is not who I put in.  It's who I leave out.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Well, no, we sort of skipped that part.
Honey -- later, okay?  Whoop.  Wait.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
... light.
Wait.  That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
We are?
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
No!
Well, I'd like to read them.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose.  But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
What are you doing?
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Mother!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Stay in him forever?
Which number do you want, George?
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
No.
Where are you going?
Jack!
There's nothing to say.
I don't think that'll happen.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
The mafia!  La Cosa Nostra!
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Where we going?
All right.
Is anything wrong?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
It's private.
I'll take a chance.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
It's ok. That's alright.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
I've got a hunch you're going to win that bet, Inspector.
Oh Joe, be happy for us. I'll pay you the twenty thousand.
No... tell me.
Then, tell me a story.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
Sarah Sorkin. Ramona Barcelona -- this is Miles Massey.
Hello Miles.
What <i>is</i> this place?
Well, actually, all whores worship the dollar, if you want to get technical.
That's terrible.
Scottie, why are we here?
But why? Why here?
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
Where?
In the knee?
Goodnight, Miles.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
So that's it --  You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
What guy?  Whose apartment is this, anyway?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
Pop!
Yes -- start in L.A. on Tuesday.
Yes...
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Go onto the next question.
Many things...
Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
Right.
Doesn't matter.  Doesn't make one bit of difference.  Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so <u>nothing</u>?
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Yes, I...
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I feel fine.
Macaulay.
I'm not worth it, Buckaroo! Forget me!
And up a dime.
Three bullets! Any good?
Of course I knew.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff.  It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's the pay?
Sure.
How was your game?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
Well, how about those old romantic movies with those great stars, huh? Like Audrey Hepburn.
Yeah...
Hey, how 'bout a card for me? What is that?  "Please call if you have any information on David Ravell." This is my phone number! How many of these have you given out?
How many men have I talked to?
Fuck the details, they're always to blame... Look, too many of these guys duck out on us, especially after they become doctors or lawyers. I see it at my company all day long! So I'm just gonna make sure you get your, you know, fairy tale ending or whatever...  One of us should.
...so, we'll hit the library first and fan out from there. They've got all the L.A. phone books, plus medical directories...  We're not gonna let him hide from you any more, okay? I'm making this my personal mission.
David isn't hiding from me, I left him standing at the altar six years ago and now I'm...
No, no! Well, see, she was having an affair with a Russian diplomat who I believe was mixed up with the Mafia...
Jesus, I thought my love life was crazy...
It may not have been an accident. They never did find her head...
Her 'head'?! You're making this up...
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
It's okay sweetheart.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
Eyes on the road.
I'll be fine.
So tell me about yourself.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Thank you.
I have so much to tell you.
But you could get killed, right?
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Yeah.
Jesus!!!
You know, you're not a bad driver.
They're all right, aren't they?
Your color.
But it's not enough!
<u>This</u> <u>woman</u> <u>has</u> <u>more</u> <u>than</u> <u>jewelry</u>.
Did you ever take a good look at her--uh--
But Roki said--
What?  Beth?  My Beth?
I will.  Bye.
I'm off. There's food in the fridge.
Listen, if you get too anxious, call me at the hospital, okay?
I've left those pills for you.
It's silly of you to be apprehensive.
David, do you want me to stay here tonight?
Dad?
Go away!
Now, I'm getting interested.  I want to know more ---
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
Hm.
Please!  And what happens after tomorrow?
More than you think.
What's tomorrow?
What are you going to do? Now that you've quit the police force?
How long have you worked here?
Like disposing of their wives?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor.  But hunh-uh.  Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
The chromium.  Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
What's chromium?
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
You bet.  Paid for a check-up for the whole family.  And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either.  They just took care of it.  Just like that.  We never even saw a bill.
Wow.  Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
Whose number do you need?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay?  I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it?  There are no holes in my research.
Hey -- those are my files --
No.
I said, <u>whose number do you need</u>?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs.  Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it.  Right now. Hurry up...
Which ones?
Huh-huh.
Yes.
He was trying to kill you, right!
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And that's a bad thing?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
I don't know.  In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Y-yeah.
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Lynette, where's Sid?
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick?  I mean, Elliot.
It'll ruin everything.
Don't, don't, don't...
Nice to meet you.
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Great movie. Action-packed!
What?... Oh baby...
Hi.
Sonny kicks ass.
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
And that's it?
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Okay.  What the hell?  You got a deal. Get in.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
When? Tonight?
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes.  What about your own book?
I was repairing the stairs.  I found a library and the books were very useful.
My period.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Started what?
Where are you taking me?
You'll have a corpse on your hands! That what You'll have. I won't eat a thing while I'm on this boat.
In that event, we won't need so many supplies.
What do you expect to accomplish by all this? I'm already married!
I'm tired of playing overseas.  Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
Can I use your telephone? I want to talk to New York.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
There it is... Thursday... you can't rip it out of the week....
It's dead.
No music.
No, no news. We don't want to know what's happening in the world. We want to be left alone, don't we?
Well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...
Michael!!
That's a nice shirt.
Well, I did.  And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
You don't have to do this. I can look after myself.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
Yeah.  Sure.  Why not.  Call me at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
You asshole!  I can't believe what a --!
Somebody always does.
Somebody has to die.
I don't think your mother would like that.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
Come here a minute.
I mean, he loves his job.
No.
Is it morning yet?
I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered.
Yup!
Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater.
And you are?
Reporter?
Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you.
And what happens next in the dream?
Have you known him long?
Come on, it's not so bad.
I'm sorry. I just assumed. Your accent maybe. Where are you from?
I swear -- the both of you.  Some example you set.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
You like shrimp?  I like shrimp.
What's the matter?
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill...  Be my guest.
I'm sorry about the scroll, but sometimes you have to lose to win.
Yes, I had a husband and he was killed two weeks ago in my kitchen. I was right there...
Your husband?!
...this is your sweater, right?
I'm going back to... I need to... I don't know.
What are you doing?
You think I'm crazy, Rosa, but you don't know the half of it. My husband was, ahh...
What? No, I'm not gonna let you just run out of here... You need to talk about what's going on...
I have to leave now.
Where are you going?
Hi.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why later?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Where did you get that sweater?
I should leave.
You think I'd shoot you?
What're you now, a desperado?  Put the guns down.
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
No.
Don't look so uncomfortable, Lee--it interferes with your good looks. Give me a cigarette.  What did you do--persuade her to come on this voyage with you?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming.  Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I do not do it for others.  But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Of course I shall say what I have to say.  I always do.
I'm going to give her a wedding present.  Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it.  I can drop them on my way to...  That's funny....  Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
Did I hear a car?
All this, this is a woman's version of what you would like.
I'm sorry, Jack, but I can't shoot you.
I'll take chocolate.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
No thanks.
Nothing.
I dyed one and washed the other.
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Can we see it from the back yard?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth.  I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
What?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or— or human kindness in your whole body.
As in...
I'm sick of these calorie-countin' pansies. Give me a guy who likes kielbasa and beer and playing thirty- six holes and still has enough energy to take me and Warren out to a ballgame.
But here's the rub. The guy I'm talking about has got to be self- employed.
Sure I do, Earl.
Don't talk too loud.
Well, maybe you think I could!
I can make that in a lunch break!  Look, Hiram, you're sure it isn't just me? -- you decided you liked it, after all, the other night; you'll hang around for seconds?
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Here, Mom.  Drink this.  You know, you're awful.  You probably were flirting.
You did what?
I'll make you something.
We've eaten.
Spencer.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection...  Is this bothering you?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
How d'you mean?
Sixty four thousand, eight hundred.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
I can't trust you!
Don't turn on the lights, sugar.  I'll lead you around.
Why don't you get undressed.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
That's not an answer.
Tastes can change.
Not true.  Shall I tell you what you were thinking?  You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Junior.
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
I want you to wear these on the road trip when you pitch.
They'll fit snugly against your balls in such a wonderful way that you'll start seeing things differently--plus they'll remind you of me which is better than thinking about those nasty hitters.
Thanks, honey.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
Now I’m worried...just say it.  Whatever it is we’ll deal with it.
Okay...
Worse, you mean...
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
And now...?
...The people look like ants.
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
Because I try to be nice to people?
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All my clothes --
Wait. Where is he?
Who is he?
You have a brother?
Desperation?
-- why?
What would you do if you weren't an escort?
I don't understand.  What do you want from me?
Spontaneously combust?
Right.
-- gee...
-- go ahead.
Why is that?
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He's not the type to worry.
Where's that?
Some money.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
But it would hurt.
Don't call me stupid.
You mean this chocolate cake?
And your stomach?
Ask for trouble and you get it. Why there's a good boy in my neighborhood who went with a nice girl across the street for three years. Then he refused to marry her. Why? -- Because she only scored sixty-one on a Look Magazine marriage quiz!
No, I'm just going to head home.
-- Yesss?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
Good morning. What does this mean?
Very good.
Bobbie, what are you talking about?
Tell me about it.  L.A. is suffering from a wacko epidemic. And who knows where half the guys I pick up have been.  I mean, I use condoms.  Always.  And I get checked out once a month at the free clinic.  Not only am I better in the sack than an amateur, I'm probably safer.
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
I'm a housewife.
What is it, Anna?
Now, Ninotchka, you're exaggerating.
Well, sometimes they're not completely covered but... they don't freeze.
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
No, it's our house! Just tonight --  -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible.  Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
Who told you?
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
No, no jokes, I gotta pee.  Just tell me about your day.  What went on back there?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
It was a play.
I have expectations, too.
Maybe.
It's ok to ask that.
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
I have to help him!
I don't really feel like talking anymore.
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
My unfailing instinct tells me something's gone wrong with the stew.
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Foley's not going to make it.  And if he goes down, Glenn, you go with him.
Look, I can understand if you and Foley are close.
Wait.  <i>Have</i> you helped him, Glenn?  At this point, technically, I doubt you could be charged with aiding a fugitive. So you still have a choice.  You can help him and risk going down again, get cuffed and shackled, hope to God you pull a reasonable judge, not some hard-on.  Or, if you want to play it another way...
Thanks anyway.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
Like it? It's magnificent!  Not that it couldn't use a woman's touch. Especially around dinner time.
Why not?
So we'll sell the house.
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
No.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Yeah.  Poor guy.  Have anything to drink?
Are you--scared?
Thank you.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Oh, hey, Patrick.
It's freezing out.
Go ahead.
Your type will soon be extinct.
I have heard of the arrogant male in capitalistic society. It is having a superior earning power that makes you like that.
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
You don't like me?
What's wrong Miles? Did I spend too much?
Miles. I have a very good relationship with all the salesmen. I can return everything.
Miles? You're scaring me.
How many?
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Say you were wrong.
He's twenty-four now? A year older than you? And must be 'bout bald.
...are followin' him around.
The private eye cost Aunt Rootie over a thousand dollars? Then a little while later Dell ran off a third time to some place he said would "give him peace of mind." Nobody's seen him since.
It ain't so funny now, though. December before Christmas? Dell disappeared again and Aunt Rootie hired a private eye to find him. He was missin' for almost a month before he wandered back in the house on mornin' dressed in some filthy Santa Claus suit.
Too bad we all can't, baby... One thing about Dell?
When he was about seventeen, he startin' losin' his hair.
Well --  - they say he was very wise, so I'm sure he must have.
Yes, I believe he did.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
I felt like black.
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes -- oh!
For tonight.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
Yes. You see I have to plant my tree.
Well, it's not really mine. I dug it up in front of the courthouse. We're transplanting it. Letting it breathe, you know. But, of course, we would like to get it into soil, as soon as possible.
All right, then, and we'll be off.  Nice chatting with you.
Is he? Ah, the police. Always wanting to play games. Well, here goes.
The old double U-turn. Gets them every time.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
[Within] Juliet!
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Maxine! Listen:  It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Hello, Thomas.
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
Shut up.
Daniel.  Listen --
There is no letter. I made it up.
There is no letter.
There is no letter.
Very--
Let me go.
Rebecca Lawson.
I don't feel well.
Why?
A little after eleven.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
I assume his girlfriend.
I had some papers to pick up.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Hi Dad.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Yeah.
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
No, I don't "got it".  Even the farmboys back in Georgia come to the door when they're taking you on a date.
We will get that... we'll get everything... maybe a little bit later but we'll get it... We must be patient... Finally we got the spring, didn't we? We got the swallows, and you will get your apfel strudel too.
Now, comrades... there is something better in life than crumbs of French pastry.
He'll regret this.
Go by yourself then.  Where you taking me anyway?
I got a dress, yeah.
That's funny -- so am I.  What did you do with the cards?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Mind if I come in?
Are you all right?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
Sure.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
When?
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
Maybe we ought to leave.
When do you think they'll come?
That's repulsive.
Oh, you did? What am I expected to do—leap for joy?
Not yet!
That's an order!
Do as I say!
What do you believe in?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink?  Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
But you're not?
Is he cleaning house?
Where's Lother?
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Darling!
Sorry.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hi, Brad.
We have to.  I've got to be in New York on Thursday.
So I ask you when you're going to tell everyone, and you say...?
What time is it?
Honey?
Soft. I'll take the junkie otter, clearly! I'd let the little beast scratch and claw all he wants... Okay. Would you rather make love to the candied corpse of Phyllis Diller--
It's just a game...! Alright. Candied Diller, or... wear a hot pork vest across the desert with a fully digested crab apple in your mouth?
I told you.  Nothing --
What?
What were your parents like?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
Mr. Smith -  -- the "complimentary couch."
You don't sound like you're from here.
I came for love. My fiancé is here.
I'm not. I just drove in from Kansas.
So why'd you come to L.A.?
It's something I had to do. For David.
Well--I am Madame Colet.
I don't know how I could have lost it there.  I was nowhere near that niche.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
You stole my luggage? You--
I think he's been fired.
He's said some things over the past few weeks.  Look, this is why I came up with the idea of you offering him a job.
Sir, this is important! Haven't you ever in your life cut one corner, to make something important turn out right?
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
What're you saying?
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
It's got a nice ring to it. It sounds like a movie. "Clarence and Alabama Go to Cancoon". Don't 'cha think?
I don't feel very festive.
Maddy's party.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Straight ahead.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
Why not?
Okay we won't talk about it.
We'll pretend it never happened.
You don't want to talk about it.
I don't hate you.
She looks like a lot of other boats. I grant you she's beautiful.
That crack is burning a hole in your pocket.  There isn't even milk in the fridge.  The rent's due.  Now come on --
Hey, hey -- There's a rent.
You don't understand --
Farm Boy. Fill these with water --  --please.
Farm boy. Polish my horse's saddle. I want to see my face shining in it by morning.
Oh?
...and then she just breaks down.  And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently.  I mean...
Oooo.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I, I really like that.  I think that's a pretty color on you.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Let's stay for a while.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
Where we goin'?
Santos... What's happenin' here?
Santos... Where's J-J-Johnnie?
And jus when my baby's out on some Texas road with a killer.
Please Santos... Where's Johnnie?
Can't sleep?
I want to ride my own bike.
Okay.
Well, did you or didn't you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
Oh, Harold.
No.  Not yet.
Who was that?
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Thanks...  we're taking your cab.
For what?
Don't get dirty, Dad --
That's all?
'Be deliriously happy'.  I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
I'm sorry.  But give it to me again. The short version.
Really?
I don't want a goddamn cup of tea.  I want to go home.
How?
This is such a mess.  I come to you to protect myself against more crappy gossip and now I'm landed in it all over again.  For God's sake, I've got a boyfriend.
As far as they're concerned I do.  And now tomorrow there'll be pictures of you in every newspapers from here to Timbuktu.
You can stay calm -- it's the perfect situation for you -- minimum input, maximum publicity.  Everyone you ever bump into will know.  'Well done you -- you slept with that actress -- we've seen the pictures.'
Who knows, it may even help business. Buy a boring book about Egypt from the guy who screwed Anna Scott.
You wanna hear a nasty story of mine? It's kind of sexual.
How are you going to tell me what I have time for?  I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
You don't think so?
What do--?  You're being ridiculous.
Jackie --
Yes, that'd be nice.
Sure.
Well?
Jesus, Jack...
Hey look!
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
I'm impressed you can sew.
You sew very badly.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it.  Close your eyes.
Let's get you inside . . . .
Good—bye, Grandma.
What good can you do? Why are you being so fucking stupid?
I'm serious. There's nothing for you down there. It's dangerous.
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
Nice spot.
<u>I'm</u> dressed.
And good morning.
I couldn't arrive in New York at three in the morning. Everybody's in bed.
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I photographed it extensively, father.
Ted, we've only got ten minutes.
A "little white lie"?  A "little white lie"?
Oh yeah?
Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Hi.
I know.
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
I thought you were one of my friends.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
Just.
You married?
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride?  Maybe see a movie?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
What were you gonna do with me?
Me?
Based on what?  You never even see him.
Oh, no, no, no.  He's my sister's husband.  And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I couldn't swear to it, but I'm pretty sure he did.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
You can't leave us here.
But you're not.  You're somewhere else.  You're someone else --
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Found?  I'm not some charity case.
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
How was the game, honey?
Well, it's not going to work. So you'd better go.
He got hit by a bus.
THANK YOU.
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Who did you talk to?
That's exactly why I don't watch 'em anymore -- it's bullshit! Why the hell would an old lady go for a young kid?
You know, a mookalone, a schlep.
Then why you going out with him if he's a schlep?
Come on, Magda  It's like that movie Harold and Maude.
I don't watch the new ones.
He's no Steve Young.
What's he like?
I don't know. He's kind of a mook.
So she tells me three times a week.
People liked him.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
You need to.  She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
No...
Uh, uh, this is great.  I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Fine.  Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met.  It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick.  I mean...you learn so much.  Do you like Caravaggio?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin.  If you --
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Not if you don't want to.
It's so beautiful.
Nervous?  Um-hum. He smokes too much!
Now. Uh--mademoiselle--in the short time you have been M'sieu Laval's secretary, have you noticed any change in him?
Well--uh--yes and no.
Naturally not!
Yeah, we better.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get  news like this.  You're sure he's  okay?  Other than the  bump on the head?
I think  it's worse  now.
Dad...
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
Gee, um...  I...I don't know what to say.
The man dealing faro.  Who is he?
But I'm seeing him.
Thanks. And what are -
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Rufus?
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
My son is out there!
Mr. D. B. Norton!
You're going back?
You wanted to, or you are?
Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?
Look -- yes. I mean thanks, but -- don't you think we better be realistic?
Oh, you dear Atlantic Ocean--how you spread across the sea--From New York to dear old Europe--just for boats to ride on thee--
Yeah?
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Well, he has a straw hat--
He go back to the hotel?
I'm leaving, too.
I don't blame you!
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
Leave my sister alone.
Away.
Okay.
I don't want to wait for his call.
I would.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset.  Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What happened to you?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything!  You keep away from me!
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Scottie, please...!
Oh, no.
What'd you wish, George?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
If I told you it might not come true.
How do you think.
Kind of.
Art.
Why are you asking me all this?
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I think so.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Oh, you know what?  I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
He's fine.
Here, you guys.  Open them up.
Oh!
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Kristen got a quote?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
I need the job.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Bring me forty-five back.
Well, here are fifty francs.
Have you any money?
No, not a thing. Would you like to go out?
It's utterly beautiful.  I wish I could be creative.
I do?
Surprise -- is the most important element of attack.  And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
The same.
Yes...
I said, kneel!
Oh.  That's nice.
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I’ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it’ll be too late.
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Drive down the block.
Benjamin -- I really do.
I do.
Yes.
Okay.
How are you, Nick?
As long as Internal Affairs wants you to, I suppose.  Sit down, Nick.
I know it is -- but sit down anyway so we can get it over with, okay?
So -- how are things?
How is your -- personal life?
What's with you guys?
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
What is it?
Fun though, wasn't it?
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
Stew, your hands are shaking. You've been drinking again.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Alvy, I...
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
And what if I didn’t want you to...to do that to me?
That’s not true. We checked for leaks a few years back.  Good morning.
So you’re telling me. If something had happened last night...it would have cost me fourteen hundred dollars? That’s a down payment on a Ford Focus!
Chris, please.  Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
Chris, I had to.  I had to.  I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris --
Too young or too old?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Beautiful.
Eighteen.
Well, why don't you say it?
Mind if I use the bathroom?
I guess I do too.
I sometimes fade out.
You were going to get my door.
You splendid bastard...
Nothing to resolve, Ian.  Let's get a drink.
I am fine...  I gotta go.  Goodbye.
Yeah, I'm fine.  I'm off the phone.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no.  Not a good idea.
Yes, but how often?  Tell me, are You happy?
Glenn, I know your life history, who your friends are, where you've been and now, it looks like, where you're going.  Put your hands on the wheel.
You're not?
Do you feel good about it?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
Another one of those days, huh, nothing seems to go right?
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
You're political, then?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clichés and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
How'd it go?
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
About...
Tell me about it.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
125 West Ninth Street.
Okay, chief. What's my next assignment.
The name on the second floor rear mailbox reads Mr. And Mrs. Lars, that's L-A-R-S, Lars Thorwald.
All right -- but what's he doing now?
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Someone stole my stuff.
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
You know how it is, Dad.  He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You're a little touchy about it.
If I didn't have a fiancé in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't do that.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Yes.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Did he say why?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on.  Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and...  ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Last night?... There was no applause.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
There. Oh, I like the feel of soil, don't you? And the smell. It's the earth. "The earth is my body. My head is in the stars."  Who said that?
I suppose I did.  Well, farewell little tree. Grow up tall, and change, and fall to replenish the earth. Isn't it wonderful, Harold? All around us. Living things.
Haven't we met before?
Hello.
Oh, well. Must have been your brother.
I can't wait to meet you. Clarence told me all about you. He said you were his best friend. So, I guess that makes you my best friend, too.
You don't understand this guy.
Yes.  It's Asta's Christmas present.
So did we.  I mean, Sherlock here.
Okay.
And that is my last word on the matter.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
Does he love her?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Hello, Stew.
You mean I should speed up and try and lose them?
Let's get a drink.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil.  We're causing quite a scandal.
Okay -- but I'm going to spread some common sense on the bread. Lisa Fremont's loaded to her fingertips with love for you. I'll give you two words of advice. Marry her.
How's your leg?
When I married Myles, we were both maladjusted misfits. We still are. And we've loved every minute of it.
If you're making fun of me, I don't like it.
It pays.
Day jobs, yeah.  I've tried them.  Turn right.
They must have wonderful materials to make a thing like this so soft... something you don't even see.
You feel it, though.
Ninotchka, I wouldn't bring this up if we weren't such good friends.
No, my dear, it is true. That's how they live in the other world. Here we dress to have our bodies covered... to keep warm....
You know I told you that Pavlov and I are going to get married when he comes back from the maneuvers. Would it be asking too much...
You want this?
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road.  Keep me awake, willya?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy.  Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
I think the best part of marrying this guy is finding you.
You better.
Um, coffee.  If that's okay?
Right.
Virgins?
He's right.
Surprise me.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
... both.  Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
Ted!  What are you...?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
Please!
Put down the gun and I'll take your statement.  Okay?
You bit someone's nose off?
Crash, I didn't think you--
Oh, those motorcycles are awfully chilly.
Ever had a romance with a crook?
I think you'd better go.
My... visions...
What?
How?
Something like that
Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself.  Otherwise, what's the use?
How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
State trooper?
But you can't.
What I mean, when I say annoyingly perfect, is that there is nothing annoying about her perfection. It is vulnerable and endearing. And that is annoying as shit.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Mmm?
Is this in any way unclear?
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Wrong again--  But I dislike possessive women.
Okay.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
No, thanks.  I hope we won't be a burden to them.
At seven-thirty?
Really?  Huh.  He told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.
And she saved it.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Special effects?
I told you it was a long story.
Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
I don't think so.
No, please.  I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Almásy, who doesn't look up from his book.
So I see.
I'm so cold.
I do it because I love you.  Because everybody I loved you.  Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
They respect you.  Isn't that a kind of love?
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Oh, sorry.  With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
I will be the judge of that.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
You1re leaving, too?
Home.
Oh, they didn't brief you on that? How sloppy of them.
I was sorry to read about that thing in the papers.  And you've quit the force.  A permanent physical disability?
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
Welcome, Howard.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Hi, Dick. I'm Alabama Worley.
Clarence says we gotta be hittin' it.
God!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Stay out of this...  Doctor?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher.  She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
I'm a waitress.
No, I didn't.  So why are you h...
Huh?
Ted, we're taking off!
Am I supposed to not be freaked out right now? Because I am.
Only the elders.
How long have we known each other, Jerry?
See?  Wasn't that a lot easier than squealing tires and knocking over trash cans?
When I'm ready to compare notes, I'll let you know.
Jonas?
Agent Lowry.
Yeah.
It was just great!
No.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
You found him.  I don't know how to thank you.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar.  The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian.  Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room.  I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
I came to say goodbye.
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Don't tell me— don't tell me!
Told him what?
You... .
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's *Muddy*! Is it Muddy?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Honey, please.
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's.  You too, Drew.  We've still got some loose ends --
You're only six-five once.
No, I mean David Ravell. He's a surgeon.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
How'd you know that?
Thanks.
Well, it was nice meeting you, again.
By the way, what's your name?
I'll take Cathy up to bed.
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh, yeah.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
Oh, Westley, will you ever forgive me?
What are they?
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass.  But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady".  I'm a ballplayer, okay.  A ball player.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'd like to...
What will you say about us?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
This is yours...
We can.
Are you crazy?
Stifler told me.
Well...I needed to find you.  We are gonna have to practice that song.
Okay.
Hi...
....Hi.....
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Do you want to pick me up?
Ok.
Yeah.
Don't start --
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
But –
Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Yeah, and for yours.  I'm sure you've changed.
Oh, wow!  I don't want to have this conversation.  I didn't do anything wrong.
Someone else might call it stalking.  My dad felt it.  He started carrying a gun.
Back where?
Love at first sight?
Then tell me what happened.
Why?  What do these guys have to do with Ezekiel Walters?
I haven't felt like it.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Is what better?  Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob.  Is that really what's bothering you?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
I love you.
Dinner?  Again?
I just dropped in to have a little heart-to-heart talk with you.
What're you going to do?
--separate, in the evening..."
My hair's kind of a mess, isn't it?
...Aren't you skating?
And you never got the chance?
Oh, what, what do you do?
You made it.
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible.  I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I'm sick.
There are 18,250 nights in the next 50 years...
... and having "done the right thing" will only really be comforting, oh, maybe, five, six times.
I don't like it!
No, thank you.
A lie.  What do you hate most?
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
... I don't even want to talk about the luau.  What's this?
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
That's me.
You ever play one of these?
Amado.
He hates me.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
But I was with him the whole time.
He couldn't have.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
I'll just clear up here, and then dress.
Would you? I'd feel so much better.
I better go over and see her.
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
Ikset-kiba.  Me imanetaba oum dalat!
X...
It could help with a new car --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I don't make small talk --
The King of England.  I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Real genuine guy.
You miss her, huh?
Just what I said. That's what I --
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
You don't think either one of us could ever change?
How do you do?  I'm sorry we have to rush.
I thought you were an archer?
I also need someone who can read and write.
I just can't have any social life right now.
I just don't want it to get too heavy.  I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things.  But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling?  Do you know what I mean?
Friends with potential.
Be friends?
It'd cost you.
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
What?
Well, please excuse us!  We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What can I offer you, Eve?
What?
Don't you want to know my name?
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
What do you want, Nick?  Flowers? I'll send you some flowers.
Too complicated.
Why is she in a wheelchair?
Busy tomorrow?
Let me give you a little advice. When you embrace him, be sure to put on your gloves. It would be too bad if your fingerprints were found ...
Good-bye, Duff.
Then I suppose it was me. Get in, Harold.
Was that the one with the St. Christopher medal on the dashboard?
Hi.  I was worried I was early.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it.  Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Never mind about that...
For Pete's sake, Norville!
Where's my name?
Which?  The one in my throat.
No.  Laramie.  Except I was born in Cody. How did you know that?  Oh, right, sure, I forgot: you know everything.
The Netherlands.  Whew, that's a long way from Wyoming.
It's kinda hard this way.
The girl I remind you of.
I hardly knew the guy. Why be impolite to strangers?
I don't recall asking your permission.
Entry through the doors or vents triggers instant alarm.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
He'll need clothes... some money...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Leave me alone!!
Oh no?!?!?!
What brand'd she smoke?
Gee, Sailor. I'm sorry, honey. I never would have guessed it.
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
What if someone tries to steal it?
Oh--
What if I lose it?
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay.  Please, I have a headache, all right?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
No.  Not remotely.  I just want to find out about him.
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
... And those?
Judy Barton.
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Did you invite me here to score some cheap laughs.
You really think I engineered the whole thing. You think the marriage and the divorce was part of some scheme. You came here to celebrate because you think I'm without morality or soul. You --  sound like my mother.
Days??
I don't feel victorious Miles. I feel betrayed, abandoned and humiliated. I have pictures of him with another woman...
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
"Well worth the dig!"
Hi.
A woman has a favorite handbag -- it always hangs on her bedpost where she can get at it. Then she takes a trip and leaves it behind. Why?
But only her husband would know that.  And the jewelry! Women don't keep all their jewelry in a purse, all tangled, getting scratched and twisted up.
They do not! And they don't leave it behind them. A woman going anywhere but the hospital would always take makeup, perfume and jewelry.
Basic equipment. You don't leave it behind in your husband's drawer in your favorite handbag.
That Mrs. Thorwald left at six ayem yesterday with her husband?
What did they say?
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
No.
What?
Would you let me pass?
Don't do this.
No, you don't understand.  It's been wonderful meeting you.  But... I have a husband.  I have two kids at camp.  I have a life I have to go back to.
So...
No.  Course not.
So, sue me.  Things have changed.  I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Oh.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
MOVE IT, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING F...
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long.  Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
Be patient, Ted. No one expects you to get over this immediately.
You got a telegram from head­quarters today.
But it won't be. Not as long as you insist on living in the past!
Seven. Lieutenant Zipp died this morning. Ted, Doctor Sandler says you'll be out in a week. Isn't that wonderful?
It's a big building where the generals meet. But that's not important right now. They've cleared you of any blame for what happened on that raid. Isn't that good news?
Don't be silly...I'm old.  Don't look at me like that, please.  Why'd you come back?
Rosalie Testa!
It takes hours to get a drink around here.  There's only one waitress.
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
What happened?
I was right. you are Superman.
But he has nothing to do with it!
Giron...!
Edward, I can't.
I don't believe it!
I want my money.
I wouldn't worry too much about it, Stew. She'll see it your way.
Quite the little eccentric.
Is there a coup de grace in here, somewh...
What's next?
Endearingly absent-minded.
Waiter! Check, please!
Yes.
Why would I want to see you, of all people?
It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you...
I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up.
None of your business.  Am I still bleeding?
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
You pick it.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Ready for another?
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael.  Not once, not ever.  There's no half- way.  As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
She's a little jealous, I think. And confused when it comes to men...  So where are we going?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Does he ever talk about medicine? His patients, the hospital?
All the time. It's always "Loma Vista" this, "Loma Vista" that.
Sure did! And a funny thing, Betty, he introduced himself to me as George!
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Rosa, so you've met David?
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
What?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
So have I.  And I know you want to make things perfect for me.  And I understand that you really wouldn't tell me that until you were 100% comfortable with it.
Thank you.  I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Bullshit.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Now use it.
Yes.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
What are you doing?
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me.  I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents.  I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Yeah.  It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before --  Jerry?
Who's the Deputy Director of the F.B.I.?
You got me.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I *know* I do.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just *teasing* you? Do you think I *know* whether I want you or Wally?
What are you doing?
He never answers.
Because he put the lock on!  Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!?  I don't know anything, anymore!
I'm not listening.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
Ask away, sweet man.
Come sit beside me, sweet boy, and I'll draw you a map.
Follow the raven in her flight, Follow old black wing to the edge of night...
You'll need the fastest steed alive, for Couer de Noir's castle rests at the very edge of the earth.  Only the sharpest sword and the golden armor of Achilles will protect you from his fury.
You're not. Merely direct. What were you doing there? At Old Fort Point?
Big.  Frederick, show him the oils.
Do you like it?
I beg your pardon!
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty.  The Kirbys.
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
I'm fine. . . . . .  What  was I talking about?  Before?
That's because you're too far away, Stew.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Ramona! Don't get Mia Farrow on us.
Ruth Rabino.
She's a legend. Didn't she do Kravis or a Pearlman? She definitely did a Factor.
Neither did I until my lawyer found it -- quite a paper trail -- he had it in the dog's name.
In the words of my Private Investigator, we're going to nail his ass.
She did a Harriman.
Wow.
Hello Miles.
It's not something I wanted either.
Yes. I know. It's exactly how I felt when I realized you'd hired the goon to kill...
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Clockworks?
Siwash, huh?
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
It's not your fault, Rafe.  The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote.  It's just that -- I thought you were dead.  And now --
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Sure.  Does your daughter want to come inside?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
I think they call it a pasture.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
That would be just fine.  Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me.  No, this is a small one.  Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six.  Yes, a California plate.  No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office?  Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie.
I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right?
How soon?
No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you.
Immediately.  Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please?
Well... well, how soon would you want them?
Dad.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
The Criminal Courts Building.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Good morning, Madam.
That's the last of it.
Did you close the door?
They're dead.  Four out of five anyhow.  All in the last 24 hours. One car accident, two heart attacks and a stroke.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
Where did you find those?
Those are my letters!
You wanna dance?
And?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
Where?
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
I think I'll have a coffee.
That doesn't mean it was Rick's party.
Daddy!  Come on, a name.
You okay?  I'm closing.
Want to go to Butch's for a drink or something?
Okay.
Wedding.  Wedding.  You just have to get the rest of your ducks in a row.
Quick.  Very quick.
Hi, Peter.
Yes. Haven't you thought about it at all? Seems to me you could make some girl wonderfully happy.
Haven't you ever wanted to fall in love?
No harm in your coming to see us.
Won't I ever see you again?
Well, what do you know.
Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
What's up, Sidra.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
No.
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You ought to write these stories down.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll eat spinach but you'll wear garters too!
You wear them of course, silly.
I know that.
Darling, I don't care whether you can look Gallagher in the face or not, but you're gonna be a good boy and wear garters.
Oh, yes you will my dear - oh, yes you will my dear - you'll wear garters and you'll like it too!
That's what I mean.
I'm not going back to school.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
You have to meet Bess.
Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Did you bring along something to read?
Hey hey, what did you say Pat's last name was?
Healy.
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Roy! What are you doing here?
Then why did she object to you?
Because she was afraid.
And what had you done?
Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother.  Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all.
Then what was it?
Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.
With Lydia.  Did she seem a trifle distant?
A trifle.
Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it.
When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her.
So you're not so smart after all.  I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank.  In fact, I'd <i>rather</i> use a donor egg--  --<i>if</i> it came to it.
What happened?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Now you know why you’re here, Mr Lombard.  It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
No. And before you ask, no, he’s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
It was in the attic.  It was jus sitting there gathering dust.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Ask Al Auf. Almásy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
No, I don't belong here.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
Alright?
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
Eber's Deep Conditioner every two days. And I never, ever use a blowdryer without the diffuser attachment.
I counted on you to help my cause. You and that thug are obviously failing. Aren't we ever going on our date?
You're sweet.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
We're going to Jersey?
Can we go fly over Central Park?
"Mister Crowley, what's inside of your head..."
It's just carpet.
Hi-iii...
How old are you?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yeah.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
Only in bad weather.
I don't like them.
The oldest living things?
Of all the people who have been born... and have died... while the trees went on living.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah?  How's she doing?
Hi.  Where's Holly?
Are you there?
Will do.
The ring...
When'd you get in?
I'm fine, Kimmy. Fine.
You have.
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Good.
A week?
Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.
What's that?
How much does this cost?
Which part of the room is mine?
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta-  whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie.  Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God!  I don't even know where to put all my anger.
No you didn't.  But he did change. Just not enough.
Landon --
Right.  So we should've been able to cover more of them.
It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen...
Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over...
Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks...
Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. "Why should humans rule?" they asked themselves.
Why should we submit ourselves to their domination?
Yeah.
Yes.
I mean, it's jammed.  If we went... um...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Great.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Ow!
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Since you stood me up on prom night and vanished without saying a word?
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
I don't know.  It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He did.  Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough  -- and well...
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
It was on my bed when I came in.  Can you just...?
He didn't come!
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old.  Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
I know you think my job is strange.  You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye.
I'm going to miss you.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I want you to go back to the hotel now.  I'll call you a cab.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Sing it to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
You going out?
Johnny!
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded.
Let's get naked.
In a lake.
Yes, lovely. We've had a lot of nice weather lately.
Don't you talk to me like that, you little foul mouth degenerate!  Really, sir, I thought that you at least...
Benjamin, is this your first time?
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Are you afraid of me?
What did you do with the rest?
I can't! I haven't got it!
Hello ....  give me ....  Well ....  ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
I'll give it back to you ....  all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
You got it.
Hmm.
Well, you're married.
So what?
Yeah?
And don't ever try to see me again.
The boys at school don't think I am.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Oh, right.
Huh?
Don't be funny.
No.  Well, I don't know.  Well, maybe.  Later.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
Please!  You can't get mixed up in this.
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
When I'm good and ready.
Shake hands with your daddy.
You hungry? Pace and I ain't had dinner yet.
I'm sorry, Sailor. I just can't help it. Give me a minute and I'll quit.
For your breath.  You could use it. Squirt some in your mouth.
In my bag, in the car.
Oh -- Okay.
Yes--  It was on a Friday.  I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday.  It would be October twenty-eighth.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Horrible.  He was tired and pale.
Jackie Shawn.
That's George.
Well, don't they?
Huh?
He's got goodness, Mabel. Do you know what that is?
No - of course you don't. We've forgotten. We're too busy being smart-alecks.  Too busy in a crazy competition for nothing.
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
We lost him?...
I can't believe we came all this way and he's gone.
You gave it your best shot.  You tried.
Nobody here has any idea which way he went?
How long has he been dead?
No.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
That's it! That's the reason!
Where you been?
If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
Now what do we do?
That's going to cost.
Yes.
No accents today.
Did you watch it yet?
'Kay, good. Bye, then...
Hmm.  So, Del get that car he sold you up and running yet?
Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Sounds like you're very organized.
Keep your voice down.
Patience, Willow.
Divine ...
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Oh, sure.  Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Oh, it's a sad business.  My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Kate.
Time is running out.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Get the hell out of here.''!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Are you going to preach now?  Are we going to have a sermon?
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Why should you be the only one.
No!
No, well...I've been trying to write.
What 'business'?
My name's Sophia.
When did you start smoking?
What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...?
Well, there's got to be a way...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Nine hundred...
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
I'll give you a hint.  "Ohhh, yeah, yeah!"  Comprende?
I don't expect you'd understand.
Do as you wish with my body, you'll never possess my soul!
I see...
What will become of me then?
Need any company?
Want a blow job?
Prude.
Where are you going?
Are you sent by God?
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
We're friends.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
But my dear M'sieu Giron, I'm having a tea party. Must I be bothered with all these papers now?
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
That's the way he is.
What d'you mean?
Is he looking at us?
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Jacques!
Hi.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
If you have, it isn't too late. You know how I feel about him. But I want to make you happy. You gave me such a scare—I—when I couldn't find you.  You know, the old pump isn't what it used to be.
Oh, no.
You've been acting so strangely since you returned. I'm—I'm worried. I haven't bothered to ask you any questions—I—  Isn't all this what you wanted?  You haven't changed your mind about King, have you?
Nothing.
Sorry, Dad. I wouldn't hurt you for the world. You know that.
I haven't seen you cry since you were a baby. This must be serious.  Where'd you meet him?
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
How about both of us at the same time?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
Will you stop being silly, Stewart?
But I don't want to meet your gang.
Meaning, my friends aren't worthwhile, I suppose?
That's exactly what you mean. Heaven knows you've made that clear to me often enough. Well, I'm sick and tired of it. I've given you party after party - I've taken you to some of the best houses in this town - and introduced you to people of importance - and are you grateful? No! You insult them and act like a bore. I'm sick and tired of having to make excuses for you and the things that you've done. Perhaps it's just as well you're not coming tonight. Maybe I can enjoy myself for once without having to worry about you, and what you're going to do.
I don't know.
No!  Why would I want to kill him?
All right, but...
Didn't you forget something?
What's that?
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
Well, it's a living. But I'm excited about this.
No, not exactly. Want to see?
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Nope.
Is that legal?
Monday.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
No, I don't mind.
Wouldn't we all.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business.  Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Are you? When?
Let's just walk, okay?
I don't blame you.
It's Cecile.
I'm just commencing to enjoy this trip.
No, you can tell me straight.  It's okay.  Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Well!
And the rest of us are truck horses?
It relaxes me.
Well, have you ever made love high?
What?  Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
I can't... I just don't know how to...
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world?…she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke…Orsino.
An excellent beginning  Let him be…a duke. And your heroine?
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
Do you need a Tagamet?
These are yours.
What?
Hello. You all right?
Don't be silly. Can I get you something?
That's easy enough.
David, your dreams will stop. You'll leave England and your bad memories; and then this will all fade away.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Where does this go, Diane?
Do you practice here?
What kind of law?
Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars?
Only violators and practical jokers.
Ouch!
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
Exactly...
I didn't want to leave things the way we did.  Not this time.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
Really?
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
About a minute...?
What!?
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
It's bad isn't it?
If I...you know...
What's the matter? You look crazy.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No, Calvin.  Babies cry.
Look, I know you're mad.  But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them.  Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Pardon me?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
I am?
Wham... .
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot.  But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us?  We all know what the answers are.  We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family.  But what if that doesn't happen?  I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world.  But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Thank-you.  The real world.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Oh, you're both so naive.
It's quite—  –nice.
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
He went off someplace.
Why?
Then why are you shaking?
It's brand new. Revolutionary uplift. No shoulder straps, no back straps, but does everything a brassiere should do. It works on the principle of the cantilever bridge.
Yeah.
None of your business.
Give it to me— my Pop's job—
No.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
An aircraft engineer down the peninsula designed it. He worked it out in his spare time.
Go on to the next question.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating.  So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I like it!  So, doll, what about you lately?
I'll go.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter—and stick by it?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
Yeah.
Ok.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
You were brilliant today.
Hi.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies.  Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
This is Hildy Johnson...  Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats.  Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
I won't, I swear.
I told you before, you wouldn't understand.
No.
From basketball.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Hello, Bruce...
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
There are limits.
Sort of.
How'd your interview go?  I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I missed you.
Well, I'm going to make this a week you'll never forget.
What a day I've had!
Stop kidding. Wait a minute.
Step number two.
And just where are you from?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
What was he like, when he was little?
It will be okay.
I *know* this was right.
I was in his cabin--
Yes--and <U>very</U> popular--
No need for bells, Jack.  I'll nay enchant ye.
Were I a mortal girl, Jack, methinks I'd be in love with you.
Please, let's not stop, George.
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, there is.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant.  What I've gone through --
I sold them to you.
Tempting but... no, thank you.
You could always go with me.  I'm sure William has some friends.
The people at this school are so incredibly foul.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a $100,000.00 policy?
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
We're not interested.
I know that.  You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio.  On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967.  A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Four more.  Eleven people.  So far.
Floppy, huh?
I told you.  If he sees me here with another guy, he's gonna think I'm here with another guy.  I just don't want to send any confusing signals.
So what's in a name?  I wanna join him.  I don't see why we can't join him.
Sure you did.
I never even got to be single.
Because I'm the one who's single.
Well, how come we're always looking for guys for you?
Okay, okay.  You join him.  But first will you ask if he's here?
Not if you don't count the sixth grade.
What d'you mean?
I thought it was a pretty good beginning.
Do you want her to join us sometime?
Fine.  How's your back?
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
yeah.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
It's so nice.
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
So that was why she tried to run away.
We can't stay here!
Alright, I admit it, you had me there. You're better than most of them, anyway... do you have a headshot?
Well, David moved out here and started his residency. Then he met Leslie --
Are you sure you want to encourage this?  No, you're right, let's have some fun. So, what did happened next, "Betty"?
I can't believe I remembered that, although I suppose I should. I wrote it...  But that was seven years ago, and you're quoting it verbatim. I'm flattered... I think. Or frightened. What's your name?
I'm Lyla Branch. I'm the Producer.
Betty Sizemore. What do you mean you wrote it?
I married a car salesman.
No, no, no. We know all that. What happened with you?
You don't know habits, you think this is ugly.
No, I'm not.  Maybe you know him. Glenn Michaels?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
Thomas J?
That her?
Who are you spying on?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Cool.
That's one way of looking at it.
It's like a secret society.
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
But that would make me a slut.  Wouldn't it?
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
That's unlikely.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
Here -- take this instead.
What?
No wonder he let her go.
Nothing.  I was just making sure. So, who are you?
Seven o'clock, same as usual.
Certainly, but...
Yes, but...
Lovebirds, I see.
With... with Annie, of course.
Exactly.
Well, do you?
No!!  It's a wonder you couldn't get me something I can eat.
Raw?
What if nobody stops for us?
I hate the horrid stuff.
You're an expert, I suppose.
Tch, well, I sing!  For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.
No, I didn't, I, that's no.  No, I- I-I, no, I-I just...  hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know.  You know, you know how you take...
W-why?  You don't think it's realistic?
What?  You don't, don't be so sensitive.  Can't I say anything?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
I hope.
Yeah.  Well, maybe I'll get it.
Depends on the topic. My fenders don't really whip me into a verbal frenzy.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What? What have we done?
Oh my God.
Sorry.  I took a Benzedrine.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
How did you know this was my car?
We have.
Good-bye.
What?
No! No, thank you!
I couldn't mail it; I didn't know your address. But I had a landmark. I remembered Coit Tower and it led me straight to you.
No, you gave a very convincing performance.  And you'll be pleased to know that your eight-by-ten glossy is now on display at the local playhouse.
But you looked as if you liked it.
She *did* love him!  How many women have you known?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
You are very sure of yourself, aren't you?
I am interested only in the shortest distance between these two points. Must you flirt?
And where are we?
For my own information would you call your approach toward me typical of the local morale?
Suppress it.
Before you start picking your nose, I know he put you up to it.
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won’t be for a couple of hours.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
That's not even a scam.
But it's on the water.
Bullshit.  You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Oh, thank you.  We're in Jacksonville, aren't we?
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob — Charlie Brown.
As in <u>Catcher in the Rye</u>?
I've got a pretty good idea. You're here to kill me, so kill me. You want me to be afraid, but I'm not. I don't care who you are, or why you two killed my husband...
...I s'pose you did that so I could take my sweater off or something.
...I... I know what you are.
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
You really don't need anyone?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
Big Ringo fan.
And what do you do -- now?
No?
I don't care! We'd be together.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
You can't believe you've lost her!  Sooner or later, you'll find her, and you'll look in each other's eyes, and you'll see all that love...
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car.  Be right back.  Don't go anywhere.
What are these?
Only your body will remain.  I believe your soul will be at peace.  If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
There's water in your bathroom.
Hello?
Something like that.
Terrified. Still am.
When I was a girl my father took me to the edge of El Capitan. Three thousand feet of granite. Straight down. I was so scared my mouth was full of cotton. I couldn't talk, just stood there shivering...like this.
My father told me not to be afraid. He'd always be there for me.
He wasn't.
I had a lifeline. If I've got a lifeline, I'm okay.
No, thanks.  I'll just look around.
Cold is good!
What?
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Fine, she’s the kid’s dog.  Let’s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
You’re having a bad day, I’ll go with you...actually, there’s no way in hell you’re gettin’ me back out there...
Oh no. I’m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
No, I've got that, all right. But my money. All I have here is four dollars. I've got to get to New York with it.
I don't know what you're raving about, young man. And, furthermore, I'm not interested.
Oh, my heavens! It's gone!
What happened?
What am I going to do now?
I don't want someone who'll put up with him. I want someone who will enjoy him, the way I do. Do you know what he told my friend Tucker? He said he would've popped the question a lot earlier if Warren wasn't in my life.  Well he is in my life and I'm goddamn lucky to have him. The hell with Steve.
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
But she doesn't know, about her background.  She never heard of Carlotta Valdes.
Where is it?
Where is that?
This will do.
Raw carrots and beets.
You're distracting me. Go away.
Seven --  -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
You don't know him -
What do you know about classical music?
I see things.  My worst fears.  You need to know something, Peter.  I was possessed once.  Like Birdson.  It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Watch your leg, Dad.  I'm so tired of this.
Mom!
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter.  It's quite a formal name, isn't it?  One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What?
I was in Atlantic City with my family.  Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier.  I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care.  And then he held my hand.  I was scared.  All sorts of thing were going through my head.  But after a while I forgot about them.  At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his.  And I knew.
It wasn't a sign.  It was a coincidence.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Magic.
Magic.  It was magic.
What?
You know.
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Natural fear. Her grandmother went insane and took her own life. And the blood is in Madeleine.  Scottie, I ask you to watch her closely.
I'm home now.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
You still don't believe in God?
Never! I'll get to New York if I have to starve all the way.
You didn't give that boy all your money?
Why, haven't you—?
What do you mean—starvation?
To New York?
They go.
They go.
What are you talking about, Nick -- what's wrong with you?
I didn't know... I didn't...  It was so lovely... he was in my lap like... like a baby... and... I...
We started talking.  In fact, we talked until four in the morning.  We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests.  After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back.  Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
You and every person in this country.
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Please. Why not?
Through a window.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Whatever it is.
No, Faith.  They came out of somebody's imagination.
Yeah, well, Larry and his friends are hungry.  And I did say I'd try to pick something up.
You should write something about this.
So, what's your point?
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
What?
Okay.
What a wonderful philosophy. Thanks for being such a sweetheart. You could have been a real dick.
He needn't disturb you.
He won't disturb us then.  I think he's after morphine.  There's a war.  Where you come from becomes important.  And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Hello!  Good morning.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Excuse me?
I'll wait for your call.
It's a party.
In eye of that painting.
Hello.
No, it's a stupid privacy thing.  I always choose a cartoon character -- last time out, I was Mrs. Bambi.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You don't like it?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Gaston!
You remind me of my daddy, you know? Mama told me he liked skinny women whose breasts were just a bit too big for their bodies. He had a long nose, too, like theirs. Did I ever tell you how he died?
I'd stand by you, Sailor... through anything.
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York.
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it.
You're not going to notify my father, are you?
I didn't ask for your advice.
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
All right -- all right!
I'm coming!  Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Read it!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yeah.
Sorry.  Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little.  What did you say?
All set.
Who told them that?
Oh yes... very.
You know, my mother was a dancer, too. Her big shot was the touring company of 'Brigadoon.' She's been married three times. To a redneck, a poet and her tennis instructor.  See, I motor-mouth when I get nervous. I was nervous when I first got into the car. Now I'm scared shitless.
Yeah, Bandit II, Que pasa?
What's he...
There was a village square, a green with trees... and an old whitewashed Spanish church with a cloister. Across the green: a big, grey, wooden house with a porch and shutters and a balcony above... a small garden, and next to it, a livery stable... with old carriages lined up inside.
I didn't wake him. I don't want him to know...
Do you always have to repeat?
Thank God.
You must be new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you.  I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Oh yeah?
I'm a teacher.
She did?
I have a way with animals.
He's beautiful.
Oh yes. I forgot.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to.  That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
When I was here before I noticed a photograph of a woman on the desk in a wide silver frame. I thought what a waste of silver. That's all that interested me then. Now I would like to know... what happened to the woman?
No, I like the car.  By the way, though, about prom?  That was like a bad idea.  Sorry I invited you.
Let me go!  Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Take your paws off me!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
Ted, what's wrong?
Ted, you're overworked.  You've been flying yourself into the ground.
Let's relax tonight, just the two of us. I'll make a quiet Italian dinner just the way you like it, with spaghetti.
Have you ever heard of. Irony?
I never want to go through this again.
That's entirely understandable.
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Of course I wouldn't.
We're gonna go out tonight. Oh, that reminds me, I've got to call what's- his-face and cancel.
It was.  I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something.  You think I made a choice, of Danny over you.  I didn't.  I didn't have a choice.  I'm pregnant.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I just can't trust you anymore.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Yes, I guess I have.  I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous.  Besides, what difference does it make?  I'll never see Peter again.
Is that his name?
Yes. Peter Warne.
No, I'll go through with it.
But that's silly, child. Seeing how you feel, why—
It doesn't matter.  I don't want to stir up any more trouble. I've been doing it all my life. I've been such a burden to you—made your life so miserable—and mine, too. I'm tired, Dad. Tired of running around in circles. He's right, that's what I've been doing ever since I can remember.
Peter Warne!
Why? Do you know him?
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
What'd they look like?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
She was too young for him.
That's marriage.
I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague.  I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house.
I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH.  What is this? A Romeo and Julieta?
Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients.
I believe the residence will be part of the settlement.
You?  You think I don't get that? God, it's like just because I don't get drunk and barf every weekend, people say "Oh, here's this goody-two- shoes choir-girl priss."
Of course, I didn't --
Oh...well that's okay.  Cool.
Well the same things you do.  Hang out with friends and stuff, you know, whatever.  What do you think I do?
I think "shithead" really says it.
No. It's new and clean, and waiting.
I know.
I don't know. An open grave. I stand by the gravestone looking down into it. And it's my grave.
A grave...
No... it's in shadow.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
I'm pregnant.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
No.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Would they be good to eat?
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
Yeah, I did.
Steve?
I assume this is on Rex?
On what?
I may not sue.
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Happy for us... okay.  Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Call me later, hon.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Wait.  Did I just say "hon" to him?
Did he?  That's more than we get to do.
Just some In-Valid.  Vincent--  --somebody.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
No.
In the South Wing.
You bastard!
It's okay, my sweet.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
Why take the risk?
Two hundred dollars, please.
Such grace... and their smell; it's ambrosia.
We won the championship.
How much longer?
I am a princess.  You have no right to order me about.
Right here.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Here!
Let's go.
Oh, no. No. Our deal was for a month's vacation - with pay.
I don't know. I had to duck to get the story out. He was so far along he never even missed me.
Huh?
I'm okay.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
And you have to meet my father.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Do you... remember me?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
No, I... I never killed anyone!
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
No Juliet?!
Why?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
Thomas Kent!
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
So. Where are we sitting?
They weren't my shoes.  Mine were too small.
You were a tiger last night.
My father's.
No, that was restful. Again.
Thank you.
But one of your friends may be in need of you. You must answer.
The telephone is ringing.
Well...
Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
So? How'd it go last night?
What if you hide me?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in?  And we can hide there till morning.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know so. He's a taker.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
She shot you down.
Arlyn Page.
What is it with crack and transsexuals?
Yeah.  I saw one of 'em outside.
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
Thank you.  It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know.  And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy.  Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts.  All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
I'll say.  Holy moley.
I know.  They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease.  That's a kind of cancer --
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Are you kidding?  With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk.  I just kept all PG&E correspondence in one place.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG&E about it in the first place.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Yeah, I can see that.  I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you?  Right out loud so I can hear?  Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt?  Will you do that?
I got one on me at Lake Lanier. Lifeguard poured salt on it and it dropped off. Felt awful. He was a cute boy, though, so it was almost worth it.
Sailor? You expect me to believe a man'd be goin' around with a arm sewed to his nose?
Sailor Ripley! You stop! You're makin' this shit up and I ain't gonna sit for it!
Honey, we're goin' to bed now and it's time to change the subject.
We sure don't, honey...  Get me a Mounds?
Great.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.
No thank you.
Give it up.
What is it?
Thanks....
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I don't think I remember him.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Oh.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
That's nice.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
Thank you.
She's amazing.  She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
Yes, it's lame.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Are you scared?
-- But he does seem very nice.
Oh.
What are you looking for?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
The marble?
Oh. What's happening about the opera?
I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. That we're okay.
Food and supplies?  Who for?  Like starving people?
Why?!  Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
How long would you need me?
Well, I --
It's not his fault!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
I agree --
What's the way?
... Sally?
Those aren't mine.
Huh? Sure, look in my closet, take any dress you want!  We're still on for tonight, right?
Okay... oh, umm, would you mind if I borrowed some clothes?
Ummm... no, no. Different 'Ravell.'
You made it! Hey, that looks great on you. 'S classy...  So, how'd it go today? You find him?
What are you talking about? This bar is packed with professional people!  Everybody says if you're going to get married, this is the spot to meet someone... Luckily, I'm currently off men, so I've got the luxury of not giving a shit.
You know, the more I think about it, this really isn't David's kind of place.
He has a wife?!
I know what you mean, I recently had some trouble with a man, a different man... and David's still getting over Leslie.  His wife.
God, that's awful!
Had. She died in a car accident last year. She was decapitated.
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Are you in love with her?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mom's orders.
They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
I must talk to my brothers!
Comrades! Comrades!
Comrades! Good people of France!
Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
I report to the FBI, first thing they're gonna do is ask me to go get some coffee.
Huh?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Hey.
If you've never been out with him, how do you know you don't want to go out with him?
I don't understand any of that.
What was that all about?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I'll give you that.
Are you?
I'm still shaking.
Mark is a really nice boy...
When did they find her?
But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way...
She was selling birds.
You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch.
Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that.  She's very rich, isn't she?
She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she?
They're dead?
It's still available I hope?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the &quot;Dino Raphael&quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
My eighty, your twenty, smart guy--
Oh!
Want some Goobers?
Hey. There.
It's temporary.
Weird.  Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
Yeah.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Maybe I like garbage.
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG&E?
No.  Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said.  He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Peggy Sue!
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Thanks for reminding me.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Counts?
Why good?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Is it something you've done?
You're a government spook?
That's none of your business.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
And you promise to abide by it?
God help you, Lynette!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period.  I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
It's Kathryn.
I-I can do the job, sir.
A sawbuck!
Oh.
And you expect me to believe that?
You are well?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
I'm all right.
Why don't we take oxygen?
Oh, I think you can do it. Probably.
Let's just see how we do.
Let's do it again.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
No.
No.
Really.  She thinks he's here. Even though she's never met him. Even though she's never laid eyes on him.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing --  Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
I hoped there might be -- but no, I'm assured there aren't.
Good to know.
Okay.
Oh - I've found plums.  We have plums in the orchard.  We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
We have to send somebody over there immediately!  If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook.  There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
They're not open yet?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Not so far as I'm concerned, you're not.  Yes?
You can't tempt me.  Do you hear? I won't eat!
If Gandhi had a chef like Paul, it would change the whole political situation in India.
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yeah.  Basketball just, isn't fun anymore.  You know?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
What's he like?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just...  Take care, then.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
They belong to the people.
Czar Peter gave it to his wife, Catherine the Great. For it he sold ten thousand serfs in the market.
...they are the tears of Old Russia... see that stone?
It wouldn't be fair to the man in the street.  There they are... they are terrible things, those jewels....
Whew, at last.  Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
I love you, too.
No, I'm not.
Hi.
You're going to miss the train.
I know.
What's that?
Do I look okay?
Yes!  The notary is a phony.  He has the same signature as the contractor!
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
Really?
There were more flowers last year.  Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's.  Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows.  I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
I don't know yet.
Darling, of course I do!
I don't think so.  I have to get back to San Francisco.
I know.
I guess it does get a little hectic at times.
We need ice.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you know him?
I want to say something first.
The door's the only way out!
Don't be nervous.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out.  'Bye.
Beidermeyer?
Do you understand what I said?
We can't help it, we...we've gotta...
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Kevin, next year...with you in Ann Arbor, and me in Nashville...it's not gonna work, is it.
Yeah, the time went by so fast.
No, Kevin --  That's the whole thing, that's what I've been realizing.  That nothing's perfect, that you can't plan everything.
I know.  Let's go.  Don't you have something to tell your friends?
Nothing. Except he wasn't kidding. Usually it's a fakeout, you probably know. They pretend to tie you up, and you wear a dress with a cloth belt and they pretend to whip you or you --  Hell it's their money. I'll hang from the shower rod and whistle Maytime. Except this guy was really tripped out on it; he --
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet.  All right, open your eyes.
No I didn't.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
If you want me to.
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yeah.
They say the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated.
Horses.
Mr. MacDougal.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Music.
Mom, please?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Oh, how sweet.
What?
I did what I came to do.
I couldn't help it —— I loved him.
These guys are here to help you, Betty.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
You have an incredible memory.
What do I know about Williams?
Nobody told me.  I did see him!
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
Good.  I'd miss you.  You can get into trouble, though. You're not really a cop anymore.
You're not going to stop following me around now just because you're on leave -- are you?
No.  I wrote it years afterwards.
I'm getting deeper and deeper into my character.
Really?  It makes me sick.
Lost!
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
What do you want, Stan?
Then why did you ask me?
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Meaning?
Meaning these are the people you live amongst, you got a right to know if they're creeps. For instance, did you know there's a guy down the hall cheating on his wife?
You picked that up on the scanner. We gotta move.
I confirmed it on the scanner. I knew something was up because Puffy used to bark like hell whenever he saw him and you know Puffy only barks at bad people.
Have you been up all night again?
Bet your ass I have. It's an important job, Neighborhood Watch is.
Neighborhood Watch? Is that what you call listening in on stranger's phone conversations?
These ain't strangers, they're neighbors. This only picks up signals in a half-mile radius.
Magda, Puffy barks at everybody.
That's because there's a lot of bad people out there. Hey, Puffy tried to warn you about that Steve guy you was seeing -- he was a fucking asswipe -- but you had to find out for yourself, didn't you?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
What?
You think I should do Henry James instead?
Yeah.  I'll get some ice.
Yeah.
Sure.  Sure, uh, yes.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote?  It was great. She's really developed.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
It's on the table, Dad.
Oh, I don't know.  I guess it's just not quite the way I always thought it was going to be.  You know, like in the movies.
People have problems, insecurities, flaws-- and you have to learn to compromise, to overlook, to forgive.  It's not settling, Faith, it's life.  Real life.
Thank you, Tom.  I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I know, I know.  I do not want to move to Seattle.  But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think?  It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Now, Holly's not shy.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA  But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes.  He's all show!  Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know?  I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
Not for you.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What do you care?
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job.
When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Fuck Maxine.
Yes?
Oh, yes --
Good morning, my lord!
Oh Jesus.
Jos, that's not what we're --
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You did?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
Oh dear....easy honey...
His wife?
Hi.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
You missed a button.
Thank you.  They hated me.  I don't hate them.
Oh, Norville --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
I don't care what he thinks.
Nothing.
-- oh I thought you were --
How do you like my hair?
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Afraid? I should say not!
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it.  Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Would you like a drink?  I was just going to have one.
No.  Come in.
I'd like to ask you some, too.
A miracle. Well, that's news.
So.
No, I don't...NO.  I thought we were just friends.
I thought I was helping you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Yes, I'm pretty sure I would.
Okay.  Good.  See you then, then.
But I'm not finished yet----And your waves are so colossal--rocking boats both to and fro--Oh-h, Atlantic, how I love you ----how I love you--
I'm getting seasick--
Mr. Denby--What do you think I ought to do with that part?
Oh, Mr. Den-n-by!
I feel better now--I've got a riddle! When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of bean soup?
Since I stopped being able to get them on the phone. For a man who has nothing to do, you're certainly a busy little bee. Where do you go, these days?
Yeah.
What'd you put him in there for?
We'll never succeed -- we may as well die here.
You make me feel...
What? -- go on --
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ...  Dr. Bettes.
Not your name...  what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom...  He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better...  and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and...  you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
You're lying.  I'm not human.
But how is that possible, since he's been marauding twenty years and you only left me five years ago?
I'm so afraid...  ...you won't let it happen...
Don't call me that.
Hey, but did we get to you, Klute? A little?
Goodbye.
-- Us city folks? The sin, the glitter, the wickedness?
Why yes.
Rita Hayworth used to say -- 'they go to bed with Gilda -- they wake up with me.' Do you feel that?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
I think, before.
Aren't you happy?  Don't you feel proud...?  I feel proud and all I did was watch.
Okee-dokee, Doggie-Daddy.
I don't know.  What are they?
Phil Spector. Girl group stuff. You know, like "He's a Rebel".
What do you want here?
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
What's up?
I just don't want to go.
She will if you think she should.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
I wish, but it's full.  They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full.  What's going on here?
Do you know what you're going to do?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing.  I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Yes, Hi.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad.  Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Hi, uh.  Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Fine.
Jesus...
Where?
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Oh, yes, yes.
We really had a good time.
Um...Chris --
Do I have to?
Just enjoying my exhilarating first lacrosse experience.  You like, "kicked butt."
What's your middle name?
It's never too late to change. I used to belong to the petty bourgeoisie myself. My father and mother wanted me to stay and work on the farm, but I preferred the bayonet.
Don't do it, please.
You repeat yourself.
You don't have to do a thing. Chemically we are already quite sympathetic.
I acknowledge the existence of a natural impulse common to all.
I have a surprise for you.
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Hi.
Oh, he does that.  It's this silly game he plays. Half the people who know him call him George.
That's the truth--every single word!
... wrote it, yeah.  I'm the bad guy.
Yes...
...That's an awful long way to go, just to get some pussy.
You still got plenty energy for me, baby.
Sailor!
I'd got to the far end of the world for you, baby... You know I would.
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Better than I...
Chad Denby broadcasting--  --the nicest man I ever knew--
I was so crazy about him--anything he did or said was O.K. by me.  I introduced him to people--even after I knew his stock promoting was phoney and the card games were crooked. It didn't seem to matter--I didn't care--  --until he roped Ned in. Some confidence game--and the kid left his fingerprints on a drinking glass.
I don't have one. I don't believe in them.
Oh, I don't have one.
I just don't think we have one, unless it's in the glove compartment. Could you look, Harold?
About forty-five minutes, wouldn't you say, Harold? We were hoping to start sooner but, you see, it's rather hard to find a truck.
No, no. I just took it.
What letter?
What's that?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh!
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
Was it great?
It was okay.
Yes.
Yes... I am really nineteen.
So... one almost has to...
M'hm.
What difference does it make?
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just...  You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
Let me go.
It's not possible...
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
The nerve.
He wouldn't.
Gesture?
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Very clever.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later.  The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
Yeah, well, I check out today.
Hi, Barney!
Look I just wanted to say goodbye.
Yes.
Who... who are you...?
Hi, Plato!
Tomorrow is the full moon.
Well...
Believe me, Leon can't help you. He doesn't know anything about the jewels... I give you my word... I swear it.
Okay... Hold on...
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim  monument where Tybalt lies.
I'm so excited. Yay!
Such a beautiful view.
It's gorgeous.  Just my taste. I've never  gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked.  Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Oh?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Leave it where it is.
Where'd you say the showers—and things—were?
Thanks.
You needn't be concerned about me.
What?  The curse'll be lifted?  <u>Will</u> <u>you please</u>!
What do you think?
Yes -- I mean -- you never get anyone in 'Wings of a Dove' having the nerve to say 'inform the Pentagon that we need black star cover.'
The moron?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
What do you mean?
Look.
Over there by the courthouse.
That little tree. It's in trouble. Come on.
Look at it, Harold. It's suffocating. It's the smog. People can live with it, but it gives trees asthma. They can't breathe. See the leaves are all brown. Harold, we've got to do something about this life.
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
About Michael's job.
Is there an ashtray in here?
How are you, Benjamin?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Umm... yes. Back home.
Yes, ma'am.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
You said it was!
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
Motorcycle.
We're going to die, aren't we...
It's one way.
Then it could all come out, sooner or later.  Nobody should be in on this.  Just you and me.  Or, more correctly, I.
He's too proud to beg for help. And if you wait till this comes out, your offer will be like charity. Completely humiliating.
That's not very logical, Lester.
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
And that's why you're leaving?
Jerry!  Do something --
Okay, so here's what I'll do.  I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
No--
First you gotta tell me something.
Pop Leibel? Sure.
You didn't have a choice?  Where's Kat and what have you done with her?
I did Bianca a favor and it backfired.
Look who's talking.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Like popcorn?
I didn't have a choice.
Knowing what I know?  Enormous gratitude.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with??  I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it.  To you I'm just a girl.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
The dishes?
What?
You usually eat alone?
Cheers.
I don't?
So what did you want? I think we understand each other, no?
You didn't mind too much.
You...
Oh. I think you will recover okay. I think you got what you paid for.
Maybe it's because I live here.
What?  You gonna tell me you're lost?
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
Not for money. With my mother.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call.  You stroll in here at noon.  I got... two people out sick.  Ya think I need this?  I Do Not Need This!
I'll pack my things and meet you downstairs.
You won't of missed much.
I don't understand this... I don't understand this one bit. He was supposed to meet me right her in this lobby. Somethin' bad has happened - I jus know it.
HELL NO!!! That's the last thing we need... A buncha cops runnin' around.
Never heard of it.
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
I will.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
You wouldn't come to find me?  That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
Is that right?
That's fine.  There's always a pause when the jury goes out to consider its verdict.
Don't tell me you're naked back there.
That's how long it takes to turn a hospital inside out.  A lot of people are after you, Jerry.
Right.  Sit up so I can see you.
Them who?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Honey, is something wrong?
Would you please leave.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
What were you going to say?
You're not listening --
You really don't get it.  This story gets filed.  Every time anyone writes anything about me -- they'll dig up these photos.  Newspapers last forever. I'll regret this forever.
And remember -- Spike owes you an expensive dinner.  Or holiday -- depending if he's got the brains to get the going rate on betrayal.
Excuse me?
You're right: of course, you're right. It's just that I've dealt with this garbage for ten years now -- you've had it for ten minutes.  Our perspectives are different.
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
We were eating and puking together in harmony until one day, Tony walked me home from school. He was my first boyfriend.  I was fourteen.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
Scottie, what are you doing?
Yep.  I want him to be front and center and to watch everything.
Marmite - addicted!  Baths - not with other people!  Islands.  Your handwriting.  I could go on all day.  My husband. Almásy nods.
Now.
Now.
What do I love?  I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Yes, that's the trouble with mothers. First you get to like them and then they die.
Yes, madame. You see, I have to get up very early.  My little brother goes to school--  You see, Mother is dead.
You've had your breakfast--oh, but of course you have.
You were. I have work to do. The publisher wants the transcripts by Monday. Go. Make yourself at home.
Uh-huh. Good for you.
It's nothing. A stupid party. Not really a night club, it's, uh...
Yes. It's a bad place. Weird people. Strange things go on.
Professor Claude Rousel. The one your uncle was working with. He teaches cultural history.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Duck!
What is it, John?  John?
Does it make it easier to win?
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much.  He's cuckoo.
They're having a farewell party the last night. Before the Mask goes back to Taiwan.
In a week.
As I recall, you've robbed it before.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
Yeah, I was Emil's box-jumper for almost four years.
It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget.  Where's Macaulay?  I ought to be starting.
He's all right.
His assistant.
I want to believe you, too.
Yeah.  Who are you?
Yes.  He is.
We’re both thinking the same thing, right?
Yup.
I came all the way to Italy in search of a weasel.
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
A Federal offense.
I'm not shy. I've been looked at before.
Goodbye, Mr. Jefferies. I'll see you tomorrow.
The Marquis de la Tours. He was in the lobby. But I don't think he saw me. I'm positive he didn't. Thank heaven! ... But when I came up here, right out in the hall there was King Boris of Alconia!
Am I missing something?
What's wrong with it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
My tits?
The usual, Barry.
Don’t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
If you like.
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Yes.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'd like to see him.  Why don't you bring him down?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
Only.  If he wants to.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house—and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and—
No. No one that I know of.
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I can't help you, sorry.  I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap...  Oh good.
Elena. My name's Elena.
I thought I knew everything about him.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
What is the matter?
Do you? Do you really?
Am I as good as they?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Thanks.  Nice meeting you.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yeah, sweet.  That's a nice way of putting it.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it.  Women like men who are unpredictable.
Plus a bonus.
But you want days too.
Wyatt Earp, I know.  I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet.  This is fortuitous.  That Means lucky.
You want the cake!?
It’s good, right?
Say it, Jack...
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, is that it!
I can take it.
Just to that place down at the bottom of the stairs.  Nothing fancy.
You're fucking psycho.
Pop Leibel owns the Argosy Book Shop. What do you want to know?
Would you like a glass of tea or something?
He can tell you're an animal nut. You are, aren't ya?
You mean he doesn't like bad guys.
Wow, I've never seen him like this. He doesn't usually like guys.
Fuck kindred spirits. My little Puffy here's gonna tell you all you need to know about this guy in about two seconds flat. If he starts yapping, he's a loser; if Puffy's relaxed... well, you got yourself a keeper.
The point is, love isn't about money or social standing or age, it's about connecting with someone, having things in common kindred spirits.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
Princess?  I know of no princess.
I hardly knew her.  She gave me the creeps, though.  I don't know why.
She must really be something.  From a clinical point of view.
How do you know Catherine Tramell saw my reports?
It's the least I could do... considering I got you into this mess with those reports.
Yes you did.  I'm a big girl.  I can handle it.
Bye.
Holy shit.
It's a kiss...  Goodbye...
What happened?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
You like Castro?  I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous?  "Your  honor, I  object!"
Dad?
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yeah.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Can I be honest?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Nothing.
Why?
Oh!
I don't care about bucks.  I might love this guy.
Wow, are you in deep shit.  You know he'll break your heart.
He wants to set me up in a place, give me some money.
I pray for that.
All I'm doing is feeling lousy about it.  I don't know what to do.  What do I do, Kit?
Go for the bucks.
Tuesday.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
I want to thank you.
Those sluts!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
What's that mean?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Do you always ask so many questions?
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Funny, you're the only one
Was it Venza?  Did you get him?
How old is your boy?
I was being foolish?
And you just want to ask me a few questions?
You're not police or FBI; you're just a private investigator?
Yeah.  I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
The kitchen.
I hope so.  I think maybe she sees me now.
Looking for something -- someone.
Yes.
Take a good look at him, Dad.  Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
Just a teensie one –– ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Where're you going?
. . . Superman?. . . . .
I don't know, I guess I never really thought about it...  Is Larry here?
See what happens when I don't have my orange juice?  The human body is only a workable, fairly fragile machine when you treat it with the same respect you'd show to ----  . . . gee . . .
You may kiss my hand.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No -- S.E.R.A.
Yeah.  He's around somewhere.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Wow!
I need to know.
I'm married.
If I weren't married?
You've been telling me what not to do since I was old enough to remember.  I'm sick of it!
That's your fault not mine.
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to be your friend.
Why not?  Look what he's doing for aviation. It takes courage to do what he does. And character! At least he's accomplished something worthwhile. I suppose you'd like to have me marry a business man. Well, I hate business men—particularly if you're a shining example.
Your whole life is devoted to just one thing. To accumulate more money. At least there's romance in what he's doing.
He's no good, Ellie, and you know it. You married him only because I told you not to.
No! Let me go!
What happened?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
Say anything else, and I'll stay tomorrow night too.
I have the whole weekend off.
A Mark Cross overnight case, anyway. Compact, but ample enough.
You said I'd have to live out of one suitcase  I'll bet yours isn't this small?
I'll trade you -- my feminine intuition for a bed for the night.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
You notice that woman when we come in? The white woman sittin' by herself?
We'll find out in a hurry.
I'll be damned if I'm leavin'. That band is too good?
What's this?
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
And the new label?  And the Kinky Wizards?
What kind?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Madam should sleep.
You really want to know, sir?
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
I do, sir.
And you're going to fall for them.
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Yes.  Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
You!
Uh-- in case Dwayne wants to try to reach you.
Any minute I want!
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
WAIT!!  Where are you?
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
Venice?  I love Venice.  With the boats, right?...
Who are you?
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
I trusted you!  I thought you cared about me?!
More bullshit!  More bullshit!  What kind of odds are they giving me?  There must be some kind of office pool.  One month?  A couple of days?
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
Of course not. How...how could it be? Nothing happened.
Not if you take an advance on your credit card.
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
How can I tell?  You've seen both of me.  I only know what you're like here.  You're all I know.  There is no "You" from before.
How could it be so cruel?  How could it torture us like this?
Good-by!
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
You can't.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
OK... whatever.
Do you want to fuck now?
No way... GET OUT!!!
Fuck me.
Congratulations.
Like all the rest of us.  Has this fellow...  ...has he seen the whole family?
You don't ever think about other people?
Jesus.  I do not know.  I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting.  Why don't you go experiment.
I'm not -- hold on...
You smell like baby powder.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody.  All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody.  And it's so easy.  Why is it easy now?
I love you, Jim.  I really mean it.
You don't know anything about me. If you did, you probably wouldn't be here.
You are now required to sit here with me.  Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
And he still wants to marry me!
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You fell in love with her first.
You called the police?
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
Police?
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
No, Victor, no.
We're a big hit.
Oh, my.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
-- The legs.
I thought it might be cute.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.  Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Where is my Lady's lord?
She must've been a bigger fool than me if she ran out on a guy like you...
Your ranch?
He's asleep, right?
Still going.
He does?
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You what?
I know.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
So what did you do?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
He gave me his card.  'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Yeah.  She is.  But you know what?  That's why I'm helping her.  So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
I'd better get back.  Say goodbye here.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
You will.  You will.
Yes.  The thing is... I have to go away today but I wondered, if I didn't, whether you might let me see you a bit... or, a lot maybe... see if you could... like me again.
You expect me to tell the truth about my life to the most indiscreet man in England?
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Oh -- but it can't be.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
Just a girl, I work at Magnin's --
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
I think so, but I've never seen it so acute.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Oh, Betty --
Yes.
Will he understand Spanish?
... Thomas, yeh.
Well, maybe we should talk ab...
Michael, it's Wednesday night, you can't possibly be getting married on Su...
Well, you were pretty great!
Jack, I --
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
To hell with sex.
Honest?
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint...  Whooo.
It's started.
Norville!
I'd never do that.
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
You're never going to marry?
I can just hear you now. "Get out of here you perfect, wonderful woman! You're too good for me!"
Look, Mr. Jefferies. I'm not educated. I'm not even sophisticated. But I can tell you this -- when a man and a woman see each other, and like each other -- they should come together -- wham like two taxies on Broadway. Not sit around studying each other like specimens in at bottle.
Intelligence! Nothing has caused the human race more trouble. Modern marriage!
Baloney! Once it was see somebody, get excited, get married -- Now, it's read books, fence with four syllable words, psychoanalyze each other until you can't tell a petting party from a civil service exam
You said that.
Yeah, I peed in the fountain there once.  Give me a break.
You're not from L.A., huh?
When?
Yes I do!
How are you, you three scoundrels?
You can have it for good. It is my wedding present.
Huh? Oh, yes - yes, of course. Her sister. Yes, I've been her sister for a long time.
And locked it.
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Cold War's over, Jerry.
Santa Rosa?
Realized what?
Eleven.
Elaborate on 'they,' okay?
I'll be fine.  Let's worry about Henry Finch.  P.O. Box in St. Louis.  He's the last on the list. I haven't been able to reach him yet.
Ronny, please...
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Who... Who is that?
That's the experiment?  Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Thank you.
Too bad.  Because I'm terrible at 'yes.'
Working.
Look, you're a nice guy, but I'm not really dating right now.
Working.
You got a live arm there.
It's all right.  It's organic.
I don't trust a man who don't dance.  It ain't natural.
Annie Savoy.  Wanta dance?
You need a nickname.
Yes. It's almost there.
Lloyd was such a gentleman.  He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it.  I called him basic.  Can you believe I did that?
Then call me later.
Dad, I'm so glad I went.  Goodnight.
That's fine! That's fine!  Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
John! I'm so glad to see you. I—I was terribly worried.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Did I say that?
Bobbie, please.
Right, I guess those are the kids --
To make you feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.
What's the difference?
It was like sex.  What else could it be like?
I don't like to do what people expect. Then they expect it all the time and they get disappointed when you change.
I dazzled him with my wit
Acting the way we do.
Yeah, well, don't let it get out
Well, she was about six-three, only spoke Portuguese and had really long grey hair.
Angels don't get any older, son.
Are you kidding?  You're not kidding?  You're not kidding!
Burt Reynolds.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
No.
Coming.  I can't sleep.  I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
What?  No!
This is empty, just coming!
You wear your weeds as well as golden armor, Jack.  Like a true Prince... a champion!
Nay, dearest Jack... you are to be my husband.  I want none other.
What's the matter?
And I love you, my husband.
Thank you again. Good-night.
You're a great date.  I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
So you're still breast-feeding?
Too much blue in crimson.
Oh. Yeah.  I gotta bunch of them.
I don't know.  I hadn't thought it out that far.
You sure this goes somewhere?
You don't have to keep walking with me.   I'm okay from here.
Thanks.
...I don't know what you mean....
Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir?
Well, all right, but...
What?
Yes.  Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock.  Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting?
I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address.
Oh. Oh, well, all right.
I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call?
No.
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
The letter he sent.
What letter?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket.  Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Have you called Betty?  Maybe you should.
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes.  I know.  The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself.  And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Yes, you were.  A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
My very words.
He wasn't. One day I came home and found him taking a shower -- with another girl. And her sister.
They should arrest people for obeying the speed limit.
-- Actually, my heaviest relationship was with a rock singer named Ramblin' Bobby Holt. When I turned twenty- one, I went to Europe with visions of being free and independent. My luck, he was on the plane. I landed in Paris and fell in love before I could claim my baggage.  We were together for almost a year. I thought he was it.
Water...  Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Doc!!!  So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
Please don't lie.  I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Pants.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
The blue.
I just need to lay down.  I've been running around all day.
No!
Fine.  One.
I'm too tired for this now.  I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up?  I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
What's she trying to do? Why doesn't she turn him in?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Right there, Bobbie.
Yes.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
You have the right to ask me certain personal questions?
At...
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
That was very well put, Ted.
They do not!
Why is my veggie burger the only burnt object on this grill?
Gee, I'm flattered.  What an incredibly romantic gesture. Cancel the roses, I've decided to lie to her instead.
It couldn't be me.  I hardly knew him.
You were terrific.  And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Charlie, I had a strange experience.  I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you.  And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Then hold me.
Sorry...
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yes.
What?
I can be quick.  I can even be funny.
And you?
There’s finally a reason for the whole world to revolve around you?
Yeah, you do...
I would totally love to go there. But I hear it's really hard to get in.
She's so nice.
Hi.
I was told you were in a fight.
John?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort.  Do I make myself clear?
I'll go see how he's doing.
Nothing's going on.  Maybe he doesn't want to be alone.  He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
I would call it-- unforgivable.
You did.
Nepal? Have you been?
No thanks.
Wow. That's a place I've always wanted to go. Is it true the mountains are so tall you can't see the tops?
You own a home there?
Hello. Get me the police, please.
You shit!
Oh, no.
Shampoo, got it!
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini.  Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
I think I should, don't you?
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh!
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, it's magnificent!
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
I wish she hadn't.
Fine.  ) Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
You're damn right I am.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
He's down in someplace called Positano.  Peter says we can make it there by morning.
But you don't love me.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Kevin?  Do you not love me?
Yes --
I think you're so right, Kevin.
Kevin...you're not your dad.  The two of us, we're not your parents.
Do you want me to get it?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Call me later.
Ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Are you ready?
Bye, Barry.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
It's a long story, this one.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Jerry.  Please.  You don't understand.  I have to know.  It's all I think about.  Do you have any idea what it's like not to know?
Then why did you have his picture in your safe deposit box?
At a horse show.
Did you kill my father?!
Hey -- look officer -- I can explain everything. It was just -- you know, everything all of a --
Because I didn't want to be touched! I didn't think you'd get that!
Oh well that shouldn't take you more than another, oh, two and a half or three years, should it?
So do I.
Twenty.
What's Cao Ben?
God, I hate that time.  That pick up stuff time.  I just went through that before I came here.  You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play?  That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Will you please just go?
No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.
Everything go alright?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
How did it go with you guys?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You hope.
I’d be happy to. You’re welcome.
Muncie!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Let me hold him.
Don't be afraid.  You can tell me.
Let's find a telephone.
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
We found each other, didn't we?
I know, look at his little hands.
He's so tiny.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
You have no idea.
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Ohh!
Why?
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
She got me an abortion...
Oh, you know exactly what I mean, honey? It'd make the future so simple and nice.
Wouldn't it be fabulous if we somehow stayed in love for the rest of our lives?
I just think about things as they come up. I never been much of a planner.
Oh, I see, I see.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lord.
Something serious has happened.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
I don't know.  Excessive masturbation?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
This is the second opinion.
Then why did you do it?
How do you do?
No gas.
This car runs on gas.
What are you doing?
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
Am I interrupting?
'Is it really me?'
-- This play means a lot to me.
What was my mission?  To help my country?  But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
What?
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Listen, Walter --
You -- you --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Without any future?
I mean what I said.
Not quite -- it seems.  Goodbye, Jeff.
And it's deflating to find out that the only way I can be part of it -- is to take out a subscription to your magazine. I guess I'm not the girl I thought I was.
Right.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
"Occupational hazard".
I like guys if that's what you're asking.  Not that I trust'm.
I just hope it was worth three hundred bucks.
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
Not yet.
She blames Tony Pee-Pants Pinterello for everything. The fall of the British Empire, the Cold War, the internet.
Pinching?  Where?
Sure you wanna do this? Might be a way they could track us.
I brought you that, too.
Vano da, mechteba?! Soun domo kala chon hammas!
Wait a minute.  What about me?
Am I!
No.  I thought not.
Do you sing and dance?
Nooo.  If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
If we could just eat first.
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Well, this one time?  At band camp? We were playing this game, I don't know if you know it?  But it's called spin the bottle?  And I had to kiss this guy named Marc Wander on the lips?  And...
But I can't be dry.
Uh.  How about promoting a bridesmaid?  Someone you know for at least forty-five minutes.
The bridesmaids are my only two female relatives under forty. Identical twin debutantes from Nashville, who are basically vengeful sluts.  With amazing bodies!
I don't know... My friends think I'm too picky. I think I'm just a weirdo magnet. I did come close once -- just last year, in fact. There was this guy he lived in San Francisco.
That's right. And the good thing is you can do it anywhere.
...and then it was all over.  We haven't spoken since.
I don't know. I always felt like I did, like there was another me...
Somewhere.  See I was taken away by the Priddies when I was a baby.  I was adopted.
What?  I don't understand you.  I don't understand anything anymore.
Buon' giorno.
I can get in the back.
Really?
There! You said it was boring.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
What do you mean &quot;Uh Oh&quot;???
In the tar??
Owh...
You think so?
Kevin, this is serious!
I knew this would happen. Soon as that piece of filth got out of Pee Dee, I knew there'd be trouble. He's just got some kind of influence over her I can't decipher. There's somethin' wild in Lula I don't know where it comes from. You gotta find 'em, Johnnie.
Grandmama Pace had a long, smooth white neck. It was like on a statue it was so white?
Started he couldn't remember things? Got real violent? Mama kept tellin' me it was on account of lead poisoning from cleanin' the old paint off our house without usin' a mask... But I don't know. Seems like his brain just fell apart in pieces.
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
For work.....
Ok.
Where do you have to go?
No!
That's never been proven
Thank you.
You bullshittin' me?
I don't care.
See, we're very modern.
Don't you want me to?
Congratulations.
Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight.
You look... different.
You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere.
It doesn't make sense to me.
All day long I've tried to keep my mind on work.
And you, and you friend Doyle --  Did you hear from him again -- since he left?
What did they say?
What are they going to do?
You've got to tell me what happened?
They are English. They don't understand.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Well, yes, but he seems to be more upset by the death of his friend.
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
Not long ago...
"I'm an incredible woman?"  What is this, a death sentence?
How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
I wouldn't know.
Too happy. That's why I discharged her.
I'd better order some food.  That sounds like an interesting case.  Wouldn't you like to take it?
Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case.  Girl mysteriously murdered.  No one knows who did it.  They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Six weeks. But who's counting?
We can't leave it IN THERE, it's got all our accounts, everything that can NAIL us to a goddam CROSS!!!
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
That's right.
Jesus God, it's going through.
FUCKING THING!!!
What's the matter?
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores.  I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
My husband...you know him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
Thank you for taking me home.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
Every word.
You make it up, but it has to be believable.  They call it suspension of disbelief.
Please, Yuri.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
You're acting like a child.
That's ridiculous.
Gimme like, eight and nine off the top ten list...
Can that kind of defect be passed on genetically?
They'll be looking for you.
No--I was just--maybe--
I have an aunt, you see. Aunt Tessa. She's seventy years old, and veddy prim and strait-laced.  She's coming back from Europe at the end of the month, and I'm going to give her a myna bird that'll talk to her.
You should have known better than to write, Romeo. I found that out a long time ago.
You hypocrite.  Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--<i>what</i> you are?  Don't you get <i>any</i> satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Yeah, I'm here.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
...They was laughin' arm in arm like animals.
We... we went to school together. College.
Yes.
Oh, no you don't!
Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back.  The way a crow/Shook down on me/The dust of snow/From a hemlock tree/Has given my heart/A change of mood/And saved some part/Of a day I rued.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
It's easy to be dedicated, when you care about something...
No, I would have remembered that name. The only Stella I ever knew was a parrot.  Was this before Leslie? Before us?...
I know, that's why we were meant to be together...
You never mentioned a 'Stella' to me.
Hello?
What a nice compliment.
Uh-oh.
You want to lose this putz or not?!?
-- You know, I used to be a high fashion model. Tried it for six months and almost freaked. Makeup, silly clothes, a little man saying 'darling' every two seconds...
My job, my rules.
Oh my god, I thought--
You...you shouldn't have come. I don't have time now.
Ted, what are you doing here?
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
My script?
Murder?
Ross.  Real pleased to meet you.  I'm Erin.
I guess I did.
Wait, I thought you said you'd never been outta Kansas...
Nope.  Maiden.
Forget it, it'll never work.
Isn't he here?
Husband?
And Jonas?
He's shown himself.  Why haven't you arrested him or killed him or done whatever it is you do?
Where do you think Jerry is?
I'm going to find him.  Because he'd find me.
Good night.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No.  I have to go in.  I live here.
How is that Wally doing?
I like well your conceit, Jack.  Tis rare to find an honest lad in this troubled world.
Why then, there thou hast.  We be lucky worse has not befallen us.
Where he always is.
Lock the door behind you.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Ya looked through it?
But they're nice hips.  I looked up your records-- You've hit 227 home runs in the minors. That's great!
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
Damn.
Every ship but the four you sent.
No.  It's a Christmas present.
Finished with these?
You’re mad...
Oh, I'm not blaming you.  I just know me. I'd be jealous. Jealous of . . . of all humanity.  Some rival, huh?
What's this?
Not so... easily.  Why aren't you... fighting...?  go on... we're almost there...
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn.  He is learning.
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
And nobody could tell me who he was -- an exiled prince or a mercenary or a bullfighter or -- but I felt it stirring inside me, this -- this wild, pagan feeling --
Or you'll get me shoved back in the brig you mean; another month with the bull-dykes.
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
Hopefully.
You're certain?
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Now? She's a night manager at McDonalds.
By reputation. He got Ann Rumsey that cute little island of George's.
Who's she?
Muriel Rumsey.
Miles Massey.
Who's Rex's guy?
Do you know him?
Of Massey Myerson?
Forgery? Fraud?
Your forgetting Rex Rexroth?
How's it going?
Holly, please.  Don't insult me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about it.
What do you believe in then?
I'm going now, Cole.
So beautiful!
Yeah, but --
What will I tell Annie?
Don't you go to school?
Bodega Bay? Where's that?
That's all right.
Monday?
Well, I...
Well, where did he go?
The check, Bruce!
What's the matter?
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, wasn't it?
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
How'd the show go?
So why's he do it?
Aren't the kids asleep?
Not so good.
Mitch...
Where'd you get your subscribers?
Well, I've been tracking them down all morning.
No, it's awful.  Oh my, it's awful.
How can you do that?
Course, if it's later rather than sooner, I'd hate to be you at six o'clock.  You've got a lot of explaining to...
What are you doing?
You think he'll like it?
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day."  I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Fries.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
And mean it...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
I do.  Your furry friend thought he'd make a buck or two telling the papers where I was.
When you took your first snapshot -- did you ever think it would bring you to this?
Really?  The entire British press just woke up this morning and thought 'Hey -- I know where Anna Scott is.  She's in that house with the blue door in Notting Hill.'  And then you go out in your goddamn underwear.
Faith--
Good luck.
What do you need money for?
Woman...
I don't care. I love you. Nothing else matters. We can run away. Everything'll take care of itself.  Please, Peter. You can't go out of my life now. I couldn't live without you.  Oh, Peter—
I love you.
I was wrong!!
Never drive again!
Yes!
What are you doing here?
My children make me happy. I miss them so much.  Beth. Scott and Beth.  I'm going to name my daughter after you.
But I'm remembering the future.
I remember that book!  Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
Then call me tomorrow.
My shoes.
Yes.
Would you rather leave?
Well excuse me.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
I don't want to come here anymore.
That I want you to take me home.
I used to like yogurt.
Sure.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
You've got everything?
You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger?
What?
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
-- you phony asshole --
So you haven’t seen the film, then?
You don't have any idea how lucky you are!
Then why is there fear behind your eyes?
Different?
Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now.
When was this?
I think I'll have some of that, too.  I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know.  And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia.
What do you mean?
Isn't there?  Maybe there isn't. Maybe there's never anything between Mitch and any girl.
Annie -- there's nothing between Mitch and me.
You needn't worry. It's over and done with. A long time ago.
I suspected as much.
I guess you knew that, anyway.
Hello, Daniel.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't.  Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
We are. And it's winding down.
Are you forgetting about the Atcheson, Topeka and the Santa Fe?
Is that right?  I'd like a word with him.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea.  You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
Who?  The jerk who's running your life?
You said it was over, right? You said not to worry any more, all over, right?
Right back at the start, right?
I guess I'll never know, will I?
My God, I thought it was over. And here I am, daddy, right back at the start.
God, you're just like him! Just keep me locked away in the dark, so I can't experience anything for myself
Look at all this beautiful food, so lovingly prepared...
I'm not stupid enough to repeat your mistakes.
No, I don't think you're like, "I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.
But I'm weird.
But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious!
No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things.
Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness.
Hi.
What with the psychosis and all, yeah.
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Hi.
Yes.  Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
I'm gonna pay you back next time I see ya, babe.  Just wait, I'm gonna do something real nice for you some day.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself.  If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed.  Disastrously.  Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body.  I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry.  He's pretty amazing.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed.  You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Do you remember Henry Birdson?  The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
Cool your jets a second.  Here's some money.
No.
That light.
I think...it...works.
He's going to kill himself.  Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
Hi.  Where've you been?
Left-handed, he was <u>funny</u>. He'd been doing all this scary, intense work...then he found out he could draw this stuff, and make me laugh, and he liked that. <i></i> And then the nightmares just...stopped.
I'm serious. It was bicameral disjunction - right brain and left brain out of balance. He was a rightie, so I made him switch the pencil to his left hand. Just to see what'd come out.
Switch hands.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Is that true?
I hope so for your sake.  Let us examine the case. What does the lawyer say?
Do you know how much a cow costs, Comrade Iranoff?
Two thousand francs. If I stay here a week I will cost the Russian people seven cows.  Who am I to cost the Russian people seven cows?
Hi. Hi, hi.
By making me ill, he is punishing me!  I just don't know what for.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing.  Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
I should have told you sooner --
Hi.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
No, he looks a lot...
Shit! Fuck! What’s fucking wrong with people!  I’m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
No, I wanna say hi.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
Sorry.
That's because I wanted them to!
No, dammit! I mean me! That Rembrandt...that Rembrandt!
Hi, Jonah.  Sam.  And who is this?
Well... have a good flight.
Ok, bye.
He's learning his letters.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
They're stragglin'.
Is that what you call it?
There.
Well, you had better!!
Look! I'm limping!  How attractive is that?!  What if this is for life?!
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old...  Travels well though.  You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Thank God he did.
Really?
More and more in the past few weeks. And she wanders. God knows where she wanders. I followed her one day.
Oh, Rocky!
You didn't!
Yeah.  It's kind of nice.
Wanna play?
Professor Saunders, over in Berkeley.
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
The money?
My dear, you don't know how impressive I could be. Did you ever see me in my regalia with my diadem and all my jewels?
It is not enough to be witty, madame. People grow tired of being entertained. You made that mistake before. Problems were never solved by bowing from a balcony.
Very interesting, my dear, but couldn't you write all that from Moscow? A dissertation on love on Soviet stationery -- would be an amusing paradox.
People cannot be taken away, madame, neither a hundred and sixty million nor one. Not if you have their love. You hadn't. That's why you're not in Russia any longer, and that's why you came here this morning.
In that case I can only say good-by.
I must insist that you leave.
You can't deny we gave the people their money's worth -- almost -- eight tumbling Romanoffs -- eight!
Terry...?
Tommy, what happened?
Let me by.
Give me that.  I'm going to throw it in the sewer where it belongs.
Don't you advance on me.
Thank you.
What?
A hanger.
Either one will be fine.
Cold is good--  Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
It's over on the TV. All it says is: "Dear Clarence." I couldn't write anymore. I didn't not want to ever see you again. In fact, it's stupid not to ever see you again. Las night... I don't know... I felt... I hadn't had that much fun since Girl Scouts. So I just said, "Alabama, come clean, Let him know what's what, and if he tells you to go fuck yourself then go back to Drexl and fuck yourself."
I don't know. I didn't talk with them. The plan was for me to bump into you, pick you up, spend the night, and skip out after you fell asleep. I was gonna write you a note and say that this was my last day in America. That I was leaving on a plane this morning up to Ukraine to marry a rich millionaire, and thank you for making my last day in America my best day.
Uh-huh.
My pimp.
Uh-huh.
Knowing I have to die...
Don't deny me, Duff.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I wasn't Lena.  I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Child, please.  Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
My parents were divorced.
Maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
A bad combination.
No, thank you.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
I've never been in an apartment above a store.  You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
Yes.
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Huh? Oh... yeah.
Those are my clothes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Yes?
That sign.  Do you think I could have the room for a single night?
Well, I'd really hope to rent it for...
I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full.
Sure. You can have it.  Where's your bag? In the car?
It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it.
What was that?  Did you hear that?
It sounded like it came from the courtyard.
I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here.
Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up?
Might we watch, too?
No way... Would you?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us.  Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
SAILOR!!!!
It's so beautiful.  It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from.  You see what I mean.  There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them.  Surprises are highly overrated.
Of course I am.
You were married?  All those falls, I'm surprised you had time.
Uh-huh.
Sure.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I'm not working for any other paper!
Look at this!
I just play my own collection.
He's grubbing for money, father.
Is he? Yeah, I thought so, too. I tried to laugh, but I couldn't. It stuck in my throat.
Aw, cut it out, will you? You'll get me thinking about Charlie again.
Yeah, then what?
Search me. Ask the Gypsies.
Here's a guy that's wholesome and fresh. To us he looks like a freak. You know what he told me tonight? He said when he gets married he wants to carry his bride over the threshold in his arms.
The guy's balmy.
People have been crucified before.
Why? Why do we have to do it?
You started out to be a successful newspaper woman, didn't you?
He couldn't have checked out-- I was supposed to meet him here.
Excuse me?
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
George --
I'm sorry.
Singing?
Come back some other time, will you?
He's your son.
I didn't see you this morning.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
Jerome--?
What is it?
No.  That wouldn't be fair.  Where are we going, Jerry?
Thanks.
She's an editor.
Isn't that interesting?
They're not happy, sir.
They say their friend was suppose to have a heart attack and die in his sleep.
They blame you for the compromise.
In Detroit. This weekend.
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
Well.
He wanted to see me again.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Really?
Why?
Why should <U>I</U> kill him?
I don't like coconuts.
Well?...
Where are they?
Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian.  I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police...
You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with.
I told you to go, madame.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
No, I read it on the message.
So...what was I...oh, yeah. Do you honestly think that I want to be single and miserable? That I want to be obsessed with some asshole who led me on for years then -- out of the blue -- shattered my heart.
I don't...  I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there...  What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
You bet I wouldn't.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Good Lord!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
Georgia.
He's not really my uncle.
You mean, besides Elvis?  I'm a human being.  Sure.  Once. First time I ever ran away from home, I got as far as Atlanta. I met this boy.  He'd been with his parents on their way to Chicago.  They stopped at a gas station.  He went to the john. When he came back they'd split. We sorta started looking out for each other.  Aw, he was sweet. And boy, was he good looking, y'know, dark hair and eyes. The chicken hawks were on him all the time.  He hated that. Sometimes we'd find a safe place to crash nights and we'd curl up together and we'd talk about all these crazy things.  The two of us getting married someday. Having kids.  Stupid stuff.
Why, Peter! Don't you want to hear about our lovely friends?
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
You tried to once.  It was pretty pitiful.
Wha--  What kind of things do you build?
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
"Would you like ground pepper on that salad, Ms. Branch?" Remember?
I'm sorry.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Is it me?
Where are you going?
Howard is a beautiful person.
It was his idea. It was a gesture of love and trust. Be happy for me, Miles.
Whom?
Just them?
What do we do?
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex.  Silk suits you well.  But you are not eating enough.  One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
Smells like fish.
Brian told you that?
Smells like tuna number two to me.
It's fun!  It's high.
I already explained about that.
That was very interesting research George was doing!
...Hoppi-hoppa.
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
I'm sure she will.
Surprised?
Are you married?
I didn't know you had one.
Just for the day?
Uh, Udall?
So?
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
We've done that already.
I guess I did.
What's wrong?
John Bonham?
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
A lot of money.  Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
You drive like a maniac!
Stewart, would you mind telling me why you're not going?
Look out for my lipstick, Stewart.
Are you crazy?
Don’t patronize me. They’ve clearly been at this a while.
Right.  Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
I have to see you.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
You bastard.
Suck my dick!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
And then what, Faith?
Scared.  No, not scared.  Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up.  I was a threat.  Now I know why.  She was afraid she'd be seen.  That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right?  I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on.  I guess that's part of the reason why --
Okay, here's what I think.  We find out what all the subway stops for that train are-- the subway system's really not that big in Rome, we could narrow it down and--
No.  I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
Yeah, yeah. Okay, I think I know what to do. I'll call him right now.
Magda's right, I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
The little shit lied to me about that guy!
Holy shit...
Right.  Okay...  It's meant to be right?  This is it.
Not yet.  Don't say anything yet.  Okay?
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal.  All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table.  And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas.  And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
You're mad, aren't you?
It smelled.
That's right, that's right.  You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No.  What do you do for a living, Gary?
—and that—
Well, I've seen her pictures, and I don't think she's so hot.
Of course I haven't got a nose.
I don't know. It's a mystery
Nor you for me.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years.  You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
What are you doing?
Uh-uh-why?
Went to high school with him. But...
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are.  You're sure you don't mind?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
Men have ways.
It's really terrible.
Yeah.  Sociopaths.  They're able to figure out what you want them to be and then they act like that.
And it ruins everything else.
Good. I thought for a moment I was the only embarrassed one in the room.
How did we get from your bad dreams to my taking a holiday with a patient?
Now, David, I said I would keep you company, but I meant right here and now.
All I am to you is a sex fantasy then?
You're being awfully forward, aren't you?
Tell me something, Dorie.  A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
I'm Evelyn.  And I'm just a nurse.  But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar.  Whatta ya say?
How often you fight like this?
What do you get for winning?
That's not a question, is it?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
What's that?
So you're a lawyer.
Come on, Jack -- don't.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
To who?  Are you asking me?
I love you, too.
Okay.  So... what, uh... What just happened?  Just now?  Jus then?  In there?
Sometimes, sure.
The world is full of guys.  Be a man.  Don't be a guy.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart.  Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
What?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Oh no!
I don't know.
In a saloon?
I'll be right down.  It's right tight.
I said I don't have any.
Thank you.
Is it terribly erotic?
Is it awfully violent?
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I'd like to get out of here.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
Cause it's my office party.  If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking.  I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew.  I'd find their little toys all over the place.
Out with Belinda?
You saw him?
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
I'm going to take it.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
You sure you're comfortable?
Are you all right?
That's our man. He's made to order.
This is Lena.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
Arlyn and Jane commited suicide. He said they commited suicide.
Come on.
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white!  Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
He's not coming.
Jump in the water!!
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
When are you leaving?
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, I mean it more now.
Yeah.
Oh, no, really - I'll be all right.
Oh, did I? I'm sorry . . .
No, thank you. I'll be all right.
Whatareyoudoing?!
You're Damon Bradley?
For Pete's sake, Calvin!  We've got guests!
Well, put it down and come in!
You know, you're a good kid.
But in what ways?
Is it the shakedown hon? You picked a loser, I just don't have it.
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
I got my foot on the floor.
No, that's fine.  I was going to steal one myself but now I've changed my mind.  Signed by the author, I see.
It was you who got the standing O. It was you drawing on the belly over there...
You want to leave? But Stu - you're a big hit! Everyone loves you!
Can't you give it to me later?
You forgot the Hula!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks.  Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I don't want it.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Good night, Daddy.
Sorry. Forgetful.
Oh no--he's shaking off the sign, Jackson.  Big mistake...
Such a sad world, be there no unicorns to brighten it.
If you want to look at it that way...
Oh... I lived with a President.  It isn't any fun.
... Me, too.
So this is it?
I know.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
-- is that what this is all about?
Nowhere... Hi, Daddy.
Where've you been?
-- is that right?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train.  And no tricks, Walter!
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry.  Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too.  That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
We can get these people.  With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Okay, fine.  I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
It's alright...  this is our destiny.
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
You've travelled over six thousand miles and now you're gonna play hard to get?
All of the sudden, I'm feeling kind of nervous.  God, I hate blind dates.  Why couldn't we just have arranged marriages in America?
What is it?
Of course not.
Do you want personal insights and adolescent secrets?  I don't do those.
I told you I had a vivid imagination.
You shouldn't play this game.
Oh, it's a charity dinner. The money goes to a good cause, but I don't have anybody to go with...
Umm...
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Who is it?
It's Kathryn.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
What the hell do you think's the matter.  I could wait for you someplace.
You hearing me?
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
Unwell?
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Never heard of him.
Why?
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
You know how to box?
I do.
I was wondering...
Yes, I did.
Playing...
What about?
The house payments.
I want romance.
What do you want?
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
If it's just the same to you, we'll sit right here till they come.  Got a toothpick?
Hay—in my teeth.
What'd you say we're supposed to be doing?
Well, you've given me a very good example of the hiking—
Needn't rub it in.  What're you eating?
Did you get my money?
What? What?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I'll bet!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
I'm glad.
Your place?
There’ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it’s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. We’ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard.  I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat’s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Are you sure I can borrow this?
Kurt thought?  What about you?  Do you think anymore?
And, what, I'm not serious?
<u>Not personal</u>?  That's my <u>work</u> in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time.  If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
How dare you take that away from me.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
See you later.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Home sweet home.
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Yes.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I had a good time tonight.
Don't tell me, Oprah did a show--
Where to?
Mmm. I made good time.  Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Great!
Go ahead...
Good.
Scientologist.
Oh.
I have a headache. You have a headache?
Father!  Thank God you're better!  I really need your help.  We've only got a few more hours.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So...we won?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
I am not like my mother!
Yes.
Aren't we early?
I've got something for you.
To us. To the Mask.
I'll send you a postcard. Got to go.
Oh, really?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
How long does Doug take?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
Oh la vache!
He played in the town band, too.
Don't be silly -- he would not do anything. He is not yet old enough to be interested in girls. He says collecting stamps is much more satisfying to a man of his age.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Don’t do this, Jack... But he continues...
And...?
...my feet are hurtin’...
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
I don't care.
Why is he not here?
Then why send me back to them?!
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy.  He's a little prick!
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
But you have now, and I know now that you are a man who employs business methods which in Russia would be punished by death.
Your tactics are useless. My name is neither Buljanoff, Iranoff, nor Kopalski.
What are you after?
What?
Major.  Dish.
Good.  How long ago did your wife die?
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
Mother ....  you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would.  But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Two thousand dollars.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know.  H-how much do you need?
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy...  and some old debts I have outstanding.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
The antibiotics weren't working.  It's what I believe, George.
That wasn't a dream.  That was Sam.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
I heard already.
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
They go. John. They go.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
That's impossible.  A guy can't --
No, Clarence. Just forget it, babe. I just wanna disappear from there.
I don't even know your name.
Like what?
I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh...
Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Do you <u>know</u> King Boris?
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
Okay. Thank you.
I've got an hour. Can I buy you a coffee?
You know you can come under the blanket.
What was her name?
Why?
No.
Working.
Yeah.
How are we feeling tonight?
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
John Doe. The one in there.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
You like music?
A man might what?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
Oh -- you would!
So how are you?
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
Oooh!
It's been a long time.
Hello, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
You never have dessert.
What's the matter?
I shouldn't.
... all right.  I'll meet you in the lobby.  But only cause you're paying me to.
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
Hello?
I don't care to bargain.
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me.
I don't believe that.  I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
Okay.
Dad??
Dad?
Mr. Warne?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
I mean it strikes me funny that every time Superman comes around, you disappear.
) Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty—six.
My ticket?
Oh, thank you. Must have fallen out of my pocket.
What are you talking about?
Will you please tell me what you're raving about!
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Yes --
I've been with stinking old men who've made me want to puke but I've never had anyone make me feel as dirty as you did tonight.
You're out looking here?
Shut up, you!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
I didn't get any chicken.
Don't fake me out, Clark.  Or whoever you are.
Why did yo do this for me?
What you got a picture of your heart for?
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
It doesn't work like that.  God, you're gorgeous.  Want to dance?
I want you to take this... to remember by.
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm staying, Jean.
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
Because my boyfriend, who I thought was in America, is in fact in the next room.
You've got to go.
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't...
I don't know if I can with my leg.
I saw the light.  I thought maybe you were up.
Mind if I sit down?
Daddy, what's the matter?
What is it, Daddy --?
Your folks live there?
In Birmingham.
Yes, aren't you?
They've taken your clothes?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
I want to experience childbirth.
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Yes.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother.  Oh-h...  I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
It's everyone's trick, Kevin.  But I did pick it up from you.
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
Your phone.
But, Ted, the invitations have already gone out.
What's he been in?
No.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
It better be.
I bet your mom sang to you.
So one day we'll meet.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
I-- I must've misplaced it.
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
And why was the alarm on?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Yep. It's going to be a law.  I broke up with Charlie last night.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Hi, Richard.
Oh, please, Dad—
Oh, no—no.
Certainly!  Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
STUFF.  Got a light?
I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about --
I'm reporting you to the IRS.
Yes.
Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut.
Yes.
That's the way a clock works. There's nothing wonderful about it. You merely feel you must put yourself in a romantic mood to add to your exhilaration.
It's false sentimentality.
You don't understand.  The man I'm supposed to marry is on that plane.
Oh--won't YOU come in?
it's okay..
Uh oh...  Can I offer you some coffee?
But I'm the woman in the mirror!
And so explain it away?  But there is a way to explain it, you see. If I'm mad? That would explain it, wouldn't it?
I'm not mad. I'm not mad. And I don't want to die, but there's someone inside me, there's a somebody else, and she says I must die... Scottie, don't let me go!
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
I don't understand...
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
Yes.
Where are you taking us?
Happy for him.  And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Closer to eight.
Pigsty.
I can't talk right now.
My dad died.  My dad, my dad.
Pig died.
No --
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
True.
You have no right to keep us here.
But you're his brother.
I think you have your answer.
You were supposed to be reading words.
Can you even imagine?  Who the hell would go to this a bastion of commercial excess?
You ' re looking at this from the wrong perspective.  We're making a statement.
Oh, good.  Something new and different for us.
Why do men chase women?
You lost your head, it happens.  I'm so fuckin jazzed!  Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I am, too.
Just, hurry.
Okay on the count of three.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Not exactly.
I know. Just I'm sorta uncomfortable about the way some things is goin', and this don't help soothe me.
Good seeing you again.
Why are you doing this to me?
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Now you stay put!
If we could sell tickets, we'd make a fortune.
He's the original. There are no carbon copies of that one.
I was the world's sweetest ingenue.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Oh, honey.  There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Not all day.  I'll be home after lunch.
I thought I might stop by.
I'll get something for us to drink --
He wants help with his lines --
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
That is lingerie.
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's fine.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway?  Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God!  Oh, you knew I wanted this...  God, it's terrific, God!
What... huh?
Oh! My God!
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
I thought I'd try it.  You look good.
I still don’t buy your story but I figured it can’t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Hi.
George --
I kissed him, Kit.  On the mouth.
We're going to an opening at the opera tonight. We'll dine at Ernie's first.  Which is easier?
Let's forget that we ever met.
I was sent here by my country to fight you.
Where do you fit?
I must go.
As a representative of Moscow...
Yeah.
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I'm right here.
Where?
What about the car?
It's a brassiere. You know about those things. You're a big boy, now.
No, I didn't know that.
No.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up.  I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records.  They kinda surprised me --
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains.  Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy.  You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah?  I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Right.
Hell, no.  I hate lawyers.  I just work for them.  You got a minute?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
This is a real nice place you got here.
The idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.
The Queen has consented?
How about some ginger pie?
Harold?
I wish we did. You married?
Why are we leaving?
I'll get you through.  Move and smile.  And smile and move...
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
No, I'm not.  I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond.  Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'll be the judge of that.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Well, of course, I wouldn't take it.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Thanks a lot.
You played it pretty cool here, waiting for three days to call.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Uh huh...  Okay, we'll be there. How is he, anyway?
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
We start from scratch--
No problem.  We'll just sell another baseball card.
I know.
Well, another day, another dollar.  Stop staring at me!!
Night!
It's your life.  And, by the way, it's a dandy.
You're so clever.
I'm just tired.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
Yes.
Don't Duff--
I won't ask you to.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Get away from me!
No....
Who's that?
Thursday.
Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
To the loveliest story I ever heard.
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Is there milk in them already?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
How are you doing?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
...George. I do.  My best friend once said if you were any handsomer it would be a crime...
In July???
And certainly pretty.
How long have you known her?
She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch?
In a bird shop.
Benjamin, have you ever been severely beaten about the face and neck?
No what?
I thought not.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Yes.
You can learn to like it.
Would you rather me be making love to him, using your name, or making love to you, using his name?
You see how nice things are when we go slow?
I didn't say "Crash".  I said Nuke.
Honey, don't ever listen to a woman when she's making love. They'll say the strangest things.
And he is living proof.
Never mind where... Get outta here... I mean it, Sailor.
I heard about it.  You're lucky he lived.
I'm glad they let you out.
What's a demur?
But one day you wake up and realize you've been had.  Of course life isn't like the movies.  That's why there are movies.
What?
I won't.  And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
Let me help you along, Martin. You're a sociopath!
Okay. Great, Martin, that's just great. Meaning to life... Mmm....
That's probably a good idea.
You never could have kept this from me.
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus...  Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car.  That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
Yes.
No, it's all right.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Alright.  I want you to leave and go back to New York.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
Nothing.
Because he's my friend, too.
I'd like to come with you.
No! That's not true!
Where are you going?
Thanks.  The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master.  Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Yes?
We're going to George.  Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Not a lot.
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
What a horrible little person.
Oh, all right.
It sure was.
There!
Yes?
And leave all this?  Not in a million.
She's trying to find out where she can rent a loudspeaker.
My friend has lost her fucking mind...
You ought to get some new ties, Stewart.
So she can drive through the streets of Rome paging the man of her dreams.
Well, I haven't come around.
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
We'll be all right.
I keep thinking about him.
And may I say that's a gorgeous tie.
If I was Bianca, it would be, "Any school you want, precious.  Don't forget your tiara."
I know.  You're right.
You're wasting your time. I'm already married to him.
Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
Why don't you put me in chains?
I might.
All right! Put me in chains! Do anything you want!  But I'm not going to eat a thing until you let me off this boat!
Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
I'm fine.  My dad said you tore your ACL.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
No, it looks good.  I mean, it's cool.
I was.  I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Sure, Norville, sure...
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
What did you do with her?
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
Occasionally.
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I hate it.  I'm so happy, Becky.  Finally I feel happy.  This is right. This is real.  Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts.  Please don't tell anyone about what happened.  "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I love the symphony.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Hello, Nick!  And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
Daddy, I --
Fuck off.
I'm not hurt.  It doesn't hurt you when somebody pisses on you, it just pissed you off.
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
I understand, Kate.  What do you think of this garter?
If you must know, we were attempting to go to a small study group of friends.
Oh, yeah.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I decided to give you one more chance.  I missed you.
Did you miss me?
Come over here and tell me no.
It's from one of those P.O. Boxes. How was the trip?
Oh, I don't know.  My unemployment checks are running out.  Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
I don't think we have any alternative, Captain.
"4/17: Subject, when unaware of observation, prefers to hold eating utensils...with feet. Successfully carves turkey roll holding eating utensils...with feet."
We have to disconnect ROK's higher brain functions without disturbing his regulatory system.
But that's living like an animal—
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
A little too tight, eh?  ...They were my son’s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy...  I... There’s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you’re hungry.
Right... Well, I’ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay?  Okay. Goodnight then.
Don’t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Give me the ball.
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to...  Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
Yeah.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
What?  You know him?
For. . . ?
Who am I?
It isn't a story - it's true.  I did see Wynant.  He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Oh yes.  Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
What bonds?
I don't like him.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
He's not anybody.  Just a fellow I used to know.
You mean did I write it before my parents died?
Aren't you going to thank me?
A boy kills his parents.  They have a plane.  He makes it look like an accident.
To see if he can get away with it.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's so.
Dr. Ravell's the finest surgeon on the staff. You must know him. He's incredibly handsome, gentle, considerate. He's being sued for sexual assault right now, but --  It's not true. He was set up.
He doesn't want to sleep here.  Neither do I.  It's not my house anymore.
Say goodbye, Mike.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Absolutely nothing.
Okay, you win. Now try to get some sleep, huh.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Oh, Mom!
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Let me go!  Godammit, Frank let go!
It was a place to start.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Frank -- stop it!  Stop it!
I don't want our lives ruined because of this.  I love you, Frank.  I want this to work -- but you have to help me.  You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Yes I am.
Oh, please, I have to go.  I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Hi.  How's she doing?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf.  I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, Elliot, please!  I can't be a party to this!  I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Married.
Oh boy, say, you think you're pretty good.
I know: it's ridiculous. But it's tearing me up and I don't know why. And look, all right, I came here didn't I? And if I have to, I'll keep coming here, the works, and talk about my mummy and my daddy and I'll even pay for it, but will you kindly for God's sakes say something?
I do not love him.
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's.  If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Here.  Be careful with those.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Mmm.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
Not this one.  This one's on me.
Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again.
Twice...
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
God.
Daddy --
Are you relieved?
My heart's in my throat, here. Right off, I have to ask this monstrous favor...
Well, we're...
Please don't tell me "You'll find somebody else someday." Cause . . .  . . . well, you are a pretty hard act to follow, you'll have to admit that.  Oh, I'll get by, don't worry about me.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
You don't think I can do it.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
Kate.  Thank God you're there. I need help.
What a loser she must be.  Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
He's alright.  He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Because I like you so much.  Now I've got to go.
Ha...
Ain't brain surgery.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Nick?
No one's perfect, Kate.
...What happened?
Let me look.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Not only is he a momma's boy and a fascist, he says "nuculear" and "irregardless".
Goodbye and thanks.
Doesn't sound like me.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man.  Says you were jealous and suspicious.
Good.
That's it then.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
I'm sure of this. But not of you.  You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all --  If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Not.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
So why follow me?  Escort me, by all means.  Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Gear shift.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Ah... no...
What?
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel...
I was wondering.
Josh said...
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Does everything have to have a point?
Not really.
That's what she called him on the show.  Because he can't sleep.
And now 2,000 women want his number.  The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Sure I would--but I don't get what you're driving at.
Like what?
Thank you, Louis.
Guess I got a little scattered.
How do you do it? Every night?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night.  Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Westley, what about the R.O.U.S.'s?
You want me to drive for a stretch? Give you a chance to rest.
No, you wait right there for me... I'll be on the Piedmont flight tomorrow at seven. Meet me at the airport.
I won't tell you over the phone. I'm comin' to N.O. and I'll tell you then.
You want to stick around here, Sailor? See if we can get some work?
Seven tomorrow evenin'. We can eat at Galatoire's. Fix it.
How much we got left, honey?
So you're not too different from him, or the chap on the roof, or Tommy-baby --
It got lonely upstairs. There's someone on the roof.
Oh don't be all hypocrite. Or do you really like other kicks? Is it more just having power over someone? -- so you don't really need to --
I mean…Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
The only one?
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it.  Look, houses in which we don't live.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind,/And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, maybe.
Male or female?
Oh.
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
I suppose so.
Whatever.
Uh-uh.  Listen, I'll tell you what. You say I'm wrong. And I say I'm right. So why don't we make a little bet on it?
Bob -- are you making friends with this man?
I wish to be alone.
Yeah.
Andy! Holy shit!
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
A little boy that has escaped from his nurse and--
Ted, get a grip on yourself.  You should never have left the hospital.
Okay. Here it is.  Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
What a horrible death! Do you know what you remind me of?
We can't go back.  We had something very special, but it's all over.
How do you know about my mother?
The word is sick.  Ted -- very, very, very sick.
He still thinks I'm going with him. I'm going to break the news to him tomorrow.
I've never used the word insane, Ted.
Are you going out somewhere?
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Don't explain.
I know.
"To"... Forget about you.
Long enough.
Come on!  I won't tell.
I know.
You pronounce it incorrectly. Ni- notchka.
That is correct.
Your general appearance is not distasteful.
Look at me. The whites of your eyes are clear. Your cornea is excellent.
You are bringing in wrong values. Love is a romantic designation for a most ordinary biological, or shall we say chemical, process. A lot of nonsense is talked and written about it.
She will, Mr.  LaLoosh, she will ...
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
Shit, yeah.  I got numbers coming out of my ears.  Like, for instance, ten.
Sure.  That's one of my numbers.  It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah.  Sexy, huh?  And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is.  Seven is my son's age.  Two is how many times I been married and divorced.  You getting all this?  16 is the number of dollars in my bank account.  454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Oh, don't worry 'bout that...
So maybe one night you got a little too close to the fire... And you're gonna get burned, baby... And besides that, you're shit... D'you think I'd let my little girl go with shit like you?... Why, you belong right here in one of these toilets.
Well, Johnnie told me you used to drive for Clyde and Santos...
No... I just wanted to kiss you good- bye... You know too much 'bout little Lula's mom...
Well, she wants to fuck you.
So you're gonna bitch up?
Oh, it's all right. It's organic.
A little after-dinner liqueur, Harold?
Yes.
He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
Some nuts? Some licorice? It has no nutritional value but then consistency is not really a human trait.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
Well I don't know.
What's wrong?
Pardon?
Like what?
What?
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
Gold nose hair clippers.
For the twins? What in the world is th...
... whatever is manly and independent.
Bad games, bad towns, bad pay, bad flights, bad hotels, real bad food. Homeless, rootless, lonely, maybe your copy gets into one issue out of four...
Want to hear something great? Bobbie and Phoebe are throwing me a shower. It's really gonna be fun.
But he always says...
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
Yes--I remember--
No.
All set for what?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
I'm leaving.  Don't ya see?  If I stay with you like you want me to, there'll always be some guy, your friends eve, treatin' me like that... thinkin' they're allowed to.  What are you gonna do, fight'm all? No.  I'll take my money now, please.
Aw, don't... no...
I didn't think so.
It's not your fault.  You're right.  Kit's right.  But I want the fairy tale.
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
But, David.
David, you don't honestly believe that in reality your friend Jack rose from the grave to breakfast with you? Do you really?
Of course.
Yes?
It's nice to see you.
What is.
What if you stay this time?
Yes.
Well, it was nice to meet you. Surreal but nice.
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
There's something buried there.
You mean the one the dog was sniffing around?
It's just a picture of the backyard, that's all.
Barry said its done.
What about?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
You're a beast!
I can see that.
What're you doing later?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
You're around every afternoon?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
Wow. What a swell place to work.
About an hour ago.
Yes, they are.
Where was she?
Well, it's a tricky turn.
Yes, you're right. We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.
Exactly.
Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Sir, yes, sir!
Get the presents and do the lights.
The one you were telling me about?
No, this one was worse... I had to have the place sprayed when he left. Twice... He was two guys before the last one -- not counting a little office thing in there, which I'm trusting you with, 'cause if it gets out, I'm on the street...
It's lovely... I really like your aquarium.
Yeah, well, at least fish don't use your razor or pee on the seat...
Hmmm. Sounds like you've had a pretty tough go of it with men...
Oh, I dunno... but just once I wish I'd run into a guy who noticed the Koi before my tits.
So what I want to know is why Buddy still calls his sister every week even after she turned him in.
None I'd like to share.
Yeah, let's.
I don’t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
What?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
NO!, He's fine.  Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Mama, I'm hangin' up this phone now.
Changing the sparks.  They showed it on TV.  What d'you think?
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I read the article.  You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.  Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
It's me again.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Oh.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Paillarde of veal.
So now you hate all women?
Sometimes.
Sometimes neither.
There's nothing wrong in liking sex, John.
Why?
Can we turn back?
Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement...
What I mean is --
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this...  ... music.  You know what I'm saying?
I just figured you was out bein' Mr. Cool...
Sure is a big deal round here... Alamo Road, Alamo Street, Alamo Square, Alamo Buildin', Alamo Alamo. They ain't forgettin' about it in a hurry. That's the thing 'bout memory? Some things you wish you could forget... What's troublin' you, sugar?
What?
Your share.
A billion dollars.
I do not love you, my lord.
Just how grateful I am.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
I feel giddy.
I thought eighty was a good round number.
"And this too shall pass away."
Oh, Harold, don't upset yourself so.
Oh! That's wonderful, Harold. Go - and love some more.
Yeah.
As opposed to?
That's how a man would do it.  I'm not a man.
he's just playing, Q...
You gotta good heart.
This is the dumbest thing I will ever do.  So dumb, in fact, that I can't.  I don't think.
You're too kind.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
What was that?
I'll do my best.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
Shhh.
I wrote a poem too.
It would be so okay.
You're already there...
How did he die?
I know who you are.
I got married before, you didn't sell.
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
You don't?
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
But what can you do? There's no way now . . .
Don't . . . it's not your fault . . . you didn't know . . .
If you leave it for more than a few minutes it locks up. Now I must reboot and type a dozen fucking passwords. He was security crazy.
Salots! Shitfucker!
You must not have known him very well. He's not like that.
Bed wetter!
Pacifist!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Sorry.
Yes.  And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
A new invention?
He can stay home.  Please, Dad, won't you?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ...  all of us there ...  your other and me and your stepfather?
This is my wedding.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute.  When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
If you think it'll be all right.
I don't know. Maybe Jerry Jeff sent the heat after us.
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Something too frightful to utter.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I wouldn't dare answer that.
My God!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts.  This can't be right -- con- science.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
And we'll sell the house.
I can't marry you!  I can't ever marry you!
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
God.
Oh-
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
Well, I'm trying to educate him!  It's nothing personal.
Because we're bitches!  Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails.  Please!
Are you kidding?!  You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table!  You don't see that?!
No way.
Adam!  She's got bitch written all over her!  You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Thank you.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative.  My blood type is negative...  If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Should I be?
You haven't looked at the dossier.
I have to call the client and give them a reason why you're late.
I'll call them and tell them you're taking your time. Being a professional.
I'm happy enough.
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Well, maybe I --
I really don't know.
What for?
You shame yourself.
You're forgiven.
Where?
You're totally insane.
Sorry, Pat, out of beer. You like vodka?
Sure.  Uh, Magda, why don't you get some more cheese and crackers...?
Oh, yeah, of course, dear.
Bundt cake?
Must have a sweet tooth. See if you can find some cookies.
Would you like a little clam-dip, honey?
You heard me.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
I'm frightened and confused and I... I think I want to go back to San Francisco where there are buildings and... and concrete and...
It makes you feel as if they're... they're waiting or... resting... or....
After the gulls attacked.
I'm frightened, Mitch.
Yeah.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh.  And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'm going to bed.
I'm plenty happy!
Yes?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me...  Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville!  You married?
Stop it!
Hi, Ted.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Better person than I.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Oh--yikes!
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
I think it’s good to be a little unsure about who you are.  It’s very human.
He begged me to marry him.  I didn't even want to marry him.
I've been dreaming about this.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well—I don't quite know what to say . . .
That's a good, strong name. Do your friends call you John? Or Jack.
What's wrong?
Arlyn was a junkie; I'm not on junk!
As a matter of fact, I thought I might give it to you.
Oh, yeah.
I think you want to go to the west wing.  Through there.
I used to be an actress.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm not.
Oh, Rick!
Where did he go?  He was just here.
Joey.
Hi.
You know Chastity?
Did I miss something?
I have nothing to hide.
What are you going to do?  Charge me with smoking?
What?
Becky?
Did you talk to him?
Okay.  Good.  Goodbye.
That's not what I mean.  I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him.  I am.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
I couldn't do it.  How did I get here?
I hate Sadie.
Don't wake up Vada.
Well it's up to you.  The Big L, or the Big O.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh!
There's no reason why you should.  This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of.  Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
That I am not Rheya.  That Rheya died.  Killed herself.  I'm different.
Sartorius.
Well, lucky for me I found out. Thank God I have friends like Tucker.  Look, I'm sick of talking about stalkers.  Let's talk about you.
I mean he murdered someone and did time back in Boston. The guy's a freak.
I'm going to scream!
Ouch!
Yes! Don't you remember the day you took that Chinese vase from the Royal Palace  and made it into a lamp for my night table?
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
You're pretty drunk.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Why not?
Let me go home.
That's a beauty!
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Oh!
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Thanks, thanks.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Football!
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already.  We don't have to pretend now.
You don't need to do that.
Are you?
Funny Jimmy.  You're so clean and you--this is silly.
You've never said that before.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known.  What was that?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
No, I can't tell you!
Gus?
You know what I'm talking about.
Well ... you were dead.
No, I didn't know that.
I won’t comment on the time but you’ll understand if I don’t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
Oh, you're there. You sound out of breath.
What was that?
You think she's pretty?
Well, she ain't talked to nobody and ain't nobody spoke to her that I could tell. What you make of that?
Mama. I been thinkin' about her. She's prob'ly worried to death by now.
That sounds like horseshit.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Let us cancel the engagement.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
I can't dance tonight --
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance.  I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life.  Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who?
Of course not.  We're just not quick to run and boast.  In case something went wrong.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Way out...
I don’t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
It's not opinion.
Yes.  Not like Enzo.
Where are you staying?
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
No.
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil...  And his drowning was arranged...
Let go!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being.  I'm going for a walk in the park.
You told me I'm safe?  I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what?  I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country!  You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail!  And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Are you sure?
Where shall we go for dinner?
That was read at my parents' wedding.
...they say you're alright.
I'm disgusting.
This is it, then.
I'm not Rheya.  You've always known that.
No, he's out changin' the oil in the car.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Are you serious.
Well... Yeah - okay.
You used the toilet, now you can go - what I do around here ain't any of your business, that's for sure.
Get out.
Well let's get down to it, honey-- how was he?
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo.  I work for an insurance company.  So, I decided to take a few days off.  I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Okay.  I'll try.
But all ends well.
I figured it was.  Where are you?
Hello.
I don't know -- I've got to.
Call me at work.  We can arrange to meet properly.  I don't want this to be the last conversation we have.  I know what you're like.
....shame on you, truly...
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Frank!
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Don't talk like that to him!
Paulie!
It's not your house --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Geronimo is down.
Don't do this.
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him.  I love him, and I don't care what you think.  I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
You know what, Mr. Potter?  I completely forgot your birthday this year.  And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight.  So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
He knows his alphabet.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed.  I got a little something for you, too.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Morning!
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
What do I do?
It's okay - I'll help.  Please.
So I follow the wires?
That's the end of the line.
I'll change and be with you in ten minutes.
Well, no -- I'm sure he was friendly -- to Demi Moore -- who acted with him in 'Ghost.'
I can't say I know Patrick all that well.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Madge?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
My god--
What about you?
He looks familiar.
--You're a cop.
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
Who are you?
Trial?  What trial??
Why are you asking me this?
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
Sir. Excuse me, sir. I'm sorry to have to wake you. Are you a doctor?
We have some passengers who are very sick. Could you come and take a look at them?
... movie.  That's your problem.  You don't want to be in love.  You want to be in love in a movie.  Read it to me.
They knew it.  Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew.  It was right.  It was real.  It was...
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
A hospital? What is it?
You're a basket case.
Wouldn't you?  You're laughing!  I Was sure you never laughed.
I'm exaggerating.
You've met her parents.
Well, sure.
Well, somet...
Well, that's great.  You haven't really had anybody since Dingbat Jennylee...
Really. Just put it there, Harold.
They'd put you in jail, eh? Well, historically you'd be in very good company.  That's what my husband used to say when we were in the French Underground dealing with the Gestapo. Would you like to do a little raking?  Work, I'm told, done with no selfish interest, purifies the mind. You sink your separate self and become one with the universal self. On the other hand, senseless labor is a bloody bore and should be scrupulously avoided.
Danny that's a real _bonehead_ thing to say!
What? With your skill and my experience... I think we can come up with something.
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it.  The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall.  Everyone finally got tired of the fighting.  So they stuck it down here.
See here, can you understand English! I don't want it reported!  Please stay out of my affairs!  I want to be left alone.  A CLOSE-UP of PETER shows him glaring after her.
He will come for me.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
Isn't he the one that always writes about things - only the things he knows about?
I don't know a thing about him, but isn't he the one you're always yelling about?
Conrad.
Did Conrad draw on his imagination?
Didn't he go to sea before he wrote about it?
No. I'd rather you didn't.
What'd it say?
Who's that?
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
It's happened before, you know! Some of the world's happiest marriage have started 'under the gun' you might say.
Her father loading up the shotgun?
Is what you want something you can discuss?
She's only perfect.
People with sense can belong wherever they're put.
You do see me standing here, right?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
It's Alice, ain't it?
The little Brenner girl?
Yes.
Yep?
The little girl's name.
The little Brenner girl.
Alice, I think.  Harry, what's the little Brenner girl's name?
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no!  Yeah, I care.  You used to be so ambitious and...  God, you really liked it?!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that?  H-how did you get over it?  I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine.  Well, you seem fine now.
You never called me back.  I left messages.
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to.  You did both.
You don't have to burst in here every time, Jerry.  Just call and make an appointment.
Because you looked like a nice guy, and I was a little scared. And I sure couldda used a nice guy about that time, so I spilled my popcorn on you.
I'm sure there must be something, but I don't really remember. The only thing that comes to mind are Persians.
Why is he doing this?
Yes. Why is that so difficult for you to understand?
Yes. I loved my husband, Rex.
Vice? Virtue? It's best not to be too moral. You cheat yourself out of too much life. Aim above morality. As Confucius says, "Don't simply be good. Make good things happen."
Yes, so do I. But I think he is a little... old-fashioned. Like a puff, Harold?
Why? There'll be a new block of ice in the morning.
What makes you so sure this will work?
I suppose you're right. But I still don't like it.
I don't know...
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
You know what?
Wait, I know him --okay?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
You could freeze ice on his wife's ass.  She anything like your ex?
Look, Rob.  If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.
I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
The Partridge Family?
C'mon.  It's not that bad
Put your right foot there --
You want me to climb up and show you how to get down?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
He's a nice guy, isn't he?
Tucker, you look different some how. Did you do something with your hair?
No no, the bigger the better.  But I must say, they could be a little brighter. Nothing's sexier than a mouthful of pearly whites.
I'm in the middle.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well...
I don't know what that means.
What?  How could he have?  When?
Ask him.
I'm not in love with him.  I'm in love with ghosts.  And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace.  New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire…  I love that, I believe that.  Who is K?
Please don't creep around this house.
Oona?  Do you suppose it's a faerie?
I can't see a thing.
Clark, stop feeling so threatened every time you hear his name. Nobody expects you to be what you're not.
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone.  My husband...  My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is.  My son-in-law, Carlos...  The gentleman is a business partner of his.
Hmmm... I vonder vich.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
What are you saying?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
Well, have you found it?
The forager's back.
What's with you two?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
It's just so strange...
Oh... Okay.
I lock at you and I see Bill...  I mean, he's almost dead, but he's right here... I mean, you're right here... alive and...
Yes.
Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk.
And he'll talk?
Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown.
Well, this one won't be a chick, will he?
I know. Oh, I know.  I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to...
You said three o'clock.
I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels.  You see, he hasn't arrived yet.
What do you suppose it is?
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away.  O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, not here.  There are too many people around.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"!  Real specifically!  Is that how you see us?
Oh, so loosely.
Ah, Schmendrick -- what's the scam?
Oh zippidy-doo, they'll find my fingerprints.  Can I go in? I need some stuff.
With Trina.
Maybe I wasn't there when you called.
How do you know how bad it was?
Get it.
Nope.
Gotten your mail yet?
Well, tell me.  Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
Why not?
Why do you say that?  Is there something wrong?
But what do, what do you--  what's that mean?  W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Expensive?
Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I don't know.
Me. My home number is on this card.
His home number.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit...  I'm sorry...  forgive me.
Cole, I'm sorry, I...
Bandit two, you read me?
Unless he's dumber than I think, he won't wait 'til his lease is up.
Smart? She'll be arrested!
Okay.  You didn't like the party, huh?
-- really incredible --
What?
Eventually.  Does it have to be right now?
Don’t do that...
STOP IT!  I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
I can't sleep.
Perm?
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
But you eat, don't you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
I kissed him back.
But accidents can happen.
What?
Yeah, once I cut them off.  Why?
Why did she have to die?
Oh, that's a lovely spot, isn't it? I've never been inside. But it looks so lovely, driving past.
Stronger, yes. Smarter, definitely. But you have something he doesn't have.
I'm not a hundred percent on that. God said when the time comes, you'll know what to do.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
You threw him out?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Will it hurt?
What do they want?
From whom?
What is it?
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Why would I want to go there?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
You still mad at'm?
Keep talkin'.  I like hearin'.
Seems like it.  I guess it's easy to get used to, huh?
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
What?!
My mom.  Would be the problem.
And you thought I’d respond to the hippie stripper with no boundaries?
I... I am.  Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
A gull smashed into Annie's front door.  Mitch... what's happening?
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Sure.
I met some very interesting women at the showers. We got to chatting about this and that. You know how time files.
Very outspoken, too. Said I looked funny. Wasn't that cute?
Well, I hope you're not going to dictate whom I can talk to.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What?
Nope - afraid I'm all out of tricks tonight.
Good morning.
Nothing.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
Well, we have to help her!
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
Goodbye, Stew—
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
*Happy*! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going *nowhere*.
Too many times.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
Well, that's something--even if only the fish can see it.
I don't have any money.
Yes.
What?
There's something else I want from you.
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better.  Could you give me a ride to school?
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it.  Psychotherapy.
I'm sorry.
Ah.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We’ll smoke a joint.  Tensions will melt away.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
Why isn't he locked up?
Is that why Klute didn't tell me?
You said someone killed them, you said you know who, you said that.
What was better? I made better bait?
You find any work?
That you, Sail, honey?
I barfed. Tried to make it to the bathroom... Turned out it was the wrong door anyways... I sorta got it cleaned up.
Stuff it, man!
Pat, I'm not kidding. I really think it's the greatest --
I guess.
So...
Right.
And so it is.  I'll talk to you later.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Yeah... Mmmm...
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Everything was different.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Great.
... all of it.  She's leaving her family, her friends, everything she knows.  She's putting her career on hold, and she seems a pretty ambitious, driven, kind of pers...
Duff--
You knew?
What?
Should I whistle down a cab?
Pretty amazing girl, you've got. Make that kind of sacrifice.
Well, there's a problem.
Oh Norville, I --
Pretty strange.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Get away from me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
I’m sorry?
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
Don't be sad, Jack, not with me here to give you cheer.
I should go get some of her things.
By accident?
Lesbian?  No. I found a picture of Jared Leto in one of her drawers, so I'm pretty sure she's not harboring same-sex tendencies.
Who knows?  All I've ever heard her say is that she'd dip before dating a guy that smokes.
I really, really, really wanna go, but I can't.  Not unless my sister goes.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
But I like that one, Scottie.
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
But why?
You *invented* him! You've completely made his up!
This is *your* life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
These *credentials* are against the law!
Rafe --
Then what will?  And what will bring her back?  And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me?  Why didn't he take my life instead of hers?  It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
No, I think maybe you've been right.  I think I may have been too critical in the past.
Will this go on my record?
Kinda. Yeah.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Out of the Army?
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Well, uh...  You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
Sailor?
Don't the reject guys get anythin'?
That don't seem fair.
What's that honey?
What you have to get personal about so quick? All I mean is you could possibly read a book.
I'm sorry, sweetie. I forget some moments where all you been the last two years.
I guess.
I am.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
So what's happening with your book?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
One day you will.
What are those?
Just think about it.  That's all I ask.
You too.
Yes.
Smile.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Minneapolis.
'They won't.'
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
What home?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write:  'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
Eleven o'clock!
It's ridiculous for you to say that it can only be done by a special, private little group of anointed people.
What is it but traveling from one place to another, taking pictures? It's just like being a tourist on an endless vacation.
You can't fit in here -- I can't fit in there. According to you, people should be born, live an die on the same --
Yes.  Are you shaking?
So what a ya do with the companies once you buy'm?
... dollars?
What?  Why?
What are assets?
C'mon, I might buy a company some day.
Sorta like stealing cars and selling'm for parts, huh?
Nick!
Trask said I should move. Let's not make a thing of it.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Well?
You think he saw us?
Yes - and I'd love it.
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want you to move.
I don't think you will.  It's your father's.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then.  I'll tell them.
Now do you believe me!
Well, I've been on a diet since I was nineteen, which means basically I've been hungry for a decade.  I've had a sequence of not nice boyfriends -- one of whom hit me: and every time my heart gets broken it gets splashed across the newspapers as entertainment. Meantime, it cost millions to get me looking like this...
Wow.
Yeah?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
I mean what did we know about anything?
That's what I was going to ask you.  he's disappeared!
Where are you?
Where are you?
Give me an hour.
Did you get a room?
I'll be there in an hour.
Um, news flash: I don’t give a shit.
Of course.  You idiot.  I always wear it. I've always worn it.  I've always loved you.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Well good for you. I bet it works out for you.
It's too bad you don't live down here, Ted.
We've got a lot in common.
Ah, my roots here are too deep. I love my practice, the people I work with, Warren's got a nice thing going  Why don't you just move down here and marry me?
So you're a writer?
Yes.
Now, that's the kind of greeting a girl likes.  None of this "hello you look wonderful" stuff. Just a good straight "who do you know" --
Oh, thank you Lord!  I'm so glad to see you!  I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Give it to me!
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Up to?
Just give it to me!!
Is your brother a flyer?
Vietnam?
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
He did seem a little strange.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
No.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
It's fine.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
So...did my brother call you?
Ok.
Well, stop listening to him.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
That depends what you’re looking at.
Your watch.
Not now.  I don't have time.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling.  I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Oh, we can manage that!  I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
You decide, darling.  Remember our budget.
Oh, Jim!
There's just one thing.  What about--
I got fired.
Hi, Viv.  Carlos, you know my roommate, Viv.
You keep saying that.
So have I.  ... Hello?
I don't know what gets into me.
Be my guest.
Suppose he doesn't come back again?
I wonder where he's going now?
Someone not his wife?
What about it?
Calvin!
I'm scared.
Would you like to walk the rest of the way? It's so nice out.
Uh-huh.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Good morning.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Quite a mess.
Who?
What do you want to tell me?
What is it, Eddie?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
I'm with you, lover.
He did?
Rye.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
That's because you grew up rich.
Four billion dollars.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl --  They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
You're my mother's hairdresser?
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
To keep from being an old maid.
Don't be stupid, Larry.  If he's my destiny, then, obviously, he has to be alive.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time.  Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Look -- I'm sorry -- I've led everybody wrong. I mean yes, I get those feelings, but that's just me, that's just feelings.  I'm sure this will amuse you; I'm scared of the dark. And sometimes I get shook up, I hear people or -- well, I'll come out in the morning and think someone's been prying at my mailbox, or there's a little -- trash outside my door and I wonder if someone left it there for -- do you see? -- things other people wouldn't even notice. Well that's not real, it's just nerves; it's got nothing to do with --
How would I remember?
Most of them.
You're very square. Pimps don't get you dates, cookie; they just take the money.
What did the king say?
Neither can I.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I'm numb.
No.
Damn it!  Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What are you doing here?
I don't see how we can ever find our way back from...
Bye.
Yes.
Whoever sent you, I'll pay double.
You do? You do love me?
Triple!
Is this Mr. Dumbarton?
You like that?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
...but I love listening to you, so that's okay...
Well, I just feel that life'll be much sweeter for you now with me around. I promise...
I remember. You said it to her, but it was meant for me, wasn't it?
School, school.  Regular.  I used to get pretty good grades in school, you know.
What kind of school?
Yes!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
We worked for that money.  We were gonna put together enough to get out of that dump we live in, get off this street.
Is this a May Day pageant?  Are you all off on a lark...?  The raven passed this way hours ago!
True north...  Straight up that pass, through the net.
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Why so nervous?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Is that what you think?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
But you don't have any symptoms!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know.  Cancer, I--
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
How's your twenty?
I'm Kate. You must be Cledus.
I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch.
You dog!
Yeah. I guess. You know --
Okay -- fine.
Andy... I should never have let you go underground. I'm sorry...
That was just perfect.  You've ruined me for anyone else.
I used to live here.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
I don't think so.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
You flatter, my lord.
Forgot your keys --
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling?  I mean, he must have been needing that.
Virginia?!
Yes.
People make mistakes.
Arguing about books.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men.  Too many men. Just like this house.
I don't think it does.  Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
What a fine meal you'd make, be the rest of you sweet as your tongue.
You'll visit again?
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
You want my heart?
How so?
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
The State Theater?
I don't remember.
Pretty girl.
You're a fighter?
Would you call that a portico or a vestibule?
How about -- ?
By the way, how is your father's side?
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Oh, he's sitting up.
But... wait... there are things to say.
You're just a Master of Ceremonies. He might have knocked his head off.
I hope you'll be very happy.
I didn't run away.
Sure. I wish you all the luck in the world, pal.
Yes...
Is he alright?  What happened?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
A name. Grunemann. Nothing. And they showed me pictures like this and they meant nothing. Then they asked me, well had I been getting letters, from someone out there in Cabbageville --
Isn't that sweet.  Well it could be any one of them bubi; I get to see them all.
All right, yes, I had been. Those sick, wild letters -- I'm watching you, gonna follow you, gonna punish you, kill you et cetera. Well, they said, all right that's Grunemann. So try to remember when you and he - when -- well I don't know, there was that dumper once, he sounded like that dumper --  Dumpers; they get their kicks beating you up. A man hired me once, then tried to really kill me - that'd be about two years ago.
No.
I can't have a baby with a man I don't love... And I can't submit a child to divorce.
It's not so bad these days. Kids like joint custody. Two sets of toys.
Maybe.
We do have a man for you.
She's keeping his name. And one of his planes. And all seven of his children
I mean, I want to... I just, I feel strange...
I can't.
Yeah... Bedtime.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
It's cracked -- and you never use it. And it's too ornate. I'm sending up a plain, flat silver one -- with just your initials engraved.
I wanted to, Jeff.  Oh!
What would you think of starting off with dinner at the "21"?
It's opening night of the last depressing week of L. B. Jefferies in a cast.
Open and shut?  <u>Open and fucking shut</u>?
Will we live together?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Do you really mean that?
I am?
Why am I great?
Honey?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Morning.
Good morning.
Oh.
Sixty...  Oh.
Yes. Yes, someone's got to feed them.
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
What?  Hey -- <u>he</u> hit <u>me</u>.
Oh, gosh, I don't know.  Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Hmm.  I think it's lucky I ran into you.  Maybe.
Oh, well.
What's your point?
What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
You wouldn’t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
I'm aware.
Cecile.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
Here's the trouble with never.
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Fuck her yet?
Ted, please be careful.
What?
What are you doing here?
I got a message on my machine to meet Gus here.  Where is he?
No, it's humiliating and you've been doing it since I was a kid.  I don't like it.  Stop.  You may not like having a daughter with problems.  But guess what?  I don't like having a father who's drunk all the time.  I'll eat in my room.
No.  It's my life.
Just stop it.  Don't say another word like that.
What about your bags?
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Could we talk about that a little later?
Thank you.
Get out!
You almost got us killed!
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I...  turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
No one's asking you to!
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
Nothing.
Help me live until I die?
All the time.  I feel like I have no one.
He's still at the bank.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
There isn't any more to tell.
You got types?
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don’t you accuse me of killing my brother?
My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I can't.
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
You asked me what was missing.
But not over me?
Have fun.
Yes.
Thank you.  Do you think I flirt with Cory?
I know.  I think sometimes you just sort of spaz-out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.
Good morning to you, too.  You look good.
You're right -- that is sick.
On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move?
What can <u>I</u> do, Doctor Rumack?
Ted seemed to get worse after I told him about Simon, Doctor.
I mean for Ted.
I want to go to an East Coast school! I want you to trust me to make my own choices.  I want --
So what I want doesn't matter?
Because you're making decisions for me.
I thought you were punishing me.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Is that what he set me up for? Everything he's told me from the beginning? -- don't worry, don't --
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now.  I'm sorry, Grandma.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sure, Mom.  Hello.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
Please. Please don't walk away.
Oh, Kev.
Tonight?
Why you drinking so much?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Paul.
You either.
George! What are you doing here?
Wings?
What is this?
What for? Who are you?
Comrade.
What do you want?
I had to.
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Oh no.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Don't kid me. I'm in no mood for it.
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
Why am I doing this?
What universe are you in, Paul?
Comrade.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God.  Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it.  It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that.  A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose.  And us?  We would have to have "an arrangement".  An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
I want to sleep... forever...
I'm so tired...
What's the use of saving lives... when you see what you do with them!
It was the tower again... and the bell, and the old Spanish village...
He won't talk.
Oh Jesus...!  I'll make some coffee.  They left the stove.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old.  A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me.  Can you make sure you give me a five?  I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I must have nothing.  Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal.  I want to be poisonous but fair.
Years.  This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Suit yourself.  There are plenty of others who will.
Doctor, how long is it going to take you to pull him out of this?
She's mistaken.
It isn't true.  You have to believe me.
I don't use cocaine anymore.  If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Oh, they knew.  They had to know.
Don't give me that.  You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent.  We got those PG&E fuckers by the balls here.
So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
'Course he does.
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Better.
It means you can do anything.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
But it's Christmas now.
NO.
You dance splendidly.
You're trembling.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're crazy.
What are you watching?
Well. As long as it's okay with Monkeybone -
You sure this is...medically advisable?
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you’d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you’re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Yes.  Yes it was.
How long has he been this sick?
Why was I not told earlier?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
It's just a corpse.
Why... I don’t know what you’re talking about.
No, no, no!  I disagree with you completely! I tried it once--
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, <u>your</u> response, to the things we've been discussing.  The number to call is...
M'sieu Laval!
Oh!
When are you coming home?
Yes?
Yes?
Hello.
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
I'm not a theater checker. I'm a call girl.
I'm a call girl. There's a difference, ya know.  I don't know. Maybe there's not. That place you took me to last night, that comic book place.
Clarence, I've got something to tell you. I didn't just happen to be at the theater. I was paid to be there.
Yeah. I got elbowed right in the eye. And if that wasn't enough, I got hurled the ball when I'm not looking. Wam! Right in my face.
Thank you.
Bus hit him.
I know that. I do what I want.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
Where... where am I?
Should we take a walk?  Or maybe some food sent up, or something...
If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento...
Hey, handsome.  Brevity this...
I know.
Hi.
Is that the best you can do?
Too bad.
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college.  We just go right into sheep herding.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I said I'm not listening -- and I think, looking at something that firm, you and your droopy little excuse for an 'arse' would be well-advised to keep quiet.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Maybe you will find out.
Hurry. I'll wait for you here.
I'm not asking you to marry me.
It's more like a date.
Tell me about it.
Really.
Excuse me?
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Here.
Let's not talk about that now.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
It was me, I woulda left ol' Gus on the floor.
I don't have to.  I don't rob banks.
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Bermuda.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Uh-huh.
Mabel, that guy's either the dumbest, the stupidest, the most imbecilic idiot in the world - or he's the grandest thing alive. I can't make him out.
Good night.
I'd like to read it some time.
Well, that's very nice. Thank you.
No - not at all. I couldn't sleep either.
You can't really blame him for being upset.  It was an Armani suit.
I just got a dial tone--
The guy at the desk said he only left about a half hour ago, right?
So, maybe his room hasn't been cleaned yet.  Maybe there's something in there that might help us.  Maybe they'll let us go in and take a look around.
Is it for a child?
Then who's it for?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Nope.
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Oh. I see.
What the hell happened to you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
Not a man.  Ezekiel Walters.
It was my father's.  Kept it in his wallet.  He was murdered --
You sound so sure.
I don't understand.
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today.  Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Mmm, not really. But you're gonna love this one.
But it's a Greenpeace boat. It'd be so easy.
As soon as I can walk.
Miss.
Baxter.
I mean -- her apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
Larry, can I borrow your car keys?
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
Please, Larry.  I have to hurry.
Would you pick one out, please?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
They're waiting. Come on.
What...?
He'll win.
Tucker, I appreciate you doing all this, but I'm really strapped for time here and --
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Right.
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He's just been for a walk.
What's that?  What are you up to?  Nickie - what is this?
Sure.
Sure.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Goodnight.
Sure.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Of course.
Of course.
Here with you.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and  now definitely late--
The hat business is in trouble.
My father can't get our money from the bank.  We have a few dol...
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
You celebrate, Jerome?
The world's gettin' worse, I think, Sailor. And it don't sound like there's much we can do about it, neither.
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
I'm a little tired.
I don't know, George...
You know women normally change five times more than men.
Yes... you know there's a lot of differences between men women.
I'm going to see the Diva sing. What's the matter?... Do I look bad?
I'll explain later--
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Yes, all right, I'll wait for you. Good-by.
These weren't a few birds.
Want to join me?
It's because I don't trust myself with you.  I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
You really want to know?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
Have you tried the duck?
It has bones. Be sure to swallow one.
Make sure it's elevated...
I'm great, good, content.  What happened to your arm, Roy?
I thought you said no more aches and pains?
You humiliated me!
You're not dumb.
I want you to know something.  I wasn't looking for just a fuck, if that's what you're thinking.
Reel it in.  He's only tiny, throw him back.
Big deal, I can do that too.  Thomas J, you got something!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Don't swear...
Italian is practically the same thing.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
There's money in it, Cooley.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
What are you talking about?
Stop trying to be funny, and get ready, will you?
What am I going downstairs and tell those people?
Huh?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure.  You two.
Terrific.  I'm doing vegetables next week.
Yeah.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Sure. Why not?
Were you with Jamie?
A late night or an early morning?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
You sleeping with her?
Hi.
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Uh, hey buddy. Oh boy, am I pissed. You're not going to believe this -- well, you'll believe it, there's no reason not to -- but I just got beeped for emergency surgery. Well, um, sorry, but I'm going to have to bail on you.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I'm late.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Yes.
...You-you spoke to him?
You're sure going to be poison to that Junior Leaguer[4] from now on!
You what?
For heaven's sake, Stew, are you completely bats? What for? I thought the story was cold. You can't go back there.
How is it any different?
Mine.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
Positano is beautiful. Remember when we were there, Rex? We stayed in the Santo Pietro? That hotel on the cliff?
Yes, <u>M'sieu</u> <u>Colet</u>?
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
What?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
I'll be right back.
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything.  And why haven't I done anything?  Because none of you will listen to me!!
Don't they believe in signs here?
I know, I know.
This was my very first slow dance.
Shut up! Don't make up any stories!
I know.
Twenty-eight.
That's not really a very proper question.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have asked you.
My medication.  I left it back there.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Who are they?
Win?
Our doctor's gone too.
How'd you get this?
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
I read the letter.  You read the will. He wants you to keep it.  To live in it some day.
There's more than one kind?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Harmful, like -- how?  What would you get?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
You're sure about this?
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
All our friends...
No.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I'm not hungry.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Do we need words?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
For whom and for what?
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
I took a cab.
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
That's Montana over there.
I'm too old for you.
Looks old.
Wow.
I guess it's getting serious.
Why?
Transitioned?
Why not?
Of course I'm seducing you for Godsakes, and I'm doing a damn poor job of it--  Aren't I pretty?
Oh...  Crash is a very smart man.  Now c'mon, honey, give it a try.
I'm trying to play with your body!
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Excuse me?
When I have something to say.
Won't mother be proud.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
What do you do when you work?
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Sure you are.  You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I just found out.  You didn't say anything to me?  You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow.  Please.
You don't think you'll go --
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
If you come to Hawaii --
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
What are you gonna do when you get home?
I left a message.  I've been dealing with that real estate thing.  I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
This is crazy. I come home, you go to your room. You go in the kitchen, I go to my room. It's stupid.
So what do you say? Can we be friends?
Don't worry, I'm looking... just taking a tiny break.
...okay.
What are those for?
You bet. How much is that worth?
I like you, Jerry.  A lot.
Jerry, I --
What?
Those are song lyrics, Jerry.
If you were eating Kentucky Fried Chicken and drinking Coca-Cola again.
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Out some place.
Oh, she was here.
Always on my ass, anyway.
What?
And the one driving the other car?
Damn, I forgot the jam.
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War &amp; Peace.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Lumbago.
He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman.
Well, that's about to change big time.
Dad!
All right.
Here.  Ti amo.
Other people can't.
No.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD  How many guys were there?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
What is with this school and prom?
Nuke?!
Now don't go overboard, I look incredibly hot, right?
Breathing through your pingala always works, honey--
Where's Ma?
Shut the door, shut the door!
Have you succeeded in your task?
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
You must learn magic.
Then I will teach you.
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
Now don't get upset. Daddy, but there's this boy... and I think he might ask...
You decided.
I know.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Because... I have to be alone!
That's it.  That's it.  That's all I need to know.  Bless you, thank you, thank you.
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
You never know who you'll see.
Looking for someone?
He made you give him a blow job.
Well... not exactly.
Well what then?
No.
Why didn't you do something?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I don't know.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
If that's what you call it.
Later when?
Where's your dad?
At one in the morning?
No.  I shall be out walking.
So it's you he was after!
Clark, everything I was saying -- can't you see I only say it because I really care?
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
You might have mentioned me first.
Assuming the baby's a &quot;Supremes&quot; fan.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Granny's dress.  Oh, Mom.
Is that all right with you?
We... won?!
A what?
I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town?
I can't say I like your seagulls much, either. I come all the way up here to...
I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head!
I hope they fucking fry us all.
Holy mother of God...
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Why?
When you get up to a hundred, wake me up.
You figured that all out yourself, huh?
Here comes a car!
Anita!
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week.  I'm real low on money.
What?
You're joking.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera.  I didn't know what to say.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, he called late last night.
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
And on to a bigger one with you?
How so?
That's a big comfort to me.
It isn't?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Don't you think it's silly of us to think of living there when we have this whole big house—
Wally said to say, "Hello."
Of course I am Stewart.
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
Like you’ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy’s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
How come you’re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do.  What am I really looking at here, huh?  Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney’s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Perks?  Jesus -- <u>perks</u>?
Bullshit.  You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me.  After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
God damn it, Matthew.  What the hell are you doing out here?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
I know. I love that.
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Are you sure you have to go?
I miss you.
Oh, hi.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
I made no request to go out riding today.  How long has he been there?
What?
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married.  At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
How's everything?
So do you.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
What do you mean?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Never mind—I'll get it myself.  Gigolo? Why, you took the word right out of my mouth. Thanks.
You only met him once .
Johnny!
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Honey, you're exhausted.  Do you want to lie down for a little while?
We're still going to be together.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
Yeah.
Let's see.  You could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.
Think I could have them back?
That's my dad.
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
I think they're both virgins.
No.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Sorry.
I thought maybe you'd like dinner.
What about dinner?
Forgive me.  How are you?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here--  --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Are you French?
Can't we change course?
Your career!  What about the lives of those people out there.  Simon, what happened to the man I thought I loved?
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me &quot;Shelly Two Backs&quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
No.
Yeah.
Why did you go?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
How was the dinner?
Hey, don't worry. You'll be fine, Just . . . well, don't rush it.
This isn't a good time to hear your personal philosophy.
But him is you.  Now I'm confused.
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
At my age? Don't be silly.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, no, no... .
I don't like your following me.
Then how did you get here?
This is a place for workmen.
I'm taking my next book to Viking.
I'm moving this book to Viking.
You're going to say it, aren't you?
Well, good night, then...
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
I suppose you gotta get up early, huh?
Fair enough.
I'm not selling anything.  Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
Chris!
I know.
I'll get some.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I couldn't go near that woman.
He's on to something bigger.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
I need an antihistamine.  Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh, my God.  Thank you.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
You've outdone yourself.
I think they're fantastic.
I swear.  I swear.  We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
Maybe she is.
Oh, but they can!
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Cuuuute!
Anita!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Why don't you see Lester?
Geoffrey's not in Cairo.  He's not actually a buffoon.  And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government.  They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia.  In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
I am who I am.  I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are.  I like sex different -- I like it wild.  That's not a crime.  I loved Andrew.  We made love together.  We made it differently, but we still made love.  It was our way.  It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice.  If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
That's ridiculous.
Andrew hardly needed leading.  He was a very passionate man.  He was eager to explore.  I gave him what he wanted.  We fulfilled each others needs.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in.  The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
Jack.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Yeah, you know everything!!
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Tom?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
What are you talking about?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Then what happened?
Help cook?
What?
Oh my God...  You're blushing.
Twenty-two years ago.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
You were in Africa?
Bonjour.
What do you want?
So was my Patient.
You go.
Did he come around often?
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
Mmm. Why don't you go away for a while?
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
-- who's married to --
Don't make an issue of my womanhood. We are here for work... all of us. Let's not waste time. Shall we go?
Happy? Why shouldn't I be happy? I'm getting the handsomest man in captivity.  Here you are, King. Let's drink.  Let's drink to us .  We finally made it, didn't we?
It's up to you now. I want our life to be full of excitement, King. We'll never let up, will we? Never a dull moment. We'll get on a merry-go-round and never get off. Promise you'll never let me get off? It's the only way to live, isn't it? No time to think. We don't want to stop to think, do we? Just want to keep going.
Well, if it isn't the groom himself! You're just in time, King.
I'll be going.  Ellie swallows her drink and starts pouring herself another, as King enters.
I heard about your stunt. That's swell, King. Just think of it—the groom lands on the lawn with a plane. It's a perfect beginning for the life we're going to lead. It sets just the right tempo.  Come on, King. You're lagging.
You don't remember me.....  I'm Dorothy Wynant.
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Pay me!  Before I pick up this chair and smash your face in.
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance.
Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
Who is it?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
Come up and see me... now.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
That's funny--so was I.  Guess the ocean makes one sentimental
It's very tasteful.  I think you'll especially like the zipper in the crotch.  I'm -- joking.
Yes, but carefully. I'd want to know more before committing her to that kind of care.  Scottie --
Mom’s refining her strategy for DDay.
You didn't wake me.  I'll be out of here in a minute.
I have a friend at the magazine.
I recall you.
...from Mavis, also.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
Here. Whenever you want them.
You're angry--
You didn't know?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
Not at all.
Yes, I could.  I have an office in the hospital.
Me?  Internal medicine.
I've got patients coming in --
No one has ever dumped me.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Didn't hear it.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Oh Jerry.
Last time you were gone for a week!
Outside!
I won't have you fighting over me.
Her brother.
What happened to Shelly?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends.  You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
You don't know?  She left thirty minutes ago.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
Anna, I'm Faith.  You don't know how happy I am to meet you.  You see, I'm trying to find someone, and--
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
-- well you better go after her.
Te...!
No, I've been excited before.
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Of course.  When?
I've clung to you.  I've clung to you. Kip.  Life  a raft.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin.  And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can.  A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you.  Benjamin --
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
Well, I need to study, and...
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Life. I said, "life."
Is that bad?...
I think he's having an affair.
Have you seen him with someone?
No...  I can just tell.
After all, he is my brother, and I know he can be kind of a jerk sometimes, but I know him pretty well, and I really don't think--
I'm not going without you.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Shoes?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Can you stay for dinner?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
David?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
When?
I wish they'd stop that.  It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick?  He must be in New York....  Where do you think you're going?
You don't want the fish.
But I wanna write about her.
I was a sergeant in the Third Cavalry Brigade. Would you like to see my wound?
I was wounded before Warsaw.
Don't pity me. Pity the Polish lancer. After all, I'm alive.
A Polish lancer. I was sixteen.
Just what you see. A tiny cog in the great wheel of evolution.
Yeah, I know.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
We all deserve to wear white.
No, no--I'm fine.  Millie, how much time did you and Jimmy spend together before he proposed?
Aw, Christ, I can't take it anymore. I'm gonna pack my bags and go back to my own place.
What are you going to do?
Don't leave me... stay with me...
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
I don't know.  I'm all right.
I love you dad.
Hello.
I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
...Like love...
-- you've got to leave.
Put on your blue suit...
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
You're not going out to look for them?
Oh, I wasn't worrying.  I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Professionally?
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
Actually, Mel does his own ass work. Why wouldn't he?  It's delicious.
You have feet?
Where're you going?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
No.
She did?
Get him!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Evelyn Waugh?
What did it want?
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing.  You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Close your eyes.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Uh huh.  Okay, enough practice.
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Well, I can help.
I don't mind waiting.
Aw, Betty.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I do not need instructions from you to bathe!  I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come!  Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
No. You can have them.
Just for a minute then.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Why do you smile?
Vegas.
I thought Sonny was the good guy.
Wait...
Uh-huh.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Mulholland Drive.
Bottom of the ninth . Mr. Worley. Oh, by the by, Mr. Worley, have you seen your lovely wife today?
Was she married or something?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
I'm getting divorced.
What are you doing?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
What're we going to do?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Why are you so uptight?
We're not gonna do anything.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Do you need anything?  I'll go to the pharmacy.  I have some Demerol at home.
I know. Don't say anything.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
By accident --
You think so.
But Scottie, you don't have to!
Why?  A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
What are you afraid of, Dad?  That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom.  That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Love.  Passion.  Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for.  Well, they've arrived.
“La collectionoose”. It’s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It’s on TV tonight and as I’m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it’s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director’s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Sometimes I do.  Like for two months.
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing...  ...yeah... yeah.
Thing?
What thing?
Hey-
You are very kind.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
Okay, then let's make it easy.  It was a mistake.  Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You gotta get another tour.  We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
Scottie, I need a friend!  Someone I can trust! I'm in a panic about this!
The speedometer of her car showed she had driven 94 miles that day. Where did she go?  I have to know, Scottie. Where she goes and what she does, before I got involved with doctors.
Good morning, Gaston.
It is out of the question. If you wish to approach me...
Then do it through my lawyer!
I kissed the Polish lancer too... before he died.
No, no, the opposite.  That's my best friend, Michael O'Neal. He sounds desperate to talk.
That was lovely!
Well...I used to think that wasn't the worst thing in the world to look forward to.  Lately I'm not so sure.
No.
And?
Really?
It's okay.  I'm game.
I'd love to see your work.
Wow.  Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You still there, sweets?
Then this is a goddamn emergency.
What do you mean?
Little.
A drink.
Praying.
Last night.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Yes.
I love it when your eyes get wild, honey. They light up all blue almost and little white parachutes pop out of 'em. Oh, Sailor you're so aware of what goes on with me? I mean, you pay attention. And I swear, you got the sweetest cock. Sometimes it's like it's talkin' to me when you're inside? Like it's got a voice all it's own. You get right on me.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
I don't know, Kate.  I just said that.  I'm sorry.  I'm just on edge.  I'm afraid we're losing him.
A self-portrait.  But over here is my favorite. It's titled "Rainbow with Egg Underneath and an Elephant." Do you like it?
Really. Do you think it's wrong?
Oh, I'm so happy you said that because I wanted to show you my paintings. This is the "Rape of Rome" and, of course, there in the corner is quite a graphic depiction of Leda and the Swan.
She seemed yare to me.
Heavens no! I don't have the time. But I like to keep in practice and poor Glaucus occasionally needs his memory refreshed as to the contours of the female form.  Do you disapprove?
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Aaah --  -- ello.  You sure they said the management meeting?  They want me to be at the management meeting.
A long time.  I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
I feel safe here.  And it's where I can talk to him.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
The couch, please.
What do you want to know?
What are you doing here?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
You're stupid.  And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Now you got me.
And you love life?
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
Goodbye.
Benjamin?
Will you kiss me!
Oh.  Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh, for her show?
Oh.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before.  Didn't know she owned one.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
What?
Who are these people?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Very funny, smart ass.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws.  My hands fit.
My mother stood on this very spot.
What's he smoking?
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
I was talking about what you could wear!
You said in L.A., anything goes.
Jesus! They're all gonna be calling me!
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
You're right, madame, it will all be over by Thursday.
Go on.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Eeeww!
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Here's my speech...  ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
I feel so embarrassed.
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
Oh...
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain.
Without any clothes on?
Oh, yes.
Will I be seeing you again?
San Francisco's a long way from here.
How does Mother know what I like to do?
Oh. That. Rome.
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
Hi Mr. Bixler!
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War &amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Sure.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
What am I to do with the packages if...
I hate funny exit lines.
Holy shit.  Who do they represent, God?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
How many days and nights do you have to go...  ...here?
Definitely.  'You may show the dent at the top of the artist's buttocks -- but neither cheek.  In the event of a stunt person being used, the artist must have full consultation.'
I could have a stunt bottom, yes.
Definitely.  Ths is important stuff.
When do you have to be here?
How will I do this one?...
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
That's because I speak human, and you speak monster.
You don't get to have me. You are a monster, I'm a human being. We're not going to mate.
I'll hide.
I spent my whole life waiting for a creep.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
What do you mean?
Forever.
When you could've found one in America.
Oh, Peter.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
Not a word.
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
You want me to pick up a painting?
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
Dwayne Pinsley.  From high school. That's how I knew you were here. When you called, from the airport.
How many years did I live with your beams and boards?  First in the garage, then in the living room.  We're going to do it, Robin.  Next year.  Next year.  Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
Funny, Jack.  I’m laughing on the inside.
Because you’ll be here.
Telling my mother she doesn’t have to stay with the kids.
You look forward to this party all year.  What’s with you today?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
Smart, aren't you! So subtle.
I already did.  This morning. When you went running.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Fine.
I don't want to eat!  And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
What's this about not eating?
Absurd!  All this fuss over a snip of a girl.  I'm going down to see her myself.
Why didn't you jam it down her throat?
What are the doctors saying?
I forgot, "Q-man."
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
Stu?
Huckleberry Hound?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
I'm going to spend <u>money</u>.
I didn't ask if it would fit. I asked how much it was.
What is with you?
Sorry.  You're not paying me to ask you question like that.
I've never been on a plane before.
Where are you taking me!?
Huh?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Would you?
Did you?  What's she doing?
You're not going to tell me what she's doing.  I thought we weren't playing games anymore.
She's evil.  She's brilliant.  Be careful, Nick.
I just thought I'd surprise you.  What's the matter?
You still think I kill people, don't you?
Ouch!
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me.  The Easter Parade? You were right.  It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick.  One of his moods.  Although it wasn't a bad week.  He  uh, sold a picture.
She... she fell over backwards.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you.  Goodbye.
Thanks, and goodbye.
It's Johnny Cammareri.
What?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Go back to 316, Bobbie.  The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
We're working here!!  You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
Ah, she's okay.
Well, you'll have a ball. You seem to have everything everybody wants when they go back. The car, the suit, the watch. The look. That just leaves the little things, like happiness, character, point of view...
Thank you.
Ah, Mom.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
This is Roy Ostrey, he's a reporter. And this is Sheriff Ballard. We all went to Fair Oaks High together...
It's not really a good time, guys...
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
Yes, I do.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
I can't.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Lieutenant...
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Excuse me -
He's going back to the front this evening.  I can't see him otherwise.
Betty! Listen to me! Del is ...
What are you talking about?
Tell Del I'm sorry. I left so quick, but I need to do this.
Do what?
I gotta go.
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
I didn't mean to get personal.
Twenty four seconds--as long as it takes the clock to strike twelve.
Got it.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course.  Isn't that right, sweetie.
You sent for me, sir?
What do you do?  What are you doing here?
But I loved the second one she wore. And this one --  -- is beautiful.
Friend?  What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Who's Nina?
Sure.
Ed? How many people live here?
Like diamonds, huh?  I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself.  She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Charlie really has a great voice.
Don't get your hopes up.
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular.  All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner.  And breakfast.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
Stu? Is that you? Where did you <u>go</u>?
Hi, Mom.  How you doing?  Here, let me get you some coffee.  That's enough of that.  What triggered it?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
<U>Gladly</U>.
Good.  That's it...See you.
I am scared. The things I do. The things I could do to you.
I'm still scared.  I mean different but still.  Look, I made it very clear from the start, you're a yokel, you don't excite me, you don't even interest me, and so I only have one question which is what the hell are you doing in my bed?
No, not just 'mm'. You don't know what I --
So what are you doing with a dog?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
God, it's so clean out here.
You were indiscreet enough to leave your gloves in my apartment one evening--  --and he was gentleman enough to boast <U>why</U> you'd been there and show me a snapshot of you.
I think you do.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
Huh?  Oh... yeah.  S'okay?  Uhm... how're... business things going.
Sure! You're never at a loss for words.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
It was nothing.
I'm just saying I don't mind a guy with a bit of a beer belly. It means he's a guy. You can have those pretty boys who hang out in a gym all day staring at their reflections.
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
I hope not.  He's already busted the springs in two chairs.  Hey, what's this?
Oh it's good, &quot;In lieu of&quot; I love that word lieu.
What do you know about hypnosis?
...Huh?
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
No, I...
You just haven't met the right person.
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
In the trunk, yeah?
Apparently not. Don't you know where it is?
Looks like you're the one might go to pieces.
Yes, I do.  Gimme a chance.  I'm stronger than you think.
Sometimes I really hate you.
It was perfect, George.  Amazing.  It was so real.
I know.
Good.
We haven't been away together for three years.  What difference does a few months make?
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
I dreamed about your house last night.
No. Get in.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
Hurry up.
What do you mean?
-- it's $2.99 per minute for the first half hour and $1.99 per minute after that.
And your name?
General, please... if you hear any rumors that I am a charitable person, will you please kill them at their source?
Are they indeed? Thank you.
Yes, General Savitzky?
What'd I say?
What's the matter?
Better than that.
You're upset.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
Yeah, me too, okay, cool.
Welcome to the singles scene.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
Are you going to have women at your party?
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
I think your dinner's burning.
It looks awful.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.
Just local, of course.
Alabama Whitman. Pleased to meet ya.
What's the matter hon? You were great. Terrific. A tiger.
He's cute.
I'm fine. I'm
I just need to lie down for awhile
I know, just let me sleep
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
Like now?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
It looks pretty hopeless... there may be a chance... that's all... The French Government has recognized Soviet Russia and he doubts that they will risk a war for my poor sake. He might be able to make up some kind of a case but it would cost money, money, money!... That's all they are interested in -- those lawyers!
Shhh!  ...But how can there be a question?... Are you my lawyer or theirs?... All right, I'll let you know!
Any others?
Really?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
About what?
No, you don't! Walter!
Of what?
Look out, you --
So... you feel okay now?
Fan-fucking-tastic?
What happened? Did you cut yourself?
You have to be a hero. All Americans think they are cowboys.
Potatoes. He doesn't want me to eat them--  and naturally I don't want to upset him.
Yes.
I...can't.
Nothing.  Why don't we walk to my dorm?
You're not stupid.
She understands.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
Yuri... are you...
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
Just a few minutes ago.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Peter left me yesterday.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Well, not <u>dying</u>, actually. I'm changing. You know, like from winter to spring. Of course, it is a big step to take.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
You're married.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls.  I'll be fine, really.
Listen, you're right.  Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Tomorrow night.  Can you come?
I don't know.  Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Don't look down!
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
How can you watch this crap?
I want to have a baby.
You are something we do not have in Russia.
I will start with you.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Who knows. Remember...  Whatever Walter wants...
What's that got to do with it?
Yes!!!
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
Tell me --  -- is that car parked all right?
Oh, my. We're too late.
Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
He's fallen asleep, as usual.
We'll come back in the morning.
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover...
Me.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
You should not bother with that birdhouse.  If you're leaving tomorrow.
All right. Now finish your drink.
It's all right.
Sit down.
No.
I've never been to it.
I'm meeting someone.
At the Zoo.
Who are you?
I don't know where he is.
He left!  I sprung the dickhead and he cruised on me.
I'll pass the word on, then.
What?
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
In six months, he'll be happy, settled, successful...
He won't get mad, huh?
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Give my love to Shelly.
I will. How's Shelly?
Totally.
Oh, sure. She'd make a beautiful heroine...
'Lo.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Hmm...
Right.  How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
You were reading my Renoir.
It's all just business to you. Him.  Me.  Your life. Everything's business.
It's a place to live, that's all.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
Come on, Jerry.  You know this isn't easy for me.  _ 118.
So what's your job this summer?
Why do guys always know how to hit a woman?  Right across the cheek, wham, so it feels like your eye is gonna explode.  What do they do, take you all aside in high school and show you how? It pisses me off!
It was good.
Right.  You're quite the Sir Galahad today, aren't ya'?  I heard what you did with Kross.
Buddy told me about that thing at Cao Ben?
He's the kind liked it.
That man's a black angel, Sailor. You hook up with him, you'll regret it. If you live to.
Was a massacre. Soldiers there murdered old folks, women and babies, and dumped 'em in a trench. Bobby Peru prob'ly killed the most.
Am I... am I dead?
God defeated the English, not me.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
... You look wonderful...
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I know.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
That's what is know as "manless melancholia."
Oh? You can see my apartment all the way up on 63rd street?
She's not in love with him -- or any of them.
You said it resembled my apartment, didn't you?
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Come up to Boston with me?
I know that.
What?
That's a fine way to behave!
Dad, yes.  And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
That's funny.
It was a dreadful, heavy thing.  I only wore it this once.
How many was that?
I know the difference.  You were in Lompoc USP, the federal penitentiary. I've delivered people there.  So basically you've spent half your life in prison.
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
No.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Good. More coffee?  Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Sleep all right?
He said he stayed here last November.
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
No.
Thank you.
Your dog was killed?
He said he stayed with Maurice.
No.  You take it.
You idiot!  Asta! Stop that!  Get down!  Now, stay there.
Grace? Is everything all right?  Can we talk?
I got this apartment with a guy.
Man, that is love.
No... I don't really know where he is yet. I'm at a hotel around the corner.
'David.' That's your guy. So, you staying with him?
Listen, when someone does the kind of thing you did, you gotta do something in return. So, you stay with me until you find your David and live happily ever after. Okay?
No, that's not, I couldn't...
You can go get your stuff right now. I'll walk you down.
He's in the insurance business.
Can I see him?
We have a baby?
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
Have you ever figured they might extradite you?
You what--?
Probably best not tell anyone about this.
Yes!!
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Don't leave me!
How did it happen?
I've lost my taste for knickknacks--
Father ... Father!
Of course not! I'm a wanderer!  I'd like to go somewhere I've never been!
What am I supposed to do?!  I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it!  I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
And I'm making mine.
What for?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is?  Stay away from it.
This time I'm really glad you showed up.
I’m not worried, Mom. He’s still learning our ways...
Fighting’s a part of it, Annie.  You know that, right?
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
Did I or did I not offer to have it cleaned?
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
I don't think he understood what you were saying.  What's the airport number?
The rest of the world, John, it's not all like St. Albans.
I wasn't saying anything.
Fifteen. You don't know him. He was very kind and strong.
You know, in Russia, there's no work for women. It's a different world.
So?
What? I... I wasn't saying...
But my voices... they promised me...
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Yeah, thanks. . . . I mean, really! Posing as newlyweds to uncover the honeymoon racket in Niagara Falls.  I mean,. imagine wasting a great reporter -  -- uh, reporters -- on this.  Perry White and his Sunday Magazine exposes.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
Get an ambulance.  Don't move. Try to lie still.
Shut up. I'm all right.
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
I don't even know him.  But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
See my hips?
I think Thomas Pynchon's a genius.
I'm committed to Nuke for the season.  You had your chance the other night.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Of course.
Okay.  Great line at the end.
And you feel bad for it?
Excuse me?
Can I ask you something?
But?
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up?
I know.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Thanks.
No buts.  Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's that?
Just one word of advice for next season.
No.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
Paulie, please --
Are these yours?
Oh, please, Nick.
Just once.  Afterwards, I told him I didn't want to anymore.  I wasn't ready. He got pissed.  Then he broke up with me.
I wanted to let you make up your own mind about him.
Why didn't you tell me?
That's not
Is that what you want?
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
I remember.
Yes.
What are you doing here?
I'd love to.
-- his car. They have it blocked.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I insist.  There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts.  Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
No.
I don't want a bodyguard. I want the man I fell in love with.
It's a fucking nightmare, isn't it?
Serafine Flocquet. I work for your uncle.
Oh fuck, you are his nephew...
Goodbye.
Police. They have their head in their asshole and they still can't find shit.
Better get home before it is.
Goodbye, darling.  Don't you dare forget...  December 30th.
Nothing, thank heaven.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Yeah?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Why did you do that?
Nothing's with me.
You'd better not. He's really very dull. But anyhow, when the king tells the marquis he saw me, the marquis will tell the marchesa. And the marchesa is the best friend of the Duchess of Chambro. And <u>she</u> will phone the Princess de Costa. The princess doesn't like me--but I don't care!
Come on sweetie.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Enough?
I didn't know it would get sent.  I just wanted you to... get mad at Kimmy... and...
Yeah, that's clerical.
Intractable, sir. You leave tonight.
And sir, I also get that broken- mirror, black-cat, Friday-the- thirteenth kind of feeling about this one....
I liquidated the last account in Zurich, and split it into two new ones in Estonia.
I thought you could trick me for those tapes. Don't you get lonely in that little green room? Or let me get you someone; I have terrific friends, wild.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Well, you hire illegals--
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
I want to hear you say it.
You're not fooling anybody.
So it's sweet of you to be protective...
Let me rephrase that...
But nothing ever could, ever did, give me a moment's pause about this marriage...
Yes, nice day.  ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Hi. Why are you running?
I don't know.  How do you?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
...What?
What?
Don't worry, it's a long story, but I know who he is.  I know where to find him.
Has he been here?
Colonel!
No it's okay, I understand, really.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once.  I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
That loud—mouthed little bitch~
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
That smart?!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
They've never caught him before, what makes you think they'll catch him now?
Yeah. Me.
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Duty?!  You talk about duty?!
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
It's just as I thought.
Are you really that brave?
The architecture exhibit! My friend Tucker is going to be here. He's an architect, too. You guys will have tons to talk about.
I know he's around here someplace.
Here you go.  What's that smell?
We will, but first I have a surprise.
Is this one art deco or art nouveau?
We just got here thirty seconds ago. Isn't this stuff great?
It was like that yesterday.
Mmm?
With my little sparrow leading team.
And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite!
You have nothing to lose but your feathers.
So you didn't do it after all.
The tennis player. He saw me. He bowed. What could I do? I nodded.  Baron, I shouldn't have come!
Is there no chance?
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Oh-oh. HOLLY  ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions.  She's schizophrenic.
Why?
This is a bad day for me.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Okaaaay....  That car's going to bankrupt you.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
Everybody. Everybody else. I'd be buying my little rainbow at the their expense. All the ones who say "Help. Come quick. Now" I know who you'd have to pick.
I can do that, too.
What?
Naomi, I guess.
Why do you love me?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Okay... I will...
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
Look, John—what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a—
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God.  But I don't think God made man in his own image.  No.  'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men.  No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... <u>Booooorring</u>!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out...  ... Not that we have to get married.
Was that you?
Who did you think?
Yes, I'm glad you're clean but I've been calling and calling.
Yeah.  I just got it.
Carlos.  I still owe him two hundred bucks...
Kit, I left that money for you days ago.
Yes.
Everybody keeps starin' at me.
Yes -- Jane McKenna's book -- I could make a phone call.
NO!
But why?
Me too, Oh, I tried to convince myself, believe me, "It's like being married to a doctor," I said. Doctors are practically never at home. The get emergency calls in the middle of the night and their wives manage to live with it. Then a voice said, " could you be a doctor's wife? Or are you too selfish . . . "
How?
Why?
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Charlie! Am I dead?
His name is John Book.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Yes?
Yes --?
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Why?
What time is it?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Take it easy, John Doe.
No.
I had sex with him for about a year and a half.  I liked having sex with him.
Exactly what do you have in mind, Mr. Corrigan.
I gotta go.  I'll see you at work.  Walter, you scared me.  Don't ever do that again.
I didn't want him meeting me here.
I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me.
Yes...?
Who's Baxter?
I'm partial to oaks, as are all faerie folk.  Mayn't I come visit sometime?
I have thought about you.
You don't love me.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
I'm glad.
She insulted me!
I'll take it. And then what?
Darling, then let's be honest and return it to the lady.
Louie!
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato.  That was nice.
Hi.
Yes!
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Do you think Lother could have seen it?
Will be--as soon as the ship sails.
Uh huh.
Don't say that.
Well, where are you --
No.
This is your bedroom?
Monsieur Rick, I --
Oh, my sweet Westley; what have I done?
You mocked me once, never do it again -- I died that day!
And what am I?
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
They're just fun to read.
Are you married?
So, call me when you --
If you mean Sailor, mama, yes I am.
Are you comin' back here soon, Lula? I need you here.
I'm fine, mama. I just wanted to tell you not to worry.
Why, how could I not worry? Not knowin' what's happenin' to you or where you are? Are you with that boy?
Pardon me? Y'all got a phone here I can use?
It's too late...
All right. We'll dance.
Stop it, Alvy!
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Spanish passports?
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You too.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Will you bring it in to me?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
You did it, Quickdraw. I'm so proud of you. You were like a ninja. Did I do my part OK?
I'm gonna hop in the tub and get all wet, and slippery, and soapy. Then I'm gonna lie in the waterbed, not even both to dry off, and watch X-rated movies till you get your ass back to my lovin' arms.
David! Where on earth have you been!?!
Don't you remember?
The zoo?
You sent that?
Well... thank you. But... you know you're not supposed to be within four hundred yards of me.
I could stay here forever...
You would.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Hello.
-- May I? It's so --
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
Sure we are, let's go!
I can't open it.
What do you want?
You put me life in danger.
Do you want to come in for a minute? We could talk about--
What? Why? What do you mean?
Are you sure you’re okay?
Just in case they don't give you your visa to Russia I want you to know that I have signed a contract for my memoirs and rented a lovely little château in the Touraine, and if you feel the need of a change...
Oh, Faith.  My name's Faith.
What do you want to know?
It's me, Yuri.
No.
Christ, Amy.
Oh, it's you.  It's only Peter.
Are you here to take Shelly back?
Well... you don't look very much like Jack the Ripper...
Sixteen years? Howard Jr. is fourteen and Mandy must be what -- twelve?
Miles, I know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so I'll come to the point. Howard and I are planning to marry.
Yeah.
...And he called the reporters --
You think it's a conspiracy?
You've been my best friend for years and I didn't even know you were out there.
Don't die on me, Jerry.  Okay?
What do you mean?
And you were told to destroy those?
And ...?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
I don't care.
I see.  That reality is a real 'no,' isn't it?
Okay.  Fine.  Fine.  Good decision.
Of course I have.
Michael...
Would you let me ride your horse?
What makes it different, Robert?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
WHY?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
I'm engaged for the evening.
You gave them the eight billion.
Who wants to be first?
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor.  ...And I don't want to examine you.
Then why do you keep running away?
What are you so scared of?
Thank you.
Come on.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
Yeh, well my old machine kept eating messages.  I tried constructively ignoring it in hopes of improvement, but finally...
Ex...ex, ex...
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
I know who you are -- your cruelty reveals everything.
Here you are.
I just don't want to freak him out.
Okay, I got it.
What shit, honey?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore.  What took you?
That's what makes you interesting.  As a teacher.
Nonsense. A man is always ready for marriage -- with the right girl. And Lisa Fremont is the right girl for any man with half a brain, who can get one eye open.
That's abnormal.
That's normal.
You must be kidding. A beautiful young woman, and you a reasonably healthy specimen of manhood.
Behind every ridiculous statement is always hidden the true cause.  What is it? You have a fight?
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
Can I have the boat in about twenty minutes?
Yep.  Could save yourself a lot of trouble. Her name's Alice for sure.
Yes?
That case, I tell you what you do. You go straight through town 'til you see a little hotel on your left there. Not the motel, that's the other end of town. This is the hotel. Now you take a right turn there, you got that?
Near the top of the hill, you'll see the school and right behind it, the church. You head for the school. Now just past the school, you'll see a little house with a red mail box. That's where Annie Hayworth lives, she's the school teacher. You ask her about the little Brenner girl.
Are you sure?
It's Alice.
I need her exact name, you see.
Well, I ain't positive, if that's what you mean.
I'll think about it.
No, George, we've already done that with Lonnie. The blind one last year, remember?
Oh!
Uh, gee.  Would you like to have lunch?  Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
I know, George, I was there. I'm not denying that she's good.
Disney! How inter...
Couple a hours.
Yeah.  Well... I gotta split. Goodbye's make me crazy.
OK, you can turn around!
No, to be honest, I find it dull.
Don't worry about it.  You're my guest.
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
But what about...
It's from Paris.
From Leon.
We saw each other a little while ago.
I don't remember. But off the top of my head, I'd say black.
No... in the hut.
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
Ah, no!!! I don't want to be dressed like someone dead!
And Cannes was quite fun, quite; and we played baccarat and chemindefer and there was a nice little Italian marquis quite enthusiastic for me -- but a young man can be so silly --
If you know where home plate is, then you know where 1st base is, and 2nd, and everything else-- 'cause they're always in the same place in relation to home.  Don't you see?  If you know where home plate is, then you know where everything else in the universe is!
Thurman Munson.  He was covered with dirt and he was fighting with everybody--it was beautiful ...  And he called the ump a cocksucker and got thrown out of the game even though it was an exhibition!  So I stayed in the bleachers all spring and gradually came to understand what's so great about baseball.
Jesus.
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Did you need it?
They're coming!
It's true, It's true!  Least it used to be true.  It ain't possible that baseball's not enough anymore, is it, Crash?
You're terrible.
You working?
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
That's not fair.
We took care of that.
I had a little problem in one store.  I wasn't dressed right. I don't know what to say.  I don't belong there.  Maybe I'll just go back to Bridget.  She was cool.
That's okay.  You seem pissed off all the time, though.
...Old Port Point!  Out at the Presidio! Of course I remember! I often go there!
I lived with you.  You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry.  Isn't that a terrible thing?  Isn't that sad?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Daddy, I want to discuss the prom with you. It's tomorrow night --
I'm kidding.  You know how sometimes you just become this "persona"?  And you don't know how to quit?
Okay -- you're gonna need to learn how to lie.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
This is the first time I've seen him in years.  I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
Kiss my ass.
What?
Come on, what were you going to say?
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine.  It was always messing up.
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight.  You know why?
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
I don't know.  I've just been thinking... maybe this destiny thing is more of a do-it-yourself operation.  Maybe the things that are meant to be are the things we want badly enough to fight for.
Piece of cake.
Hi.  Are you... busy?
Where did you learn that?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where are you going?
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Don't say anything about anything.
Hi, again.  Sorry about...
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
No, you just act like you do.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace.  If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom!  You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
I don't believe this!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true!
Then why do you want to leave?
Did he tell you that?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
I really don't have much of an appetite.
What?
He wasn't always like that, anyway.
You have a lot of secrets.
What's a revival tent?
Will you live here?
No.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Good--then listen.  "I sing the body electric.  The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them--"
You got a list?
Can you prove any of this?
'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'.  'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'.  Oliver Stone?
Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles.  The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
What?
Yeah.  What a day.
Shh, shh...  "They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them, and discorrupt them and charge them"
...I'm here, aren't I?  Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting.  What's on the table for discussion?  Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you angry with me?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that.  When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
One last score, that the idea?  Move to some island.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
I'm not. I just thought I should tell you myself before you heard it somewhere else.
What kind of a guy is he?
-- It's hard to believe this schmuck Kyle would go to such lengths for Coors beer.
Cole, I'm marrying Rick.
Cole, listen to me... I've got to tell you...
That's their explanation.  You might not believe me...
Whatta you mean <u>we'll</u> make it an island?
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
Well, he sort of pitches for the Cosmic All-Stars.
There.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
This is my whole life's happiness. I have to be ruthless.
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Sure.
Thanks.
Oh -- work!!
He was in love with me every day for nine years.  I can make him happier than she can.
Splendid! Is he sick?
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
Apparently, I was hit on the head with something really heavy, giving me a form of amnesia. When I came to, I didn't know who I was, where I was, or where I came from. Luckily, I had my driver's license or I wouldn't even know my name. I hoped it would tell me where I lived but it had a Tallahassee address on it, and I stopped somebody on the street and they told me I was in Detroit. So that was no help. But I did have some money on me, so I hopped in a cab until I saw somethin' that looked familiar. For some reason, and don't ask me why, that theater looked familiar. So I told him to stop and I got out.
Money.
Thirty dollars.
You know what they say
She's got it.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
That'd be something.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Do I look like I have someone special?
Fine.
Well, there's nobody special!
What?
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Meeting ... people.
Oh—Mary—
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
How come you never got married again?
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
I never said that.
What's the matter? Anything wrong?
Yes. I know. Still in the dumps, huh?
I want to be a teacher.
Five hundred wars... Arms... Drugs... Money... Everything you create is used to destroy...
Have you ever done anything like this before?
I do?
I think that’s disgusting.
Not you. You’re not disgusting. You’re lovely. Just the idea that they’d bring an escort. I mean, a stranger who, um, didn’t...who never.... I mean, someone’s dead.
No, I have my things in the car.
No, thank you.
If you don't get out of here, I'll slap that fresh mouth of yours.
I'll find it myself.
Get out!
Are you going to kiss me?
Are you afraid of heights?
At least kiss me when you do that.
Hey, Sheriff. How's everything?
Yes, they are.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
Have you heard of a French film called “La Collectionoose”?
But...
Do you want to go around by the old road?
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
I won?
Where is he?
Where's Joe?
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
For everyone.
Will this work?
I know you just want to punish me --
No I don't.
So you're just going to be vindictive
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
You got to get out of here.  My cell phone's on.  Back in the truck.
I believe you.
I don't have to look at anything. I don't have --
How'd you get the picture?
<u>Why not, Jerry</u>?
Why not?
No no.  Don't do that.  Don't say that if you don't...
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever...  Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
A little, I think... Darlin'?
Come sit by me.
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Hi.  I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me.  Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
Of course not.
Look, she wasn't a relative, okay? I don't know who she is.
What the hell are you expecting him to drive to Vanderbilt for?  Milk and cookies?
Vicky, it's not a space shuttle launch, it's sex.  So did you do the physics write-up?
Jessica!  He'll drive there for me, and I'll drive to Ann Arbor for him. We're going to have sex when he's ready and I'm ready.  It's got to be completely perfect.  I want the right place, the right time, the right moment.
Please.
What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic!
They'll learn to live with it.
Why wait?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Oh yeah?
It doesn't bother me either.
...I suppose.
Let me come and talk to you.
You see?  We're both innocent, Nick.
You know all about me.
You know I don't like to wear any underwear, don't you, Nick?
Why am I here? What happened?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Really.
What'd you do before?  Can I ask?
How long you been riding with Buckaroo, Reno?
Where's Buckaroo?  Is he alive?
Anything I'd know?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
You are not.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
We will separate -- you look over there.
Hell, you just rubbed up against the wrong girl is all.
What you want to watch this trash for? Ain't one of those people have a real thought in their brain.
I wasn't.
So how're you doing?
I don't know... Switzerland?
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So ... ?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
Oh but why "alas?"
Anon, good nurse. Anon.  Master Shakespeare?!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
Glenn?
You don't remember me, do you?
Sure.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Were the lights on?
Oh sure.  This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen.  What's wrong with having some fun?  I like him.
Oh, yes.  It just fascinates me how all    these things work.
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What?!!
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
Three.
Of course not.
Oh, I do that all the time. Whenever I have a few minutes after lunch.
Jeff, you don't have to be deliberately repulsive just to impress me I'm wrong.
Is everything ok?
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me?  If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Here are some blankets.  This is a good song, this is a really good song.
You sound like an artist.
I don't know.  Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear.  Damn!
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
Thank you. So were you.
Healthy as can be.
I thought you were going back to the apartment.
Valo massa... Chacha hamas.
You hand that over to the police.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Then what are you hiding?
I didn't.
That's what you were saying.  I heard what you were saying.
I'm a vegetarian.
Promise?
Of course, don’t be silly.
Yes? No. What?  Save the patter for the tourists.
Not exactly. I wear it.  On my right hand. And only rarely.
What is?
What's her name?
Toy poodle!
Oh, hi hon. Just straightening up.
Where's Puffy?
Ah, he was being a pest so I put him in the bathroom.
Um, Ted, I need a moment with Magda -- would you let the dog out of the bathroom.
Then it's not your problem.
You.  Like the papers all say.
Go away.  Let me rot?
What're you doing here? Why're you looking at me like that?
Was she pretty?
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
He apologized for last night.  Said he didn't know we were married.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see --  -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Two minutes, Alvy.
In the middle?  We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being.  I'm an instrument.  I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what.  Even if I remain passive.  That's when I drank the...  I was going mad.  It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else.  An illusion.  But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood.  Is it like yours?
Oh you!
You mean—  —by the neck or something?
Would you like to go for a walk?
I'll get my hat.
Hey, Sal.
They do something to me.  It's hard to think straight.
I want to stop taking those pills.
But then I would be dead now.
How can you ask me that?
I know what I know.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
He's coming.
Now, what do you see?
I say, to most people it's a washout.
To most people, it's an awful letdown.
There you are. Grant's Tomb. I hope you're not disappointed.
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
You don't believe me anymore?
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Thanks.  I'll think about it.
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh  h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I feel pretty.
Sherry.  Very old, very dry.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
You've got a name, haven't you?
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Warne ...
Peter Warne? I don't like it.
Really?
Ronny!
No.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Not so rough, honey.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, *please*...
Nothing.
It was wrong to deceive you.
But would you--would you--
Nothing like fear of drowning to focus your attention.
So what are you going to do with your share?
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
) Thought I needed a little change.  You like it?
We'd better get back now.
We will?  The Symphony?  Okay.  I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Walter, I'd love to --
Happy New Year.
No!
"Love your enemies"...
Look, Mr. Brenner...
I want you inside me right now.
Book?
We'll KNOW.
If I live here, then he lives here. Fate wouldn't make a mistake like that.  And stop talking.  You're gonna ruin the spell.
I'm home!
Well could I have them back now hon? -- those tape recordings you've got downstairs -- OK? -- and if you want you can have a good time and I'll have a good time and--
You remind me of my uncle.
Just phone calls, right? They ring, you answer, they don't say anything, just blank. Kids getting kicks. Burglars looking for an empty apartment. I mean there is nothing that proves --
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
It's nothing.  Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
No, I'll be fine.  Can you just hand me a glass of water?
I fell in love Miles.
I will, Miles. I will leave. But Miles --
Just listen to me. I'm sorry, Miles. It's true that my initial intention was to...
Hello?
Miles? Miles! Where have you been? I've been trying to get in touch.
You're welcome.
To think -- all that time it was your cup that was poisoned.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry.  Me.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there/And I'm lost in the window/I hide on the stairway/I hang in the curtain/I sleep in your hat..."  Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin/And you spill out/Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Ilene, we don't really know that.
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that.  Anyway. See Ya.
Good night, Duff.
Oh.  Well, for Blackie then.
Hey.
Maybe it's legit.
Maybe! Is it impossible?
Darlin', I still ain't feelin' so well. I'm goin' to bed.
Hi.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up."  Poor fatty never had a chance.
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
Look, the truth is, I didn't want to be dumped at the truck stop. I wanted to go on with you. I needed an excuse.
Yeah.
Like what?
You might have said no. I have trouble handling rejection.
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
I would say so, yes.
This is Mr.--er--
Hey -- do you mind?
But now it's free, right?
Now what?
Too late now.
I'm going to get him, I promise you.
You're being useless. I'm making us rich.
Currency data so we can do optimum conversions at the moment of transfer.
The eight billion. From them to us.
I don't see the connection.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
You take the microwave?
Andy! No!
Because, Andy. It's a cure.
Never eat before the show.
I'm in love with you. How do you feel?
You saw me standing alone ...
Jerry...?  <u>Jerry</u>.
Oh, knock it off! _ 89.
No no.  Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
Maybe you should call her.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Hey! -
Far as you're concerned she's dead, believe it or not.
Dead, dead, dead.
She's dead!
As fair as me?
Is she fair, this princess?
Always, my dear one, never any further.  Love is a child to be pacified with trifles.  A full diet can only kill it.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
You will do as you please.  It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other.  Do you not agree?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
... You know, if you want to be the same old bastard, that's fine.  I can handle it.   But don't pull this 'man of the people' bullshit and then do something like this.
Howard!
I know, me too.  What should we do About it?
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
Yeah, I suppose. But you know somethin' baby, hair does make a difference.
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Yes.
Oh, hello.  Come on in.
Remember, she's a Schuyler.
Who me? She wouldn't want to meet me. I'm just an old load of hay.
It's the smoke.
Do you think your wife would walk up three flights of stairs just to eat out of paper plates?
Not since you broke into society.
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl.  I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
You fucking...
You not ugly.
Promise you won't forget me.
Promise me one thing.
You didn't do nothing.
Marty...
I wish I had your discipline.
Yeah, that one. Somebody who works there arranged to have me meet you.
Annie made them.
We sell a dozen a day in this price range.
Going on right here. It's a big night.
"Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery, for where a heart is hard, they make no battery."
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
George?
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Yes, but where?
Right across the bay there.
Where does he live?
Right here. Bodega Bay.
Do you know him?
Yep.
I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner.
Yep.
I wonder if you could help me.
Try my best.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, no!  It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know.  I don't know.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script.  Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
We don't know who Jonas is.  We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
I don't like it.  Something's wrong.
This doesn't make sense.
-- Understood.
Oh.  Okay.  That's okay.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck?  Just -- for the weekend.
And then I can go home?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
What are you doing?
Just a kiss, right?
But -
I do.  You never stood up for yourself. Ever.  If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I don't remember that.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
Does it matter?
I appreciate your efforts toward a speedy death, but I'm consuming.  Do you mind?
Don't do that!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
He's passionate.
Yes, sir.
What do we do now, Nick?
No dogs, huh? Okay.
When do you need her by?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
I bet.
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
My kids want me to teach them.
I don't like... uh...  Polish love stories...  ... I like musicals.
Got any Ethel Merman?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
I don't like horror movies!
Peter, please...
I don't want to hurt you.
That's my line!
Guest lists of every A-list party on turnover night. They'd be handy to disappear into, so we're invited to all of them.
It's taken me five years at Webber Insurance, nights, weekends, every spare minute, to make this CD. It has all the necessary instructions and confirmation codes to tell their computer to transfer reasonably modest sums out of thousands of those accounts, two, or three million at a crack. Total, eight billion and change.
Peoples China Bank.
Leon hung himself...
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
Oh, come on, Bill.  Don't patronize me.   I'm not one of your little...  Turn around.  I'm talking to you!... Turnaround!
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them.  That was his job.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
It didn't help, but no.  The real problem's on the bottom.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground.  But guess what --
They covered 'em over.  And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
Yes!  And he was such a dork!  And everyone laughed at me, but I didn't care?  Because it was so funny!
No --
Yes or no, Daniel.  If I get him, will you let me go after Foley?
I just got goosebumps.
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
With the compliments of Colet and Company!
Then don't.
You and I -- a relationship.
I love you.
Ted.
What are you doing, Ted?
No.
Is that a good sign, Doctor?
Ted!
I saw you on television yesterday.  You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Peter Kelson?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Let me know.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Why, you need me for the story?
You really are stupid, you know that.
You think so?
Where are you?
No, thank you.
I'm sorry.  I'm just working so hard --
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
Where are you going?
Bullshit.  You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed.  Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I live here, remember?
What?
I'm heading out of town.
A place you've never been.
What are you taking?
I don't know.  Something.  Anything.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Fine.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
Sure.  Ten cents.
Thanks a lot, Ted.
Does that ever happen?
Yes -- cocaine.
No.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh.  When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
What?
Yeah?
Boy, do I know how you feel.  First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me.  Forty God damn percent?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you.  So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Thanks...
Mr. Malkovich?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
What's the matter?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Just take a look at it.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Nothing.
Ohhh. You're in therapy too, Marty?
Uh, no. So you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. The question now is, do I allow you... access... to my being?
It was great, baby. Let's get you to the ER.
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
I know, I know all the arguments, you don't have to tell me. That's what I did all night -- I "listened to the voices of  reason" till the dawn came up. Do you have any idea what a vile sound it to hear the first bird singing when you've been up night crying?
Are you sure they're your friends?
Well, it's over.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Excuse me?
Why not?
Have you had any relationship since?
Sure you do.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I have no doubt that you're a good dad.  You can tell a lot from a person's voice.  But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin.  Brockovich. From the file room?  I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
No!
That's now what I meant...
No...!
Yes, but...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
How bizarre!
Guess who I did it with last night...
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are.  I thought maybe you'd know.
You're not stupid. Just wrong.
You mean she got a bad batch?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
Oh, good...
Stupid.
Yesterday.
Instantaneous.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Why what?
I haven’t thought about that in years.
Did Amy tell you she keeps her Homecoming tiara by the bed?
He thinks people *like* to get whacked by branches.
I know what you've been doing.
You've been giving him a *flying* lesson!
"Maybe you should take the job. And dump the girl."
She’s pretty... See you, huh?
I even moved into Mabel Dawson's apartment - in case old snoopy Cobb might start looking around.
Tonight, maybe.  I'll phone him at noon.  Oh, my lunch hour. I'm a stenographer, you know. Mary Dawson.
With pay!  She is out the door.
I do know.  Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
Arthur!!
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?
But, I'm mean.
The government bonds.  The ones you took from the office safe.
I wouldn't have put it quite that way, but...
...what're you saying?
Yes.
I'd rather not...
Yes... Not the actor, though, the doctor. I think.
Don't worry.  You won't see him again.  What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Francesca.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Sure.
Oh, that's nice.
You too, Diane.
Promise.
Good luck to you, Annie.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for.  Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
What's the matter?
Damn it, child! Now look what you made me do.
Don't give me no trouble now, Pace, please. This ain't the easiest day in a long time. And what do you mean how are we gonna know what your daddy looks like? You seen his photo.
What if I told you not to?
Mama... if you get in the way of me and Sailor's happiness, I'll fuckin' pull your arms out by the roots.
What if I asked you not to?
Wouldn't make any difference.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
<i>Network</i>.  Yeah, she was good.
Nothing.
No kidding. I'll bet you have some very grateful clients. What'd Rex buy you?
From a -- girlfriend.
Oh. And that is -- mom?
Is that you?
You look like you were a very sensitive child. You have expressive eyes.
Sugar or honey?
He fell out.
What are you doing?
You and the other 99% of the women in the world.
Faith, I've seen it already, okay? If I spot somebody who's got a head that's an eighth of an inch around, standing underneath a tuba, I'll recognize him from the photo. Otherwise, I'm telling you, it's not gonna do me any good.
Just once more, so you'll be sure to know what to look for.
You should stay.
Ted, a toilet's not going to kill anyone.
Oh, yes, I forgot: It's your occupation, isn't it?
Thank you.
Don't push me, Duff.
What about that girl?
No. But a small one.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
I made a fool of myself.
What about the notes?
Don't forget your identity.
Paperwork on the Detroit thing. It's a full dossier. Very comprehensive.
But the heirloom ring. Your grandmother's ring...
It looks so...<u>new</u>.
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Do you think she'll be all right?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Good night.
No.
Magic.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
I'd never do that.
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
Well, hi!
Who painted that?
Have you ever tried any?
Kinda gaudy.
Take something off.
I’m sorry I was such a bitch. I really appreciate your doing this.
I can't do it -- I just found out it's his birthday.  I guess I've gotta cancel on Ted.
You vicious bitch, how do you sleep at night?
I— I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's.  Yours is coming out at the elbows.
Today is bath day.
How do you do?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce.  Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
We can digest our-
Oh.
Nice.
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
: Because he's Guy Perkins.  Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Oh I know.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
She recovered.
How did you find out all that?
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
It's a start.
This is strange.  Do you feel it?
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
A hundred dollars!
Roseman Bridge?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
Did you like my friend Frankie?
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can’t you go back there?
Wait, Crash--don't go--all I want is a date.  I'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.
Tomorrow. It has to be tomorrow. Or forget the Mask.
We need to make the trade tomorrow.
You should know, when I come back here with the Mask--if anything goes wrong, a detailed description of everything you've done goes to the PRC.
Excuse me?
Yes.
Mr Denby and Mr. McKinney.
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
You did?
You could pick that scab on your arm.
Well...
Can't you see?
Naturally.  You're going to become a partner in a big institution. It's one of the largest in the world.
Someday perhaps, you might even take charge.
Actually, I think that I...
We're going awfully far.
They were very upset.
What's that?
Lotte, this is so good...
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Ergo?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Me.
Hello, George.
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
It would be a nice change from you.
Then why the sudden exit without even telling me?
When I found out you were going I just had an attack of nerves--a few tears--and Herbert was on his way downtown to get my passport ... so who cares ... I'm here with you ... and that's all that matters to me.
You're a charming liar. You <U>know</U>, Herbert's too dull to be suspicious about anything--even when I suddenly decided to come to Europe at a few hours' notice--
I never want to go back....
Here's to Europe!  Couldn't try to look a little less glum, could you?
All right--but what is there to face? It's finished.
Certainly. Right over there.
Oh, thank you, I knew you'd understand.
Mmm hmm.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Yes, it is.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
If you like.
Are you alright? You lost weight.
Hello, Rex.
And you must be Mr. Massey.
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
Five times a day?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well, you know what I mean.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
Oh, Mr. Denby, I wrote a poem about a bracelet--
Was Jack Goodman your good friend?
Shall I read to you?
A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Samuel L. Clemens. This is after the preface but before chapter one: A Word of Explanation. You all right?
Ahem, A Word of Explanation. It was in Warwick Castle that I came across the curious stranger whom I am going to talk about. He attracted me by three things: his candid simplicity, his marvelous familiarity with ancient armor, and the restfulness of his company - for he did all the talking. We fell together as modest people will in the tail of the herd...
Hi, Ted.
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Well done.
Annette?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You know nothing.  What you don't Know would fill a book.  Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most.  You're never Yourself, you never relax.  Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself.  Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh.  But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt.  I get so cold.  What's between you and that Jew woman?
I wish you'd leave me alone. I want to go away.
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Yes.
It's not that cold. Here, let me wrap it.
"Octopus people?"
If you want to.
That's alright. I already ate lunch. I actually wouldn't mind getting a Gelati.
This town is really going to hell lately.  So what part of the city do you live in?
I think I'd better go home now please.
No.
Will you take me home now?
Till it's not funny any more.  What do you want, Jack?
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Uh-huh?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
How's Pilgrim doing?
Liz is taking care of him.  The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
What for?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I don't know...
How?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You bastard.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Had any schooling?
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
...Hello?
You don't have anything to complain about, Mother. He was all right last night, wasn't he? I told you not to worry about him.
Oh, the usual thing. Blah, blah, blah attended the blah, blah reception and wore the same blah, blah things.
Good morning, Mother. Didn't I tell you that he'd be marvelous. Everybody thought he was so charming last night.
Out to lunch with the girls.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Sure.  Unsnap my stockings.
Yes I do...
That's my leg.
I figure we could work on some fundamentals even if we don't make love.
You were there, Jerry.  Figure it out.
Yeah.  I got it.  No problem.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
It's his heartbeat.
Just not my type, I guess.
Well?
You ever think about going back?
What?
How was your trip?
Here what comes?
Yeah.  Yours is nicer.
What time is it?
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Yeah, what?
Hey, Ros.  Nice view, huh?
See them two big trees across there?
Polo.
The two kids?
I should like to see my drawing.
And then I... right.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Who?
You work too fast for me, young man.
Anythin' interestin' in the world come out of somebody's weird thoughts, Sailor. You tell me Sailor, who could come up with shit like we're seein' these days?
Where'd you play?
Baseball?
I've been looking for him.  Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
How can you say that to me?
I need to confess again.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
You're okay, though, huh?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Oh.  Oh.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
Oh that's great.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Are you learning how to play it?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
I know what I'm doing.  Where have You been?
This is so noble.
What van?
Sure I'm sure.  What is this?
Benjamin?
A water main broke.
Yeah.
If that's what you want.  Yes.
Hi.  You called me?
Well, I might've found him again if I hadn't left Rome to make this pointless trip down here with you.
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that.  Walter!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
Okay, Walter.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
There are lots of reasons.  Do you want to come up?
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy.  If you don't talk to him...
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
You fit another Chanel suit in here?
It's beautiful.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
It's obviously a frameup! They're trying to railroad this man for the money they can get out of him!
No, I'm going home.
I was wondering...  Do you have dinner plans?
Beautiful place...
Been here long?
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
Any night.
I want to go home.
Oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.
How do you like our little hamlet?
I despise it.
Or would you rather I changed the subject?
I think so.
San Francisco.
How'd you happen to come here?
Well, I don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. Unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. It takes a while to get used to.
Where are you from originally, Annie?
I'm marrying your brother!
You don't get along with anybody!
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What did I do?
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Well, you've got it. And there's no losing it. And there's no one to blame. So why quit?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D&D Mattress Man.
No one will know your name.
Juliet!
Who?
Stu - stop it. That monkey is <u>good luck</u>. You thought him up, and everybody loves him, and he's probably going to make you rich. So relax! Enjoy it!
What's the "bad" part?
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
Oh, yeah... Man, I'd love to find that actor just to see the look on her face, watch her bubble burst in mid-air.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Where are you?
Ken.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Yes.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
No, she's talking about your hair.
My father and the Baron.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew.  What was I supposed to do?
What are you doing?
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Wait, don't hang up.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
A magician *makes* magic.  Any fool can use it.
He's no magician.
Did *you* give that acorn its power?
Don't you have it on?
You seem to know what you’re talking about.
It's this big hole.  You could almost see bone.
You'll have to ask him.
Have you ever shot a man?  How many times have you been primary through the door?
You're a caterer?
What if she never starts dating?
But it's not fair -- she's a mutant, Daddy!
This from someone whose diary is devoted to favorite grooming tips?
But she doesn't want to date.
Gus, this --
Thank you.
Oh, Charlie.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it.  I am doing the best I can.
Another raise wouldn't hurt.  And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Well, are you?
I asked you first.
Why?
Making it with my mother?
Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it.  The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
Eight.  That okay?
What's mezzaluna?
Ask her if she knows how I might reach him?  If she has a telephone number?
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Here, pick these up!
What's wrong with you?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay.  Right so far?
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
The city?  New York City?  Why?
Jack...don’t even start...
It's Sue Ann Rogers, Betty Sizemore's friend? I heard from her.
Is this Neighborly Life Insurance?
Mr. Campbell?
Yeah, bring your friend along. I'm sure you got a lot of catching up to do...
I hate him.
The six--
I don't want to <u>stop</u> the nightmare, Hutch. I want to crank it up. I want to take it right off the charts. I want to <u>scare him awake</u>.
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
He's stuck in a loop - a nightmare loop. <i></i> Anybody here know what Oneirix is?
No. I want to give him <u>more</u>. I want to give him a massive dose.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
Perfectly absurd.
That was Thursday.
What?! No, no. You can’t--
Oh, please.  Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Are his folks nice?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
You did say birds?
I'm sorry. I couldn't possibly...
Across at Brinkmeyer's.
Oh. I see.
How do you do, Miss Daniels?  Acknowledge a what?
We don't both have to die.
Here! Come on! Do it! Go ahead.
Shut up! You fucking shut up! What do you want? Huh? What the hell do you want?
Can't you do it out here?
Clever.
Oh, no!
There's no end to your accomplishments.
Morning after?
Well -- she's dead.
Must they always follow us?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
No one's forcing her.
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Now Mother, your attitude is perfectly ridiculous. It's done now. Stewart and I are married.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
Look out for number one. Always number one.  I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you.  No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Test?
Well, in that case...
No, we're paying for the wine.
I'm having the salmon.
That's entrapment.
I don't believe this.
Where's my bag?
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Really?
Mr. Bixler,  I love you.
My God. How I'd love to see that.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Very early in the morning.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
For an hour.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
Why don't you ask for another one?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
You did, didn't you?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
What did you say to her?
I do not marry tonight.
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Doesn't matter.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Mom?
What?
Maybe they should put me down too.
It means you're a completely worthless excuse for a human being, and the fates have all conspired to make you miserable.
Faith, I'm kidding.  Is this how you plan to get what you want from life?  When you finally find it, you turn and run away from it?
My God... you're right.
How much does it cost?
We go underwater?
What have you been doing here!  <u>Huh</u>! <u>I wanna know</u>!  <u>What have you been</u> <u>doing here</u>?!
Really? Is he cute?
What?
What's wrong with me?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
No.
I have never heard one.
I wish they had never met.
On which boat?
Probably not.
Bullshit!  If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
Well, you've got the rest of your lives.
Is he home right now?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
You want me to talk to him?
Perfect.  Sandbag the father.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Seriously.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Well, if you want to get her in the sack, tell her you love her.  That's how I was duped.
She has all the cooking talent.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
What?  You're kidding!
No, no, we decided!
Perfect!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so  we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Why are you doing this to me??  Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I... I was defending myself as best I could!  Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they?  Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so.  I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice.  PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
Bye Aunt Rose.
You know what I'm talking about.
You can't.
Yes.
I know.
Nice, Jack.  You’re sweeping me off my feet.
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
I said... I started.
What did you say?
Well, now you know what it feels like.
WHAT?! How can you --  I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry.  But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
What's the idea?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
I think so.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about.  You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
Why?
-- we are?
What's wrong?
Johnny!  Why didn't you tell me before?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
He's Canadian.
So you can shoot a pistol?
If you said yes I would have had a reason.  You should let me redress those bandages.  Before you go.
Because we're fine here.  I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
There's a man downstairs.  He brought us eggs.  He might stay.
You're a peculiar chap.
Yes, I know—but—
Let me get this straight. You want this thirty-nine sixty in addition to the ten thousand dollars?
The reward.
I'm afraid I'm a little confused. You see, I assumed you were coming here for—
I have several jobs.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I'm worried about you.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
Why do you think --
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Are you all right, now?
No, let's go to work.  Okay?
I will.  I'm trying.  Meanwhile I got some crack left, you wanna get high?
Viv... don't be stupid.  We're whores.
Don't be mad at me.  I'll pay you back.  I promise.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Please, if I start talking --
It's not for the.  They only get to convict him.
Smokey was on our tail. We had to take a detour to ditch the motherfu...
Bandit II. We'll be back on the highway in a second. Over.
Who's Fred?
Miss you, too.  I have been seeing someone for a little while.
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's about the Director.
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes?
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Poor thing.
The answer's no.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going—
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
No.
Don't say it.  We're both ragged out right now.
I did, honey, but that was last night... Let's just find those two kids before it's too late.
Do you get hysterical in small confined spa...
I'm yours.
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
What?  That's horrible!
Shut up, will you?  You sure? Nobody?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
But how... how do you know my name?
About the dumper, didn't he tell you that?
Benjamin?
Let's drop it.
No.
I have my reasons.
Yes.
You waved to me in the elevator.
Damon Bradley...
I can hardly hear you.  Could you spell that?
He's not in at the moment.  Can I take a message?
Hello?  Is anybody there?
I couldn't believe it.  I was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet.  Like if we could take a time-out...
I will do my duty, my lord.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
In the bedroom.
He's here.  Check the bathroom.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Uh...using Josh like that.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
Yes you do.  You know exactly what I'm talking about.  You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm going back home.
All I said in the note was: "Where are you?" That doesn't sound desperate to me.
Oh?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me.  I know Things, Wyatt.  Sweet things.  I Could make you so happy.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You feel bad about this?  About me?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I am going to church.
He is dead?
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
I'm sorry.
In a minute.  When I get it together.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
I'm not telling anyone.
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
You gonna die without a son.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty...
You gonna get married.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
Come on, Mickey.  Come on.
You think?
Yeah.  I guess.
Right.
No. I want to know what you think about besides ditching Smokey?
An existentialist.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
But your face did!
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
What're you doing?
Not around here.  This is a rough part of the world.  Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck.  It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this.  Heck, even our dogs up and die.
For what?
Hi.
No treasure maps, huh?
Michael.
What?
What can you see?
No.
I want to be alone.
No!--Did <U>you</U> take that bracelet?
Refresh my memory.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive.  Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Why not? I need to get in there!
That's okay.  I understand.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Why?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
All right.
Did they ever find out?
With a family?
I'm glad.
And it's all over now.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Us, of course.
Superman! The --
The bomb! It's in there! Any second now, its --
What if it is?
This is serious!  I don't have my license.  He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people.  It's not a big thing for me.
His parents took his car.  They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm coming in.
Do you think I'm strange?
Ah, it's over!  Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber.  I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I think it's because they fear death.
Oh. What about?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Don't shit where you eat.
Get the fuck outta here.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today?  He misses you...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike.  To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep.  You don't have to make conversation with me.
I already did.  I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Jesus Christ!
I'm not making it up. I wouldn't know how. She'll be talking to me about something, nothing at all, and suddenly the words fade into silence and a cloud comes into her eyes and they go blank... and she is somewhere else, away from me... someone I don't know. I call to her and she doesn't hear. And then with a long sigh she is back, and looks at me brightly, and doesn't know she's been away... can't tell me where... or why...
No, it sounds idiotic, I know. And you're still the hard-headed Scot, aren't you? Always were. Do you think I'm making it up?
Then you're of no use to me. I'm sorry I wasted your time. Thank you for coming in, Scottie.
If I told you I believe that his happened to my wife, what would you say?
Is anything wrong? Are you ill?
Leon! What in heaven's name...!
That's all right.
Darling, you're taking my business affairs far too seriously. Much as I'd love to rob the Bolsheviks of their filthy money, I won't do it at the expense of your health. Particularly as we know we won't get much.  You look so pale... pale but interesting.
Don't tell me the bed has lost its best friend.
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh. You mean... today?
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
You are a single mother.  You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I don't have to do what you say.
For how long?
You did, I know you did.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that—eating a sandwich—and with a beard!
We don't have to talk at all.
Are you going home?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- where are you going?
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
We're just having a little drink.
Why are you doing that?
Take it. damn it!
Okay, down boy.  I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
Oh, David... I'm sorry I caused you that much pain.
Oh my God! What's Lonnie doing here?
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Oh, sure okay.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Cosmo's cheating on me.
I need to confess.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
I'm going, Leon...  but before I leave I must compliment you on your gown, Madame Yakushova. Is that what they're wearing in Moscow this year?
Dear me... I must be losing my finesse. If I'm not careful I'll be understood by everybody.
Not at all.... I understand perfectly, Count d'Algout gave you a dog. You made it very clear, madame.
You're absolutely right about the Cossacks. We made an unpardonable mistake when we let them use their knouts. They had such reliable guns.
Exactly. You see, it would have been embarrassing for people of my sort to wear low-cut gowns in the old Russia. The lashes of the Cossacks across our backs were not very becoming, and you know how vain women are.
Isn't it amazing! One gets a wrong impression of the new Russia.  It must be charming. I'm glad conditions are so improved. I assume this is what the factory workers wear at their dances?
A very wise suggestion, Leon. I'm afraid madame and I will never agree.  The only thing we have in common is our lawsuit and that will be decided next week. I understand everything will be over by Thursday. Am I right?
Bye, Daddy! Hope to see you again real soon.
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
Be careful.
How do you like my dress?
How'd you know?
They've started the battle without me!
It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to...
Perhaps I'm old-fashioned.  I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked.
Well...  So long as you know what you want, Mitch.
Yes?
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
I'm not much on rear window ethics.
Uhh, no.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
You're cold.
You didn't even see it.
Ah, let me have a little fun.
Mania.
Well.
But it's your birthday.
Good morning, Dad.
Wonderful. Uh...
Oh, sure. Great.
Hi.
Want me to?
You going to answer it?
Why yes, do you know it?
George...
You're a genius.
You mean... George McCord, the actor?
What's his real name?
Dr. David Ravell.
I'll go to the Hospital.
What if you can't find him? What if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?
Piss off, Merle.  So how you gonna find him, Betty?
Like Rome?
Worse.
This used to be my secretary's room.
No.
Because I don't want one.
Yes.  That will be company for you.
Yes.
He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
Oh, God...
You wouldn't have time anyway.  We come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.
Look, we don’t have time for this right now, we’ll talk about it later.  Now get dressed...  You’re not wearing that to the Thompsons’ party. I don’t care how hilarious you think it is...
Or once.
You know what?  Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Been sending her meals in regularly?
On a hunger strike, huh?  When'd she eat last?
Well, she was in a weakened condition...  I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Happy.  And he won't want to see you.
Better today than tomorrow.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
I'm finished.
Double-crossing swine!
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah, the hair.  Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
Mr. Guild means guests!  Oh, there are two more to come.
I think we may as well sit down.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
Uh-huh.
Liar.
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
Dad!
Dad...
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
What'll it do if they pull the plug?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
I had class.
You want to start going over who they could have gotten?  They can't take on people like this for network news.  For God's sake.  What's going on?
Hey?
I know.  He's wonderful, isn't he?
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
Your little pact.  Jessica told me all about it.  Way to go, Kev!
I came second to the NBA.  I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
Excuse me?
Like I would have art in my suitcase.
Yes. But they don't have a clue.  Why would anyone steal my luggage?
I think it worked out okay, don’t you?
Maybe you’re not.  The Jack Campbell I married wouldn’t need a $2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that’s what it’s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids’ college fund.
Well...Annie for one.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
What?
Yes, it does.
Ahh, look, right now's not very...
Sheriff, I don't...
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
What made you ask such a question?
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Apology acknowledged.
There you go with those moves again.
For what?
Halfway where? You've gotta come home. We've been worried sick about you. Are you alright?
Williams, Arizona. About halfway there, I guess.
Shut up, Merle... Williams.
Betty, honey, listen to me. A man came by from Mutual Life Insurance. He says you've got money comin' to you from Del's policy.  Del's life insurance policy -- Are you with me?
Sue Ann, I thought you of all people would back me up on this, you know what Del's like. How did he take my note?
Damn, Lena...  Who is he?
Then someone was in with you.  Who was it? -- Who was it?  I'll answer that --  Hello ...  hello ...
I never had it.
I don't know, but close.
You, want to blow the whole thing, go right ahead.
This was my first excuse to get away. I can't exactly use my cell phone.
We're getting close.
Look, trust me. I know what I'm doing.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Dartmouth?!
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Credit card.
Put that back.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission –– I mean –– might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir –– and people are beginning to talk.
Sit down? What are . . .
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so.  He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
Why are we in separate--you know, separate rooms?
Way to go, Mom!
You were good.
You were good.
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Richard, take it easy.
I love it!
Joel!
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and  that's this.
It's all right.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
P.M.
No.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
Well, you should. Because I appreciate you, too, you know.
Pointing upwards Look...
You call this... glory...?  All this... this blood... this smell of...
No... not like this...
What are your plans in New York?
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
Shhhh --
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yeah?  Then gimme another raise.
From citizen high to citizen low.
I didn't want to see you again--that's my privilege.
Amazing.
Well, you've asked.
I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I've changed my mind.  That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do.  I will.
About what?
So?
He's my teacher!
Nick, listen.  From Clyde Wynant!  "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
She OD'd, didn't she?
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
You don't mean that Clay.
Tell me, darling.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Whatever, big head.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
You have to say that.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
I gotta be honest with myself and not repress these feelings-I've got mixed emotions-I don't know if I can handle this.  Oh, boy...
Go where?  Where're you going?
Hanoi Shan--?  The guy in your comic books.  Boss of the World Crime League?  Supreme Commander of the Legion of Death?  The Pivot of Mystery himself?  You're putting me on.  He's a cartoon character.
What?  If we just believe in Buckaroo Banzai?
It's a confidential psychiatric record, it'd be illegal --She backs into a wall.  She looks very scared. He comes very close to her -- puts an arm behind her to the wall.
How long do we have to wait here?
I walk out.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
He's asleep.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks.  Sam's working.  I told you Sam was working.  I mean, he really is.
Don't... don't do this... please...
After the kids are back in school.
I'm helping George build his house.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Thank you.
He was on his way to Venice, right? I called the tourist bureau and I must've called every hotel in the city, but I found where he's staying.
College. Haven't really thought about it.
And I love poetry above all.
My God, you have...
At what intervals does he whistle?
Wow. You ever see her again?
What'd she sing?
They must've bought the same map we did.
Please, we hardly know each other.
No!!! No!!!
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Do what?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
Good night.
I don't know if I want to.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Are you sure?
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
I suppose she is very entertaining... It must be lots of fun to be with her, so witty, so glamorous...
She is very attractive. She has great elegance.  She's what you call a woman of the world, isn't she?
Leon, don't ever ask me for a picture of myself... I couldn't bear the thought of being shut up in a drawer... I couldn't breathe, I couldn't stand it.
I'm glad you think so.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
I just wrote a poem about the Atlantic Ocean--
Somebody's got to do it--
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
A better friend.
Yes.
Because from what I've heard, it's a tradition and you're a traditional guy.
I'm not talking about does. I'm talking about hookers.
Cole?
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great.  I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
No!
When?
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
God!  And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time.  I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
Are you sure?
If I've been there? That's silly! Either you've been to a place or you haven't.
How old?
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
I really don't think I need any social advice from you right now.
Bianca, I need to talk to you -- I need to tell you --
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
What?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell!  I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ.  So Satan will assume human form.  I believe it too.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
Okay.
This is the Duchess Swana... I want to speak to Monsieur Cornillon... it's very important... please get him right away... Hello, Monsieur Cornillon? The most incredible thing has happened! My jewels are here in Paris! Three Bolshevik swine are trying to sell them! Yes... yes... we must act immediately!... Call the police... Have them arrested!... Well, then, get an injunction!... But do something, Monsieur Cornillon!  ...But they are my jewels! There must be some way of getting them back!
Thank you so much, my friend. I will get in touch with you.
Rakonin, bless him, has given me the most amazing news!
Why do you bring this up after so many years?
Alexis! Do you know what you are saying?
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
He'll remember my mother for sure.  STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
Well, I wouldn't've if I hadn't thought I was in love.
I was worried.
You're a little too fast.
I understand you perfectly.
Cotton Company --
...weight into the balance...
The iguana.
Yeah.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Just...leave it alone.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
You OK out there?
Thank you. What time is it?
You OK?
I like hearing you talk.  If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
Back.  Neck.  Back.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I could die.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.  I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
I'm serious.
You can't be late.
That isn't true.  It was about your father.  Where is he?
Do you know where he's living?  Oh....  Well, at least I'm glad he's all right.  Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine.  They've replaced you with quite an entourage.  It's a regular "marching band".  You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood.  There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Pretty far.  I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
What is it?
Is that customary?
What do we do now?
Thank you. I've had all the calories necessary for today.
The day will come when you will be free. Go to bed, little father. We want to be alone.
I should say this room is eighteen by twenty-five.
It's delicious, trust me.
I'd just like to pick up a few of my things
On the contrary. We're married and we have no pre-nup, so a case could be made that everything in here is mine.
Comfy!
May I come in?
I want to nail you ass.
You're not listening to me.
About what?
Mom, please.
I can't leave my job, George.
Dad, why are you acting this way?  Is this because of the other morning?
I can't.  Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me.  I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me.  Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say.  I never had that.  Ever. Don't ask me to give it up.  I need it.
You... You found that at Leon’s?
We'll save you a place at our table.
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn’t I hear you right?
It’s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn’t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
Not too quickly.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Perhaps.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke?  I went to Florence once, too.
No.
I don't know.  I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way.  I don't know if it works the same way in this instance.  I don't even know when it's going to happen.
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Superb.
Don't play anything! Dear me. Everyone should be able to make some music. Why, it's life! - Rhythm and harmony - That's the cosmic dance. Come with me.
Oh come on. I'll teach you.
Oh, that was fun. Let's play something together.
Stewart! We're all waiting for you. Where's your valet?
That's not the point.
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Right!
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
To keep out the cold.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
But you're not enrolled.
Yes.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
I'm not dressed.
Ask him his name.
I know what ice fishing is!
Just make it as difficult as possible for you to see her.
Your friends use the pool too.
Why can't you do it?
Hey! That's my line!
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Don't strain yourself.
I know.
What you said.  Make it appear that he's doing you the favor.
Exactly what?
He'll see right through it.
Yes, Gaston?
I wouldn't say anything--I would act.
When it falls off the table and turns turtle--Cute?
Instantly.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink?  I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
You're in over your head.
He's a brave man.
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Hello, Win.
Get your hands up and turn around. <u>Now</u>.
Get out!
Like a popsicle.  They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Tell me I'm fair, as you did the hag.
And am I not fair?
Do I not please you, Jack?
Jest with me then.
Then why do you speak sweeter words to Jenny Greenteeth?
Tell the king to give me more men.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
A job for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
I'm just going to my room.
I hardly know him.  He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
It won't be that hard.
Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry & Vititoe?
Someone's following me.
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
D'you get his name?  Course not.  Jesus, Ed --
Joey never told you we went out, did he?
I wish I had that luxury. I'm the only sophomore that got asked to the prom and I can't go, because you won ' t.
I do care. But I'm a firm believer in doing something for your own reasons, not someone else ' s .
Like you care.
He was, like, a total babe
Why?
In 9th.  For a month
What?
Now I do.  Back then, was a different story.
But you hate Joey
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Go on. Have another try at him.
What's the use.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Is it a girl?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Will you take me home?
You're going to be very disappointed.
Yes...
I thought we were against ownership?  I can stay tonight.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself.  A different life. And here I am a different wife.
You bastard, I was believing you!
I don't think so.  Rosa, I didn't kill Del... they did.
ARE YOU CRAZY?!! STOP IT!!!
LISTEN TO ME! IF I DON'T DO THIS, HE'S DEAD!
You're hurting him!!
I'm massaging his heart. I saw it done once.
What are you doing?
He has no heartbeat!
Read it.
O.K.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
What the hell do I do now?
Not funny.
A film case.
I'm telling you it's a forgery. The paint's still wet for God's sake.
He says they turned the card down.
No, it's, uh... a real big favor.
Never can tell.
But Stoltzfus said...
Father!
No.  Well, her grandparents are down in Oklahoma, but that's it...
I wish I could help you, but I can't.
"A Reason to Love."
What did he say?
Do you have another tie?  Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
Can we go then?
I don't think she will. She's a slut, but I just don't think she's that mean. Jasmine'll bring her around...
I look terrible.
Some discussion.
Don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.
Are we going to build our little house?
Not white, darling.
Yeah.
You are throwing me out.
Excuse me?
I remember you.
He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him!  Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
Lie face down on the floor.
How'd you know my daddy?
That night in the fire while my daddy was dyin'... I saw mama up in her room with Santos...
No, Sailor darlin'. Just shockin' sometimes when things aren't the way you thought they were... I been carryin' a secret too...
No, I don't want any clothes! I don't want anything! I want to get out of here!
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
Joan Collins stayed here.
Who's going to want me now?
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Where do you think you're going?
My car bumper has never held a winning sticker.
He says a dog bit his nose.
I can't promise you anything.
I don't know.  Didn't see him.
You don't think this is just infatuation, do you?
Oh no, I think it'd be great! The Sporting News should know about it.
Damn.
You made it possible for us to get away at a few hours' notice--you never asked why, but I guess you know.
Thanks.
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
No, you tell her.
That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
Not all experiences are good, Bianca. You can't always trust the people you want to.
I guess I thought I was protecting you.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live.  I'm a woman, I like men.  If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady.  At least I'm honest.
I'm freezing to death.
Yes.
Yes.
This is a good one, Mare. Sounds like his partner's all lubed up.
No time, Magda, my show's starting.
Jesus, Mary, you gotta hear this -- some cop's staking out this broad's apartment.
Yes.
I'm just going to get the name of their truck!
All right mystery man. I want some answers. Let's recap. Spring of '84. Two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. The girl sits in a seven-hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. The boy never shows up, until now. So, what's the question?
You know this is adultery.  You Burn in hell for that.
Ilene, why would I want to do that? I trust Rick.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes.  Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
What am I looking at?
They're so untidy.  I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Right.  So!  In town on business?
Simon, what's happening?!
How long will it take you to get home?
Yes.
Maybe she died.
What makes you think something's wrong with her?
A lot of things. She's an invalid who needs constant care -- and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.
There's nothing to see.
She could be under sedatives, sleeping.  He's in the room now.
Maybe he's leaving his wife. I don't know, and I don't care. Lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. Lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. Lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts -- but very, very, very few of them end up in murder -- if that's what you're thinking.
That you're afraid --
No, sir--
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
You know Wilmont?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
So you like bookstores, huh?
But it isn't bad weather now.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Elliot!
What are you doing?!
Did you ever read this one--?
Elliot!  Don't!
I can't sleep.
Stop fooling around... I need to talk.
I don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and --
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
Ted! What are you doing? You can't fly this plane!
WHAT?
Who's that man?
So I see.
Who cares?
What'd he say?
Good lookin'?
Name's Patrick, I met him at the driving range.
Come on, Jonah --
Where are you going?
Oh, yes! The whole thing must have been so embarrassing for you!
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Yeah.  Could be.  Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
Did you?
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Oh, let me go, will you!
Good strategy.
I think he might be worried.
Yes.
How's the mother?
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DRIVE A STAKE THROUGH MY HEART?
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Where is my son?
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
What's his problem?
Better than him.
Do you know the Marquis de la Tours?
No.
Neither.
Go ahead then.
Don't you?
Yes. I was just taking her in some tea.
Yes, I do.
Oh.  Well, I live--
Ohhhh!
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness.  Well, why do you still go to those?  You never tough alcohol.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick.  I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection.  Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore.  It's just...crazy!  I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
Well-well, like what?
No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things.
I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean--
What is it?
Here.
I think so.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
Needing.
No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah, well, lots of couples are imcompat...
Hi.
Subtle?
When are you gonna come clean with your folks?
Don't you see...
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
It could be -- the knife, and the saw.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy—  If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Betty.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah.
No, no. I did.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well.  You didn't get along with her very well?
I don't need you to "stick."
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid.  I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us.  I did this.  And at least I can do something about it now.
It's not fair to you.  This whole --
It's my fault.
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Ted Sheldon.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Honey, you're not supposed to do that.
Oh, my god, you mean it was good?
I know.  I stopped pretending and started liking it with him for real.
What do you know?  You look <u>good</u>. All dressed up.  You clean up real nice.  You sure don't fit in down on the Boulevard, lookin' like you do.  Not that you ever did anyway.
Yeah... I know what you mean.
-- Yes.
Yes -- all right --
Dummy.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
God, you're a slob.
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
I know you don't want help.
Well, you know those cold bitches that work in those stores and try to intimidate you?  It works.
I've got plenty of friends.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here.  Then I'm going home.
Yes.  I didn't confess today.
Exactly.  And he got good.
Coward!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
You're goddamn right I am!
At school. It's Thursday.
Sarah.  Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
I got it all ready. Here.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
The answer is no.  I didn't kill him.
No.  I said I liked Johnny to use his hands.  I don't give any rules, Nick.  I go with the flow.
I'd have to be pretty stupid to write a book about a killing and then kill him the way I described in my book. I'd be announcing myself as the killer.  I'm not stupid.
Yes it does, doesn't it?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her.  She was completely hysterical.  Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I know.  It makes no sense at all.  Thank God my life is in place.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
I don't blame you, Earl.  If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Uh. I'm showing off.
Thank you.  I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Hello, Reggie -- I am waiting for Jean-Louis.
Oh, that.  I forgot I even said th...
You're the coward.
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
It's two weeks.
Listen, I've got to give you credit. Your disguise is nearly perfect. I mean, if you fooled me, and I am nobody's fool --
Because of what I'm betting.  My life.
Yeah.
Help yourself.  Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
Next week "East Lynne."
Oh, you are! Who made you the manager?
You in a dance hall or somethin'? I can hear music behind you.
Need me for what, mama? I'm perfectly fine, and safe, too.
Really, Lula, this ain't right!
Just a place.
Did you run into Johnnie in New Orleans? Lula, are you in New Orleans?
Right?! Mama, was it right for you to sic Johnnie Farragut on us? How could you do that?
Argentina! Lula, you're outta your mind. Now you just tell me where you are and I'll come for you. I won't say nothin' to the police about Sailor, I promise. He can do what he wants, I don't care.
No, mama, I'm in Mexico, and we're about to get on an airplane to Argentina!
No, baby, don't! Can I send you somethin'? You runnin' low on money? I'll wire you some money if you tell me where you are.
I just need to run up and get my bathing suit.
You want a hint?  I'll give you a hint.  You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
GET OUT!!
Who are all these people?
Look, just because you're floating doesn't mean I'm gonna forget about you giving me the finger.
Where downstairs?
You're very funny --
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Of course.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses.  Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Goodnight, Suzette.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
I'm in the bathroom.
Could you bring it up?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
On that chair in the hall.
You can always get another girl.
Well...sure.
This is great, we got cable.
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes.  Do you think that's why we're meeting.  To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
I think what you did...
... was so romantic.
Yes, he is. He's very excited and confused, but he's not crazy, if that's what you mean.
He doesn't remember. He woke up at the zoo.
He's here.
No, why?
Woogie, please, you're starting to scare me.
Woogie, I caught you red-handed.
I'm asking you to leave.
Stop that! No! Somebody help me!!!!!
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
C’mon, Jack, you think there aren’t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I’m doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you’ve seen my pay check.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
I mean...with your car.
So what's wrong?
Rose.
I guess you have.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
It's not your fault.  Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?
What?
Mike, take it easy...
What?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Do what, show you a good time?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
Count d'Algout was for several years my personal representative and if it is necessary to sign any affidavit for him I'll be delighted.
After our talk last night I took it for granted that you would drop in here this morning. Knowing how difficult it is to get into Soviet Russia, I thought I might be of some assistance to you.  May I introduce myself? I am the Duchess Swana of Russia... another Russia.
Hello, Leon darling!
You leave your father to me.
Can it be that easy?
The two guys you were with -- that one, that isn't Maurice Miller, is it? I've seen Snoopy's mug shot and that didn't look like him.
Hm-mm.  Oh, yeah.  I met Phil.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours...  afraid it isn't clean?
Okay.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Oh, man! Who told?
Oh, listen...
I know.  It's terrible!
What?
Miles, how nice of you to see us -- may I introduce Howard D. Doyle of Doyle Oil.
Can I stay a bit longer?
What's the big deal?
Oh.
I think you're different.
No.
Johnny Dancer.  You've been in my office ten times.  How come you never asked me about that picture before?
Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!
Owe you what?
Don't do that again!
What?!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
They fired you?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
You don't have a passport.
No, you can't.
I'm not leaving without you.
I don't think I am.
This story is beyond belief, which is perfect for us. It's free advertising and it's gonna run for months.
'No, turn over 4 TRS's and tell them we need radar feedback before the KFT's return at 19 hundred -- then inform the Pentagon that we'll be needing black star cover from ten hundred through 12.15' -- and don't you dare say one word about how many mistakes I made in that speech or I'll pelt you with olives.
Ted, I don't want to stay here. It's time for us to go back home -- to the plans we made before the war.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Yeah.
Would you?  It's all talk, talk, talk.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Oh, Dad, you're not old.  You'll never be old.
I'm a difficult but brilliant junior officer who in about twenty minutes will save the world from nuclear disaster.
Really?
It's not fair, it's too late. It wasn't supposed to happen this way, it shouldn't have happened...!
We'll never be the same.
I'll have to kill myself before I call him.
He can't do that to me!
I like my name.
The boss is watching us...
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit.  We used to be married.
We know that...
What about?
How far have you gotten?
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
The guy died.
I must say you're persistent--  --it's kind of flattering.
You're not going to print this silly thing, are you?
I'm sure you're quite willing to be decent about this.
Why, he'll be back.
A little.
Gives your circulation something to fight.  What kind of trouble?
You've got a hormone deficiency.
Those sultry sun-worshipers you watch haven't raised your temperature one degree in four weeks.
I knew it!
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way.  But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Oh no. You’ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
How dare you...  You don’t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long it’s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
You've got to do something special.  You've got to make a statement.
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I know it isn't.
Oh, all the time.
Thank you.  I love you.
Don't worry... there will be enough.
Ask me them again. One by one.
Might be from Tallahassee. But I'm not sure yet.
What?
What is this?
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening.  Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on?  Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Bye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Okay.
Let's go home.  Okay?
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Good.  Songs.  What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Want to know what, exactly?
do you listen to this crap?
Then Guillermo says, "If you go any lighter, you're gonna look like an extra on 90210."
What good stuff?
Me.  This endless ...blonde babble. I'm like, boring myself.
Like my fear of wearing pastels?
Tell him I had to leave suddenly. I got a job in China - some place.
Don't do it.
I don't have a clue anymore.  I wish you'd talk to him.  He needs a man.
A man he respects.
It was May, 1934, near Gibsland, Louisiana.
They put a hundred and eighty-seven bullet holes in Clyde, Bonnie Parker and the car they were driving.  Bonnie was eating a sandwich.
And go to confession.
I can't seem to let go of you...
Comfort.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Where're you going to go?
Have I been a good wife?
You're not my type.
Just a minute.
I want you to stop seeing her.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
Are you paying any attention to his jokes?--the first thing you know, you'll be taking piano lessons from Venus de Milo--  Get out of here.
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Come on.
Yes, I *have*!
Yes.
So what do you do the rest of the time?
Good night??!
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh?  Good night.
Uh-huh.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
I made it up just now, and who's asking you?  I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
It's over, Elliot.  I don't know how to make it any clearer.  It's over.  I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things?  How?  They're private!
No, he hasn't.  If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
That's the point.  I'd like to be bothered.
It'll bleed.
Holden Caulfield?  <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
Mickey Rourke, somebody who can appreciate the finer things in life, like Elvis's voice, good kung fu, and a tasty piece of pie.
I'm not sure yet. Ask me again later.
I know.
If you want to. Naturally, we won't talk about anything you don't want to talk about.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
You sure you'll be okay?
I'm sure.  And Kate, thank you for coming.  Thank you for being such a good friend.
No.  No, you go ahead.
I'll be back before you leave.
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Where's he going?
Pigeons... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I know... I know... .
Hey.
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Okay.
Good night.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Put them on the table.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
No?  Huh?  Yes, of course!!
When are you going to open your eyes?
I think that's for the best.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
That's okay, Daddy.
Most men are.
Thank you very much.
<u>You're surprised</u>!... But I guess I just never met the right guy.  Whatta gonna do?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous.  It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
Jerry told me he bit your nose.
What... do you remember?
I see...
Wait.  I have to write this down.
Sorry. I’m a little nervous. I never thought something like this would happen to me.
Well, happen, in the sense that I picked up the phone, tracked you down, flew you here and gave you six grand out of my 401K.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
Yes, I did.
If I go across to Santa Rosa I'll come onto the freeway much earlier.
Yeah, and the freeway's well-lighted, isn't it, Mitch?
Where is the shower?
I can't go out like this.
Yes.  I care about you.  I did it for you.
...Let me get my coat.
I wonder if you could tell me where the...?
Fine.  Wait.
Fifteen million dollars.
Oh... We split up.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
But I don't want to be a lady.
When a lady takes her jewels off in a gentleman's room, where does she put them?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
Oh My God.
It's terrible, no.
What do you do with all this pudding?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
I'm going to be sick. Where's the...
I'm going... I am... I'm going to be sick.
You can't hurt me more than I'm hurt already.
Where's the restroom?
Agent Lowry?
On Norville Barnes!
This rig? Phht.  No problem.
This ain't exactly my most thrillin' notion of startin' a new life.
I'm gonna stay here in this room, Sailor. I don't feel so good? This heat makes me tired.
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Good.  In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink.  You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy.  I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
I can't feel my body.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
And, he's a friend of yours.  It's Dwayne.
I'm engaged.  I'm supposed to be married in two days.
There is one other thing you should know about me.
I feel like I've been wandering in the desert for as long as I can remember.  With nothing but emptiness around me, wind and sun...  And suddenly, out of the blue, somehow I've found the oasis.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What!
Do you want to?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
Yes.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
If I were guilty, and if I wanted to beat that machine, it wouldn't be tiring.  It wouldn't be tiring at all.
Because I'm a professional liar. I spend most of my waking hours dwelling on my lies.  For my writing.
I'm tired.
Thanks.
No...
Oh, now--
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Uh, losers!  All losers!
You're too demanding.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially.  I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men.  There's nothing I would--
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're crazy!  That's not true.
It was late in arriving.  But it's here now.
No!  I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Does everybody have to hear?
Yes --
I suppose I could phone the store in the morning, and say I'm sick.
Jack, I was just trying to help.
Why?!
May I sit down?
Please don't shout.
Then what the fuck did you do it for?
Are you a writer too?
Good for you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Sure.
'Night.
Someone's gonna see us.
Santos... You kill that Sailor, otherwise he's gonna turn my baby against me.
Oh, not for the world!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Then why are you here?
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive.  You father is not who you think he is.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Your son Marty?
Marty.
Who?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
People said she looked like me.
You see how much we have to say.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Any news?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed.  "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
How long is what?
No.
Mutants?!
Did something happen; are you alright?
What did he want?
What happened?
Ok.
Yes... lots of things!
Dad, I'm so sorry.  I know this is a bad time.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
What did you call it?
Then what?
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that.  Was it ever?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new.  Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Have him committed.
I bought a new rug.
Apipoulai!
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
Knock it off, Pollyanna, just 'cause you're in love doesn't mean everyone else has to be.
What?
What was what?
What's with you?
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
Oh, at the dentist's?
Well, then, you must come back and visit.
But it's oat straw tea. You've never had oat straw tea, have you?
Well then.
My door is always open.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
What about that guy you work with, Mike what's-his-name?
You're an accountant for cryin' out loud.
I don't believe in statistics.
What's the sec...
That's really sweet, Ted, but you should save it for one of your books.
Why not?
Ted... you're not that far ahead.
Yeah... almost.  You want to come up and watch Sportscenter?
I want to.
W...
You have no appropriate sense of emergency.  My best friend is ruining his life.
Ohh!
Is it snowing?
It's something.
What happened, darling.  We were so worried.  I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
He's trying.
You've got lipstick all over you.
I'm just as human as you.  I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
What?  Daniel, I wanna go upstairs.
This is our first "date" date.
Who are you!  Who are you!
What do you want!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children?  It'd be fun, wouldn't it?  Maybe they'd murder each other...  keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done.  He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Huh.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
Don't please... I'll do what you desire...
No more... please...
Oh, yes...
What do you want from me?
And then?
What's the profile?
What does Snow think you should do?
... including me.  Right?
You mean,  me?
What have they done to you now?
-- don't you want to --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Nice lines--
What did you wish for, Adam?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
You weren't so bad yourself.
Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
Leave now.
No.  Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Why should I?
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
Goodnight, Mr. Warne.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
Right.
...I meant your food.
Seven and nine!
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing.  Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
How long is this going to go on?
The sign of our partnership.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
We talked about a lot of things.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
Hey--I went to Northwestern!  Once. To use the bathroom.
We have a visitor.
I love you.
Oh, Ted, please be careful. I worry about you so much.
You want to fuck her?
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream.  We never did it when we were kids, remember?  Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Not a very happy poem.
Better.
You hit the ball pretty good for a fourteen.
We should play some time... I mean, if you can afford to lose some money.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
Why not?
You've changed your mind? You do want to play?
Mm? Oh, he was my old man. We broke up.
What? This?
I'm never going back.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
So have I.  But I've never been in love.  Isn't that awful?
Why did you do that?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Yeah, uh-huh.
No.  But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
No.
I don't mean everyone.  Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them.  Or run a newspaper.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
The Park?  It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
We take the Avedon, right?  Simple.
The Carlton's a dump.  No cover.  No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
Would you like a tour?
Yeah, me neither.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Hey -- you let him...
Getting married.
We'd better go before we get thrown out.
Go and ask him yourself.
Yeah...
No, it's okay.  See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
Not for years.
Well, I -- Jerry, the point.  Get there.  What does it have to do with the President?
Motive?
<u>NASA</u> is going to kill the President of the United States with an earthquake.
I can't promise you anything.
Every wire transfer gets rocketed through a series of multiple switches. As soon as each deposit lands somewhere, it's shot somewhere else. It ends up so clean the Mafia couldn't find it.
I know. He told me.
I am.  I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous.  It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
My father's guilty.  He lied to me, he lied to everybody.  I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me.  If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
That bag's almost empty.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Without a love of my own.
You knew just what I was there for.
Why?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Oh -- wait -- oh I get it. You said that just to keep me scared. So I'd tell you everything I -- oh clever; oh you smart, tricky hick.
Don't be silly.
Who are you?
Courage, Jack.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Not even that.
Not one.
No.
Never.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends?  Listen to music?  Masturbate together?  Talk on the phone?
Are you guys' friends?
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
It could have been a squirt gun.
Which one?
Pat does projects all over the world.
Yes, I am a silly girl, for not having seen sooner that you were nothing but a coward with a heart full of fear.
You never sent the ships. Don't bother lying. It doesn't matter. Westley will come for me anyway.
Why not? You can't hurt me. Westley and I are joined by the bonds of love. And you cannot track that. Not with a thousand bloodhounds. And you cannot break it. Not with a thousand swords. And when I say you are a coward, that is only because you are the slimiest weakling ever to crawl the earth.
Oh, Mother!
Why—
A--flack jacket.
Easy.  Slow is best.
Rex. Go away. I don't want to have to sic the dogs on you.
I know, honey.
It's for the party, Dad --
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America.  This is orange, from real Seville oranges.  Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
'Goddam party'!
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Well, it's good that you're there.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
George --
Now, George --
Fine. How are you?
What?
See where I'm pointing?
Where?
Yes?
And the white house?
Yes?
The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner?
That's where the Brenners live.
Nope, just Lydia and the two kids.
Oh, I'm fine.
I wish you'd go now.
I come for my lady Juliet.
I want to go home.
You visiting?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
So he has this huge raging fit about Sarah Lawrence and insists that I go to his male-dominated, puking frat boy, number one golf team school. I have no say at all.
William would never have gone to a state school.
William didn't even go to high school
I don't know.  They've hurt the unicorn.
They just want you to hire some new help.
Don’t worry about it, Jack...
I’m moving to Paris...it was right here...  It’s a box marked “Jack.”  I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Jack...God, it’s been so long...You look...
It’s good to see you...
Is he making any progress, Doctor?
Egypt!
They're mine.  I'm turning in my running shoes to you.
I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that.
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Sure. Come on in.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
Oh, I don't mind.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
What are you going to do?
Everybody's divorced.
The big one!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Sure.
To the twins' soiree?  So they can paw you and drool...?
Sit down, I'll show you how we're going to do it.
Nevermind.  Any five.  So four more.
Is there a difference?
Does anybody live to make a second?
Don't you have a heater?
You're not sleepy?
Thank you.  Where is Mr. Smith?
I was sent from the Post in place of our social editor.
Why, a list of the guests. That's the usual thing, isn't it?
Yes.
Not at all. Have a seat.
Sorry I got you into trouble.
How do you do.
Thank you very much for everything.
Divorced.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
You're married.
Why do I feel I needn’t answer that?
...We’re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
But I do want to.
I'm real sorry, Laura.
A lot.  But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
Walter, you can't do that!
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Must I speak to you in French?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Just go.  It's all right.  Wyatt, Really.  Work well.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Divine ... But that terrible policeman!
But it could have been glorious.
Are you out of your mind?
Don't be defensive.  I'm just surprised to see you.
Dad around?
Okay. Good-bye.
Go ahead.
Monica.  What are you doing here?
More than you love peanut butter?
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Please put it down.
That was him.
I'll give you 100 bucks if you leave right now.
How is it possible?
It made me feel like you could see inside of me.  And I don't know how that's possible.
That's right.
You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her?
This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know.
Have you listened to his morning show, "Wake up with ballplayer"?
Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men...
Truth?
Watch your mouth.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
What you wrote inspired me. _ 79.
Seriously.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
That was you guys, huh?
Come on. Let's go dance.
Better late than never, right?
That's the truth.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson.  And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
He's still got a good grip.  We need to dig more.
Andy...
Yes!
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Look, I can help. You need a sensor expert. You've got one.
I'm so excited, Simon.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
Yes. Could you give me some information?
You, please.
Turn over.
Well--shall we go into dinner?
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
Yes--I met Miss Marsh. In fact, she always seems to be turning up in the most unusual circumstances.  What's the matter, Miss Marsh--aren't you feeling well?
What?
And <U>do</U> bring Miss Marsh--  --when she's had time to tidy up a bit.
You're Anya Rosson, aren't you? I've heard of you back in New York.
I can't.
Dammit! I was so close.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Sock her!
Who cares?!  You hired an actor??
No?  Say, listen—I've devoted a whole lifetime trying to tame that wildcat. Toughest job I ever tackled. Ever hear of J.P. Clarkson? Biggest man in the country, isn't he? Well, I tamed him . Got him eating out of the palm of my hand. I've browbeaten financiers, statesmen, foreign ministers—some of the most powerful people in the world—but I've never been able to do a thing with her. She's been too much for me. I'm glad you think it's easy.  Now listen—if you'll do what I tell you, perhaps I might develop a little respect for you. You never can tell.
No one had to tell me.  He's starring in the local play.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
Get married, apparently.
Day or night?
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
Lower.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Rob!  Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her!  You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back!  And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Okay.  Because you took the trouble to come up here.  And because you've got principles.  But that's it.  I'm not selling them to you one by one.
-- No, no, no, don't even.  I talked to Laura, Rob.  I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds!  Poor Rob!  Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs.  You let me believe that!
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
Kip… I -
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Do you want to come inside?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Sorry.
Andrew loved this old cabin.  He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum.  I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful.  Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind.  I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
No -- not at the office.  I've got a better idea.
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Ha, ha.
What about it?
Commercials.
Where are you going?
I'll miss you.
Please -- please!
More like what happened? What happened, Mr. Blank?
How can I look at you and say this?
I'm heading in to work, baby. Are you sure you'll be okay?
I know.  Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
And if it isn't?
Kate, is something the matter?
Larry brought me flowers last night.
Sure.
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
No...
I leave the answer to God.
I had been sold to the English.  I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I can't read.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
The number.
What would make you think that?
Oh, you look so cute as little Elvis.
Oooooh, you look so cute in your little cowboy outfit. How old were you then?
At the movies?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm having a very good time, too.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
“...but it’s getting there. “
I thought you were living in San Francisco. Or was it Nepal?
I’m worried. Amy’s not good at drinking. She gets sooo drunk sooo fast. Does free alcohol get you less drunk or more drunker?  Is it ‘drunker’ or ‘drunker-er’?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
What happened?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
One time - real late - like about two thirty a.m.? She found Dell up in the black of night all dressed and makin' sandwiches in the kitchen.
Well, like mama told me, Aunt Rootie, Dell's mama? She found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.
One time, Aunt Rootie caught Dell puttin' one big cockroach on his anus?
I better get home.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Oh.
That's too scary.
You fucked it up. Who wouldn't freeze in those circumstances? And I don't care what her problems are. She wouldn't be the first one in that cast with problems. We have nothing to lose by making her an offer.
Why would I give a shit how you feel. And I got news for you. I loved your 'icy water' idea the other day... I'm toying with the idea of killing David Ravell off in a boating accident.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
No, I'm not.  I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just...  Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
No, not at all --  except those are poisonous.
But I want you and Scott to understand.  Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Oh there you are.
Borrow?! This was my dress.  Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say...  Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Yes.
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
Course I am, mama.
You ain't takin' Pace, though.
Six.
What time's Sailor's train get in?
Figure we'll go have supper someplace. Maybe get some barbecue out by Stateline. Sailor always liked that Havana Brown's Pig Pickin'.
Got any plans?
Sailor ain't a boy no more, mama.
Well, you be careful with that boy, Lula.
Really, mama, I gotta go.
Don't mean him. It's Pace concerns me.
Nope. I'm not really a wine gal.
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
My ball, I lost my ball.
She what?
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
You know, this isn't gonna end well, these things never do.
You must see yourself as some kind of Clyde Barrow.
I don't recall his hat, but I've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by Texas Rangers.  Did you know he didn't have his shoes on?
Okay Miles.
You have a very nice home, Miles. Very inviting.
I'm on Sunset. Near the Beverly Hills hotel. Wanna meet me for a drink in the Polo...?
Okay. Should I stop at Starbucks and pick up a blended for --
You have wonderful art. I love that lithograph. Hockney?
They moved it.
Got it.
You wouldn't do that...  you wouldn't!
I sure fall for some weird guys.
Yeah.   He's a good man.
They're crucifying you out there.
You really believe that?
Vaguely...
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
You're my brave boy.
I'm afraid you've got to.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
Oh, honey... What happened?
How did it go?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Your boy.
Missionary?  Penance?  You talk about it like it was a religion.
A dog.
These things you're talking about. You did them to Jerry?
Mike...?
I saw the show.
No -- I don't want anything.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
This is really very nice of you.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
What?
But nothing did.
No... I want to be confessed.
Chill?  Since when do you say ch...
No...
Please... may I have it back...
Oh no? I ain't seen you beaming like this since you broke ninety on the Blue Monster.
Love? Come on, I wouldn't call it love.
An old flame?
Kind of. Ted Peloquin -- one of the sweetest guys in the world.
I called everyone, everywhere!  You just vanished!  You could be dead!
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
Happy bath day.
What?  You talked to him!  Did you tell him we dated before you were a priest?
What did he ask?
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Jack!...  Jack!
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
It's my dad. He worries.  Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
It's me.
Rosa...
I am lonely, Yuri.
Puffy, get over here.
Tell me about yourself.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- yes.
Thank you.  Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
They're different, Daddy.  Thank you.  I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them.  Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right.  No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope...  I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
Hmm-mmm.
Aren't you eating?
At a time like this that's all you can think to say? "Gently?"
He never told me.
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Thank you.  Will you bury Geoffrey?  I know he's dead.
I know.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France.  The Devil's Chimney it was called -  The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why.  Darling.  My darling.
Good night.
Yes--is it all right if I come like this?
How can you, how can you say that?
But the same song.  I think it's fantastic!
There's food in the fridge. I won't be long.
Okay, look, I'm delivering this to a man who's going to give us the key to our job. But it's pointless to try to explain it yet. You just have to trust me. I don't have any more secrets.
I told you. It's the down payment. And thanks to you it's overdue.
Where did you disappear to?
No, no he's not.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
The Golden Warriors.
Try. Do me a favor. Try. It's your only chance. And hers, too. Do that for me—and maybe we'll be friends—  Maybe.  Do we understand each other?
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
You never finished the one about the two Scotchmen with the names.
What do you feed him?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Does he bite?
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know?  I mean...  I'm able to enjoy people more.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
He knew what he was doing.  Nobody forced him to rob banks.
Why doesn't Dexter show some decency? And you might show some too, Mother. What do you expect a man to do when he's called such names?  I'm glad you hit that reporter, Stewart. He deserved it.
Dexter.
Then what's love?
Where?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have.  Same with guys.  That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
You didn't get "lured".  Women never get lured.  They're too strong and powerful for that. Now say it--"I didn't get lured and I will take responsibility for my actions".
Three-fourteen?  Hmmm...  Look't those thighs, Jackson
--Millie, you've got to stay out of the clubhouse.  It'll just get everybody in trouble.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
We're not going out tonight.
I drove over and you were gone.
What was I supposed to do?  When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all.  Well, you look nice.
And also that...
Don't you hate people that surprise you? ... I do.  We can't stand here.
Any woman's crazy to feel about a man the way I do about you.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
...T-thank you.
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
Jimmy!
What's the matter?
He's a swell person. He told me he'd rather turn one guy straight than jug a million.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
Really?  Is the food that bad?
I'm not kidding.
Only a few.  A few.  Do you like 'em?
You take care, Dorie.
What are you thinking?
Were.  Isn't that what you mean?  Were. Because he's dead, isn't he?  And that's why you've come.
He told me about you.  That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
Well, think about it.
Believe me, that won't be a problem.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
That's not just a works bill you vetoed -- that would have given these kids homes...  ... When I think about that little spectacle you pulled with those muppets and that magic trick...
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.  Cheers.
Mother!
Don't be silly.  How's a psychiatrist gonna find him?
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know.  Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism.  We love you. We're grateful."
Howard.
Don't leave me now.  I fear the unicorn won't show himself without you.
I've lost my napkin.  It was all elf-work and lace... I must have dropped it when you startled me so.
Oh, dear.
What shall we do?
The napkin will keep.  I'd rather not be alone.
Why did you hate me?
I promise, Jack...
It’s been interesting, that’s for sure.
You’ve been Jack Campbell.  And that’s always a good thing...
Are you okay, Jack?
I can't help it.  You don't know.....
You're grateful, but you resent me.
My perfume?
No, I couldn't.
You have a dog? What kind?
What?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Where is the car?
Who?
No.  I told you everything, you lied to me.  I would have done anything for you.
I'm so ashamed dad.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
You look so beautiful.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
To go up.
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
Like a detective.
Oh, it just came to me one day.
No I don't.
That was really sweet...
I beg your pardon?
Have a nice day.
Maybe... look -- just...
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Why don't you go lie down?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
You've got to stop doing that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
Really?
No, it's my fault, I thought this would all be over by now.  I just wanted to sort of apologize for the kissing thing.  I seriously don't know what got in to me.  I just wanted to make sure you were fine about it.
That was just so... awful!
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
No.
Don't.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Have you tried these?  These are wonderful.  Holly and her friend made them.
Oh she's a beauty.
Yo ho ho!
Fabric and fringe.
Honey, I could sit...
I'm sorry. I'm squishing you. I'll move to the...
Well, I suppose I could "girly" it up for you with a little Fortuny, and some passementerie --
Hardly. You have six bedrooms
I was safe when you found me, there was nothing you could prove! But when I saw you again I couldn't run away, I loved you so! I walked into danger and let you change me again because I loved you and wanted you!  Scottie, please! You love me now! Love me! Keep me safe!
Well, I'm the neighbors.  There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
What are you going to do?
I'm so proud of you and all the guys.  Want some more soup?
How 'bout a back rub?
I'll tuck you in.
I'm not gonna try to seduce you, sweetie...
Like hell you will.  You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.
You.
Yes. But not as a date date.
I'm not allowed to date.
I'm really sorry about last time.  He just flew in -- I had no idea -- in fact, I had no idea if he'd ever fly in again.
I don't know.  It got to the point where I couldn't remember any of the reasons I loved him.  And you... and love?
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
I have.
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
George...
Ummm?
Forget it. This is one of the longest relationships I've ever had. I'm not blowing it now.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house.  Was it --
I got drunk.  I puked.  I got rejected. It was big fun.
You didn't
Hi.
<u>Settle down</u>?  I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry!  I can't <u>afford</u> to settle down!
All right, Walter.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Fine.
It'll be fine, yeah.
Don't call me doll, Larry.  I hate it when you call me doll.
They ever love you back?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
Hey.  You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You ever been in love?
You do.
Yeah, right.
Not only is it tacky, it's exploitation.
--Sig-Sauer .38.  I love it.
Thanks, Dad.
Can't.  I gotta drive out to Glades, then I'm meeting Ray Nicolet at ten.
He was.  Ray's with the F.B.I. now, he switched over.
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Yes.
Yes!
No! I resigned last week!
Yes!
You've been having quite an exciting time here, haven't you?  All those meetings and business deals and society people - haven't you been having fun?
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
Really?
So what’s the big surprise? You didn’t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
You would?  Really?
Would you be willing to have dinner with me?
It’s like a museum.
For the week?
What if you couldn't find him…?  Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
You said it differently then.
Okay... Who'd you meet?
All right.
It gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. Especially if you're over near the bay.
Thank you.
Would you like some brandy?
No, it's not the cut that's bothering me.
I'll get it, sit down, Miss Daniels. Do you want a sweater or something? A quilt?
If you have some, I'd...
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Why not?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Where are you taking us now?
Have you had any dizzy spells this week?
It's where you belong.
Well?... what'll you do?
Ah, Johnny-O...
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
At least you were never lonely.
You don't miss it?
But you had so much *responsibility*.
Just a little privacy.
I don't think so.
<i></i> If you do, I'll be right there beside you. So face it. You're just going to have to be happy!
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
You don't have to entertain me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Open it.
I'm not very good at it.
Hello?
Write!  Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Miles?
Not anymore.
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
Well it's more than loneliness. Hate. People hating me -- and watching me and following and waiting to hurt me -- you know? I'm all screwed up.
The good outwitting the bad.  It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You're already contaminated.  It's why you couldn't hear the tape.  There's probably a pentacle near your bed.  To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy.  I understand. Check your parents' blood types.  Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Three.
I didn’t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
You can't. You're afraid!
Why do you have to defend her?
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
And what happened to Carl?
Daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud?  Go after crooked bookkeepers.
Not the hacking and gagging and spitting part.  Please.
Can we make this quick?  Roxanne Korrine and Andrew Barrett are having an incredibly horrendous public break- up on the quad.  Again.
You're asking me out.  That's so cute. What's your name again?
All right. Loneliness.  Well -- separated. From other people. Forgotten.  Well, as if I can be here, I can go through the motions, right? But the truth is, I don't belong.
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
My friend is looking for her brother and she thinks this woman knows where he is.  Can you tell us what she's saying?
What's she saying?
I don't know.  I just asked her if she knew him and all of the sudden--
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue.  Which brings us to here.  Correct again?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Hi.
Are you okay?
How?  How can you see anything?
I'm turning you.
I should try and move your bed.  I want you to be able to see the view.  It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
Good morning.
Is this the wish of the masses?
So happy and so tired.
Fine.
Lighten up.
No?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Thank you.
Oh. thank you.
What about those other guys you live with?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
It hurts too much.
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
No I.... Andy, you can't be sure.
Andy?... What? What is it?  Andy... are you okay?
You made me go there. I tried to stop you! You wouldn't listen!
Hello.
Gold dog collars? They don't have dogs.
was so scared—that it scared—
was—but—
I don't want it now.
know—but—
Oh, Peter! I was so scared.
Come on.
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Pub Golf?
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
Why don’t you get my half sister her seventh hole?
I'd love to have a dog. But I go to school full time. It wouldn't be fair to the dog.
Parsons School of Design. I knew growing up I wasn't much to look at, so I put my energy into making things that are pretty.
I want to go home.
No.
No.  I haven't done it in years.
I have.
It didn't get there from me.
No -- never.
Oh, hello.
They said that'd be tomorrow.  They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Thank you.
So, you say you've been to Italy before?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain...  But that's the only place you could be from.
I know.
Closed.
My... husband.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Yes.
Yeah, he's your freak friend Mandella's boyfriend.  I guess since I'm not allowed to go out, I should obsess over a dead guy, too.
What?
Smells like dirt.
When?
Are you talking to me!
Thank you.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father?  That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost.  Satan is the weak one.
Getting your hair done...  Would you like to go to a party?
What's that noise?
-- never mind.
He's a hairdresser.
-- no.
It's safe.
What about the moon?
Bye...
This is day care.  It’s where babies go when their parents are at work.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Try not to be late because kids don’t like to be the last one picked up.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Why?!
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
WHAT??
Good.  Perfect.  I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
And if you don't?
Baby, don't lie. I know you went out.
You're wearing a <u>topcoat</u>, Stu. - Where are your pants?
You have more than one gynecologist?
Why, Jeffrey. Hello.
Yeah?
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
You remember what happened next?
Hell no.
Ha! Ha! Now go back.
Then you should go back to your table.
Why?
At what?
Why?
What things made you so sure?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy.  What things?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Wynant's body?
And you're worried about him.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Why not?
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
What are you staring at?
Sure.
Yes.
Have you made up your mind?
Get outta here.  Could I speak to you privately?
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money.  Don't get upset.
Oh, sure.
Really?
And a fact is a fact.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
You know, at band camp?  We have dances like this.  Only they're way funner.  Don't you think prom is just highly overrated?
No...I know the perfect time...
Kevin...  I want to have sex with you.
Is he your friend?
What's he like?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road.  I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries.  It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes.  The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion.  It's passion.  It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
Not young; he wasn't young -- gray at the temples, he -- well actually he looked like you.
No, open it...
I found it at an outlet store.  I know it’s a knock-off, but I think it’ll look great on you...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about?  You never wait all day.  You can barely wait until it’s light out.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?!  I am not a fool.  I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert.  And now they attack Brown too.
Aren't they great?
A month from today?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
And you...?  Do you love Enzo?
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples.  You'll find a girl there.
Maybe she has.
You do?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
Mother!
And this is what you want—thirty- nine dollars and sixty cents?
I was surprised to get your note. My daughter hadn't told me anything about you. About your helping her.
Come in. Sit down.
don't know. I'd have to see on what you base your claim. I presume you feel you're justified in—
Please understand me. When I say she didn't tell me anything about it, I mean not until a little while ago. She thinks you're entitled to anything you can get.
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
...I'm sorry.
Joel, come here. Please.
What if?
Oh, um...
Make love?
That's okay. I --
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Because I love it so. It's beautiful there. Especially at sunset.  Ah... thank you for the fire.
Till then.
On the train?
It wasn't business.  It was pleasure.
Forget it.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
So what's going on, Joel?
No, never!
At the end of the green there was a whitewashed stone house with a lovely pepper tree at the corner --
Vivian.
Oh, God...
It's been 84 years...
Company would cost you... a hundred dollars.
Oooh, I love those.
I never joke about money.
Is that all?  You just fold back the bedspread?
Thanks!  Consuelo, are all rich people so lazy they can't do this on their own?
M'hm.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Can I ask you something?
What do you want to be when you grow up?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
When?
So you'll call me, right?
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I'm glad you called.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Yeah, mine too.  Is it like, y'know, normal?
Not at all.  It was fascinating.
Well, seeing as you have so much luck with cars, Buddy thought it might be better to bring two.  He got this guy he says you know from Lompoc, Glenn something.
It's getting kind of chilly on deck. If you'll excuse me, I think I'll go to bed. Good night, Mr. McKinney!
Good night, idiot!
That's why Michael and I were the wrong fit.  Right from the start.
Stuckey!  He wants an "appointment" with me after you leave.  You my pimp now or did he think that up on his own?
Watched her come out of the apartment, someone I didn't know... walking in a different way... holding her head in a way I didn't know; and get into her car, and drive out to...  Golden Gate Park. Five miles. She sat on a bench at the edge of the lake and stared across the water to the old pillars that stand an the far shore, the Portals of the Past. Sat there a long time, not moving... and I had to leave, to got to the office. That evening, when I came home, I asked what she'd done all day. She said she'd driven to Golden Gate Park and sat by the lake. That's all.
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
We said "no questions."
A franc for your thoughts.
I don't know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I want to be with him always...
I want my fucking money.  I'm getting out of here.  I don't want anything more to do with you.
Fine. Is it going ok?
Your goddamned friend, he thinks the only reason I'm with you is for the money.
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh . . .
Uh-huh.
What was our deal when we first got together?  Brutal truth, remember?
Jerry.  You and I are salespeople. We sell --
I have to finish my job --
Well, it's true.  Just pay me what you owe me and I'm gone.
It's not "love me."  It's not "trust my handshake."  It's make the sale. Get it signed.  There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me.  Ever since Joe showed.  It's like he dropped from the clouds...
...We're never all together two nights in a row.  Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it.  What's going on?
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
It's so pitch-black tonight.  I feel lost.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Nobody?  Morningside three-one-two-four.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you!  Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side?  Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you?  Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you.  I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty.  What sacrifice do you want from me?  I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Yes.
Good.
But clear... so very clear... for the first time... all of it...
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Do you understand that?
Good.
Yes, madame?
Do you want to talk to  Zoe?
Is your back still killing you?
How much is your salary?
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Arlyn had a very big habit - heroin - she's the one who started Frank. She's strung out now; you won't find her.
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
What's the matter?
Oh, Stu. Tell me I'm not dreaming.
Is it a poem?
Jacques?  I'm pregnant.
Daddy.  Does your friend have a name?
I love you.
As below, so above.  You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
In a village called Domremy.
Really, Susan, I don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.
Why on earth do you say that?
Why?
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
Excuse me.
I... submit to Our Lord.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Let me do that.
She was only teasin'.
Is this fun?
Driving, talking to me...
You have a great profile.
Seriously?!?
You are a virgin!
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Yeah.
I haven't.  No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
Go away. Who are you --?
Alone. All alone.  Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Strange man...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Seeya tomorrow.
That's murder!
What?
What is it you're after, Miles?
See the tape. Then we can discuss reconciliation. Rex screwed up and I nailed his ass. Now I'm going to have it mounted and have my girlfriends over to throw darts at it. Then I'm getting on with my life. That's all I'm after.
No, I don't think so. I --
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
I know, right?
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Well... OK...
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I know that...
Oh, look what happened. Oh god, I'm so sorry. Are you OK?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life.  I don't even care.  I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me.  But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me?  Be a little decent.
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction.  Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing.  Cancer.  I'm dying.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Check.
Could be...
That is my telescope.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
If only it were that simple.
Yes, exactly!
Worse I'm afraid.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
No.
Will you join me for dinner?
Stop accusing me!
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
I'm saying it now!
Well, are you? Are you queer?
What was that?
I'm afraid some harm may come to her.
Scottie, do you believe that someone out of the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?
Someone dead.
I'm sorry.  I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
Now... here we have two very handsome soft-boiled eggs. Do you suppose hens mind what happens to their eggs? Probably not. They have such unfeeling eyes. We'll put in a great nugget of butter, plenty of pepper and salt... Darling, I haven't seen you for three livelong days... seventy-two hours!
Blue? Let's offset his mood. Find a striped one, and brighten it with a great blaze of tie.
Not in your condition.  Make it tepid, Gaston... tepid and tender. And lay out his gray suit.  Afterwards I'll drive you through the Bois. Slowly... in Waltz time.
Nonsense. How can you fight the Reds and make yourself agreeable to the Whites if you don't keep up your strength.
Oh, I don't know...
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
Good night.
Hello, Jeff.  Yes, I'm all right.
I don't want to talk to him.
For me?
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Lotte called me.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I had a good neighbor, George.  She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free.  Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Return 'em.  Maybe you'll get your money back.
Cause I don't even know you.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Because you act like a pig.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
Absolutely.
What do I have to do?
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies?  My mom won't ever buy them.
What's wrong?
The shrink? Many times.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room—under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him.  Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Oh!
I got married.  He was on staff at the clinic.  I was down in Salinas.  It didn't... last long.
I had him in two classes.
She's really sick you know.  Don't you know what she's doing?  She knows I went to Berkeley.  She knows I knew Noah.  She makes up that story about me.  She's handing you somebody who's obsessed with he her.
She knew you'd find out who Lisa Henderson is.  You're a good cop -- what did she do?  Tell you casually and make it seem irrelevant?  Did she tell you in bed, Nick? That's how I'd do it.
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Yes.
I'll think about it.
I have to go back now.
Boy, those were the days.
I switched that around when you weren't looking.
You need a baby-sitter.  That's what I'm here for.
Amen.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
That’s all I wanted to hear...
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
I will I promise.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
You? ---------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                           58.
He won another blue ribbon and bit the judge. Ha! ha! ha! I bought him the cutest sweater as a reward. You should see him strut down the street in it. He looks like a little boulevardier.  You see, Count d'Algout gave me Punchy for my birthday.  You must have searched weeks before you found anything as divine as Punchy, didn't you, Leon?
General, would you mind making my excuses at our table? I'll be back in a few moments.
I've some wonderful news for you, Leon. It's about Punchy... do you mind if I sit down?
Poor Madame Yakushova... here we are talking in mysteries.... I'm sure you wonder what it's all about.
Do you get paid a lot?
That's a long time.
But what if something happens to you?
But how can you be sure?
I fear I'll never see you again.
I wrote the letter.
Yes, I was lying.
No.
No.
No.  At least, I didn't until I came up here.
At my flat. I'm off at midnight and...
Yes, sir.
Did you?
You're serious.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
George...
Wow.
Of course, it's normal for a man to tie his trunk up with a heavy rope.
That's not possible.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
Why not?
We'll transplant it. To the forest.
Jesus.
Oh my God.  And they got a photo of you dressed like that?
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take...  ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
The driver will...
Say it.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Jack... Green Jack, you mustn't flatter me so.
...Fine.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
When did you decide all this?
How?  How were we the same people?
What?
I don't know.
I might.
No. I was just... No.
Day work.
What's that?
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Oh, no, really, I --
Yeah, but at least I knew Rome was gonna be there when I arrived...
You made out alright.
You take care of yourself then, Betty, and don't let anybody stop you...
Ellen, this is the biggest thing I've ever done, but I've gotta do it.
You think that's too much?
That sounds sensible.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
As a three-dollar bill.
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
If I could have a little more room.
Lloyd, give it up.
Someone's got that job.  Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
This is a photo of hair.
Well, it's the same woman.  And he was crazy about her.  What is this?  This is from Seattle.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
It's a sign --
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times.  I'm so stupid.  From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter.  It was great.  We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
Yeah.
What?
A seven.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Save it for your wife.
I wear a seven.
Where did you find it?
We flopped the first time out.
I know that niche.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Oh, yeah?
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
I bumped into your...
What a night.
About two-thirty.
What rehearsal dinner?
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Were you ever going to say anything?
I've got a present. Shut your eyes. Keep 'em closed. I know you're going to love them.
Do you like them?
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom.  They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
Scottie --
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh, great.
Thank you.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Sounds like something Tom would say.
You don't seem to upset?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Frank's a good man.
Technically.  They're separated.
No. We're not stayin' --
Huh... that's strange.
You disappeared.
The trek out to the hospital every day didn’t help either...  You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
Are you...okay?
That's good. Terrific.
I don't care about the damned car. My luggage's been stolen.
You'll tell, or you'll be back in that corset! Come on!
I beg your pardon?
Are you... an architect?
What are you doing with all these blueprints?
What's that?
You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to?  But maybe I was wrong.  Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
What?!
And far too aggressive.
It is unfortunate that you have so few more days in Paris.  Be sure and redouble your efforts so that madame can take some pleasant memories when she returns to Moscow.  Good night.  Good night, Leon.
It's a week.  We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Where've you been?
I could help you.  I could get you off that.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There isn't any.
How's it going chef?
When??
You're not easy to figure.  I'm just very good at figuring.
Won't take any time.
Not me.
Why not?
I'll take that.
How much are your rooms?
You have one with two beds?
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
A boy?
They'll eat it anyway, you ever been to a walk?
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret.  Now that's all I have.
It's okay.
Doing what?
You still in school?
That's my father. I got to run.
Yes?
Where's Gilbert?
Really?  You seriously want to go with me?
Michelle.
I thought so.  Because, one time?  I was at this --
Is it because we have a test tomorrow? Sometimes I get cranky when I know I have a big test to study for.
Are we going to Steve Stifler's party afterwards?  That would be so cool.
Mickey?
Catch me letting you go alone!
Talk to me.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
You think he misses me at all?
And what do you do for mankind?
Then I'm glad I lost the bag! I'll write you the check immediately.
No. What is it? Tell me.
Well--
No, thank you.  Won't you call me Melanie?
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
Well, nobody can say we didn't try.
Why?
I hope those guys are all right.
I want your feelings about it.
Is she all right?
So where is your roommate, the model?
It's gonna be fine.  These people are ready for anything.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people.  Can I make it?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
I'm sorry... Oh my gosh, are you George McCord?!
He's handled a lotta pitchers whose records were better than one and six.
Then why stay in the hills.
I like it.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yes.  In the church at Domremy.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
Walter!
Why would she come here...
In that order?
What's the title?
Snap out of it!
I'm feeling okay--
Sergeant?
Yes, Sergeant.
You're testing me?
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Maybe that's my problem.
I know it is.  Right after my parents died, I went to the beach...  I was in the water.  Everything was calm.  And then one of those really big waves hit me.  Hard.  Pulled me straight to the bottom.  I struggled and finally ran out of air.  If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
I was desperate.  I knew you wrote about murders.  I needed a way in.
Nilsen.
No, Nick, please --
Calm down, Benjamin.
What?
Thank you.
Which way do you want to go?
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
The biggest waste of time since television.
To shave your chest?
Would you stop being ridiculous?  Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Adam, that's not true!
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
You don't understand you either.
No!
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
Wait, I was going to tell you--
That's perfect!
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
He's not gonna want us.
You looking' for some company?
Hey Sugar, you lookin' for a date?
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Oh no, dearest Jack... I meant every word.
Very--your mother?
They'll go on early.  Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
But when did he go? How do you know?
Me neither. I heard he was eighty years old. I'll be eighty next week. A good time to move on, don't you think?
You're welcome.  Did you know him?
I mean, seventy-five is too early, but at eighty-five, well, you're just marking time and you may as well look over the horizon.
--and you swear when you get to the other side, you'll never come near either of us again?
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Why?
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
Just let me sit down.
Like you could find one
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
They don't know?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
Hello.
Tell him I won't be able to see him for a half an hour.
How do you do, my friend.
What is it, Rakonin? Did you lose your job?
My jewels?!
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
Good.  Can you bring me to him?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Oh God! What does that mean?
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
And  I love you, Pete!
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
You scared me.
I'm fine.
Sit... and spin.
Guess he talked to you.
The price just went up to ten.
Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls?
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
I can't do that.
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
And why would that scare me?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't know what you want --
Yes. How did...
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
What is Debbie's position?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwetükame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Would you get me another, Joely?
He never even asked. He just assumed --
Do you think he set me up? Do you think that was his intention?
He told me to -- he said he wanted me to --
Forgery and Fraud?
So. Now what?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Oh, yes! Every day. But I don't need a defense anymore. I embrace! Still fighting for the Big Issues but now in my small, individual way. Shall we have a song?
No.
Oh, Big Issues. Liberty. Rights. Justice. Kings died and kingdoms fell. I don't regret the kingdoms - what sense in borders and nations and patriotism - but I do miss the kings. When I was a little girl I was taken to the palace in Vienna, to a garden party. I can still see the sunshine, the parasols, and the flashing uniforms of the young officers. I thought then I would marry a soldier.  Later, Frederick would chide me about it.  He was so serious. A doctor at the University. And in the government.
My umbrella?  Oh, that's just a relic. I found it when I was packing to come to America. It used to be my defense on picket lines and rallies and political meetings - being dragged off by police or attacked by thugs of the opposition.  A long time ago.
Chardin. Dame Marjorie. But you may call me Maude.
Thanks, no. I despise any form of exercise.  Don't forget we have an engagement for cocktails and cards.
Keymaster?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies.  Did you know him very well?
Will you unzip my dress?
Benjamin?
Won't you unzip my dress?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable.
Jacques...?
Daniel Burdon, please.  Karen Sisco.
If you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.
You can live or die, it's up to you.
You don't, huh?
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
Still.  All's fair in love and w...
I mean Walter owns the Sox, cable sports... most girls in her spot would be angling to get Daddy to offer you some juicy gig right here in t...
Oh, Mother shut up!  Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
Expressing my opinion is not a terrorist action.
I still maintain that he kicked himself in the balls.  I was merely a spectator.
Oswald was an assassin.  You're not an assassin, are you, Jerry?
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Marriage is happy news.
Okay.
I know.
When I passed through the laundry yard today I saw all the women huddled around this so I brought it up here. Things like this create a bad feeling. First they didn't know whose it was. Then they saw the Paris label and did it start a commotion! Some said it's what we all ought to wear and others said it's like hanging foreign ideas on our clothesline. It undermines our whole cause.
I see.
I have nothing to hide.
You should. I'll show you.
Ninotchka, you know I am your friend, you can trust me.... Did you bring back anything else?
No, I left everything in Paris. I just happened to be wearing this.
You know how it is today... all you have to do is wear a pair of silk stockings and they suspect you of counter-revolution.
Thank you, Anna. I'll dry it up here when I wash it next. I should hate to see our country endangered by my underwear.
Tell me... what else did you have?
Well, a hat...
Burn it to a fine ash.
It's terrific Win.
They've got two monsters now.  Both boys.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You didn't like him?
I don't know you.
Let me guess, you're a... lawyer.
Aw, come on, Bill.  It's just business.
I think it's great.
Where'd you go?
Big feet -- large shoes.
The thing that's so irritating is that now I'm so totally fierce when it comes to nudity clauses.
Yeah.  Too good.  I forgot where I was.
Fie!  Don't speak of charms.  I should charm you for being so dull- witted.
Only that?
Then, tis not for chastity? Methought you kept a naked blade twixt you and any maiden chanced spend the night.
I called and called but you were out.  I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
Here we go again.
I don't feel anything.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
I don't.
Jesus, you act like you're seducing some Valley girl you picked up in a dance club.
Oooh, Baby, you were the best. I was beside myself.
You think I fit here where they just about chew your food for you?
Can't you answer?  What's the matter with you anyhow?
Really, Frank?  When was that?
I was talking to Jim.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook?  Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll."  Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Was this during Betty?
No one put me up to anything.  I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
It was great.
No, but
He's not a "hot rod".  Whatever that is.
Fine.  I see that I'm a prisoner in my own house.  I'm not a daughter. I'm a possession!
Listen, I know you hate having to sit home because I'm not Susie High School.
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I never knew that.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
You're gonna be on "T.J. Hooker"?
No. I mean. I don't know.  What else do you know about him?
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself.  Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
He won't take us.  Don't you want us around?
It's for my complexion.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
It was an unusual experience.
Grouchy?
Is that what you would've done?
No.
No thanks.
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
It's beautiful.  What's it about?
Arabic?
This is - what is this?
Ask her if she knows where he is?
Peaches and cream.
Do you realize I have light eyes?
Why not?
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
Everything on it.
But--
It's a fake.
What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
He needs someone incredible, someone really close, who he can trust...
And to m...
It would only be, maybe, six months? Or three or four? It would mean so much to him...
What were the others?
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Well, not monumentally.
Yes...
Unbelievably handsome.  You look fantastic in a suit.
I'm sorry.  I'm not sure how this works.  I have to go out... is that all right?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Uh ...
Huh?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
I love you, my little Leonitchka!
Not really. Maybe a little.
The thin... the girl with small eyes. The one in your cupboard.
What happened between you and the blonde?
I'm fine.
Did she leave you? Come on. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Who did she leave you for? Your best friend? Her boss? A woman? Did she leave you for a woman, John?
We didn't hit it off.
He thought so, yes.
I'm not very good at this, Mitch.
Shhhh. Shhhh.
Please.
Please don't mess me up with bandages, Mrs. Brenner.
Nevermind.
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
When?
So?
He's got a standing invitation.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Oh shit...
You're scarin' me, baby.
You knew my daddy?
But, Leon, I am only here for a few days.
Well, when it is a choice between my personal interest and the good of my country, how can I waver? No one shall say Ninotchka was a bad Russian.
So -- you're behind all this. I should have known.
The one I got they wouldn't let me read.  It began, "Ninotchka, my darling," and ended, "Yours, Leon."
A porco?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Why would you be floating?
I'm sorry.  What was the question again?
You already asked me that.  Why do you insist on making me repeat myself?
You've asked me that one three times.
Are you dead?
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah.
Despite my love of weird metaphysics and my rejection of most Judao-Christian ethics, I am, within the framework of a baseball season, monogamous.
I'm not a real batter.  I'm a woman.
But thanks.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
I think so.
Well, what d'you think?
I have a date, Daddy.  And he ' s not a captain of oppression like some men we know.
Let's go.
What was?
It <u>is</u> beautiful. But I got a little tired of sleeping in antiques, so I gave it to my secretary.
Yeah, don't talk in someone's backswing.
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Did you hear me?
Is the trial date set?
The monkey.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
Yes is a comfort.  Absolutely is not.
Fiction.  We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on.  More.
This is not very good, is it?
Shall we be all right?
And I... love you...
Sunlight... It destroys him.
No... it's not you he's afraid of, it's... light...
In the dark... where I join him...
That's why he goes masked during the day...
I'd love to.
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
So Dad rang the bell and when Tony Pee-Pants opened the door, I threw the tart at him and popped his stitches.
Would you watch the damn road?
--when you go away.
He won't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
No.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
No sand.  That's your drugs speaking.
Coffee and a donut.
What did they say?
Sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing -- but doing it the way you are --  -- with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see -- is, is diseased!
Jeff -- if you could only see yourself.
What is it you're looking for?
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Same difference.  If you love someone, it's your duty to save them from themselves.
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help.  Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Tell them Pete.  Tell them...
...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy.
Fine, I just --
I was at a cocktail party.  Very trendy.  Andrew was in Chicago on business.  He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling.  He looked so helpless.
That’s right.  Okay, let’s make a quick stop at the kids’ shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I’ll run into the linen store...
Look. I almost killed my -- I almost killed someone.
No.
Look -- could I use your phone?
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Yes, he's just adorable.
Before or After I have my nervous breakfown?
That feels so great.
I don't know... I just feel scared.
The wedding, my parents, your family, our friends, my job, the future, our relationship, the caterers, my gown, your tuxedo, our honeymoon, the apartment, my shower, your bachelor party...
Thank you, Leon... thank you, masses.  Can I make a speech now?
Comrades! People of the world! The revolution is on the march... I know... wars will wash over us... bombs will fall... all civilization will crumble... but not yet, please... wait, wait... what's the hurry?  Let us be happy... give us our moment....  We are happy, aren't we, Leon?
What else can you do?
You know carpentry?
We had some lemonade and he left.
Yeah.
Father, I have sinned...
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
You know who The Raincoats are?
What, again?
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again.  Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Turn on your radio!
Hello.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Just be yourself.
Yes!
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!...  Listen, you still have to eat.
Okay. Let's catch up. You go first.
Yep.
I'm sure you've done worthwhile things in the last ten years. You've had experiences.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
I'd like to see you work.
You're such a baby.
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Okay.
...everything I know.
Oh great!
Yeah, you would.
Well, where is it?
Yeah, unhappy and fat.  And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Oh, God.
Don't let me get started on my childhood.  Oh, you know what?  There is a bookstore.
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The captain...
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I don't believe it.
Oh Clark, no!
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
Kit...
Forget it.
Thanks.  We will.  Goodbye.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
Who is she?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Yeah, no, I see --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
Right.
What did you do to him?
Last time I saw him he was this strong guy.  Now he's beaten. And you <u>liked him</u>.
I know.  I watched it.  I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please.  My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is.  A nice long break.
You take what people say and make it ugly.  You make others believe what you want them to.  She should have been found guilty.  She shouldn't have gotten off.
No.
About me?
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
I know who you are and what you want.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first.  You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
What are your intentions?  To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool.  I don't get it.  You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset.  Who are you anyway?  And what are you eating?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I was hoping to meet him.
Goodnight!
Scare me, why don't you?!!?  You stupid son of a bitch!!!
Well, you should be!  Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
Bogey Lowenstein's party is normal, but you're too busy listening to Bitches Who Need Prozac to know that.
What's normal?
You're ruining my life'  Because you won't be normal, I can't be normal.
Daddy, people expect me to be there!
It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria Steinem" over there isn't going --
Sometimes.
I've got a degree in psych.  It goes with the turf.  Games are fun.
Cocaine.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Definitely.
Oh, good.
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
Well stop worryin' about me and start worryin' about how you're gonna get that Lula back here and away from that murderer.
Listen, I'm coming over. Don't go anywhere. Stay right there.
I'll hire a hit man if you don't want to help me stop this thing. I'll call Marcello Santos.
Don't talk down to me, Johnnie Farragut. I know what volition means, and that's why I want Sailor Ripley off the planet! He's pure slime and it's leakin' all over my baby. Maybe you could push him into makin' some kinda move and then kill him dead. You'd only be defendin' yourself, and with his record, nobody'd fuss.
Are you okay?
Oh, Johnnie Farragut... Don't you trust your very own Marietta?
You're just jealous of Santos cause he's sweet on me.
Yes.  I feel that, too.  Weakness is what is ugly.
Why did she do it?
But we fought.
I love you, too.
Was she right?
I don't think do.  It's not sleep; it's something else.  It's all around me.
And I with you... I never dreamed life held such pleasures...
O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
And you weren't. As usual. What do you say to that?
I told you! My name is Judy Barton! I come from Salina Kansas. I work at Magnin's! I live here! My gosh, do I have to prove it?
Listen, what is this? What do you want?
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Which way?
Pancakes.
Salina, Kansas!
Why not?
Oh, Frederick!
What if they expel you?
I told you! Right here!
I wish you didn't have to go so early.
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Was it a nice funeral?
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Just that they came out of somebody's experience is all.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
It's been going on for a while.  Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
And when you do I'll convey your respects by wireless to Herbert.  Take it easy, Lee--no other woman'll ever get you. At least I'm honest when I tell you there must be something pretty low down in me--because I like you.  You're such a swine!
Don't be crazy, mama. Take care of yourself.
It's me who's wastin' time, Sailor, bein' with you.
I ain't that dumb, mama. Sailor and I been on a crime spree? Knockin' off convenience stores all across the south? Ain't you read about it?
Lula? I love you, baby. I just want you to be all right.
I am all right, mama. That's why I called, to let you know. I gotta go.
I can't believe you did that!
You're the reason I never met him. You knew it was the thing I most wanted in life and you sabotaged it.
Leave me be for a minute? Mama gets all insane and then I see you practicin' your individuality and personal freedom with some oil-town tramp. How you figure I'm gonna feel?
Did you muss up her hair by accident, too?
Hang on.
No way.
Aren't you?
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Yes --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BENJAMIN?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Why is it?
Oh!
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
They're great.
No.
And the answer was so simple.
Well, perfection can get wearing after whi...
I'm not joking.  I had to face up to all my competitive drives, and believe me, I've got 'em.
I was gonna predict that.
You win.
No, a cab will be faster.
No, not really.
Yes, I should think so.
Yes, Doctor.
He's fine. We'll come right over.
You forgot your keys!
What are you sure about?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
Time for what?
Hey!
Two.
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Where are you going?
Thanks. Nurses, governesses, chaperones, even body-guards. Oh, it's been a lot of fun.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Yes, you do. You think I'm a fool and a spoiled brat. Perhaps I am, although I don't see how I can be. People who are spoiled are accustomed to having their own way. I never have. On the contrary, I've always been told what to do and how to do it and where and with whom. Would you believe it? This is the first time I've ever been alone with a man!
That's impossible.  I'm not Rheya.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You'll call me, right?
When?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession?
Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize?
Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail?
I think I'll just lie down awhile
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
That-that won’t do. That’s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that’s the way...
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
Oh, hello, Dad.
Not that. Look at what I wrote down cause I can't say it.
No, I don't think so, Sail. I just need to lie down.
Sailor? You know what?
He needed you, maybe.  So do I.
Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
Therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet Howard -- I wish to execute a pre- nuptial agreement.
That is true, isn't it Miles? Your pre-nup is the best there is?
But they can't do that. You haven't even got the vote.
Well, don't go.
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, sorry.
I'll get your back.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
How is she?
Apipoussan!
Good! Do you know how we say "make love"?
Yeah.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Come on in!
Only a pig would say that!
I'm so sorry!
That... that... who was that?
Yes--are you?
But--
What's wrong.
I always wondered about that too.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Listen to this, I love this part --
Men never get this movie.
Harold and Maude is my all-time favorite movie.
Have you seen it?
A fucking moron.
Why bounce when you have your own condo in Nepal to go to?
You're a movie buff?
We need blood.  To nourish the stone.  charge the stone with ener- gy.
That's the life spark.  Exxence of magic and sorcery!
Again:  what is the magician's weapon?
He's not proposing marriage, there's no way I'm buying one word of th...
He takes a razor from his dinky little dopp kit, cuts his fingertip, takes my hand, does the same to me...
He says, "Swear.  When we're both 28, if we've never been married... we marry each other!"
You think...
Cancoon.
What?
How come?
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
Then how do you expect to write about it?
Stewart, have you ever been to Old Madrid?
Well, you're not getting your play done, but you're certainly covering a lot of territory.
OK, see you downstairs.
Hi.
I'm just happy to see you.
Are you from up there? Space?
My father's house.
It crashed, didn't it?
I predicted it.
Well, I only quote from the best.
Okay, I give up.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
No. You’re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!
Monica, what did you do?
Dorothy Parker--
Don't let's take any chances.
Like some vile toadstool.
Protection?
Then why hide behind a mask?  You are ashamed!
And you... are you not also afraid?
You... you're a beast!
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone.  I was so torn when you called.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something.  Or go to a whorehouse!  No?
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
Mama, Sailor's in deep trouble here. I just can't leave him.
You're comin' home, precious. Santos' gonna drive us to the San Antonio airport.
I'm goin', mama. No way I can't go.
Thank you.
Yes.
I need very little sleep. We must be extremely careful what goods we take in exchange. I have already started a survey of our most urgent needs.
May I ask why?
I'm sorry about your arm.  Kabuo and I.  Are very sor...
No.  I don't even know why I do it.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street!  I wasn't even near there!
No.
I didn't know he had a wine cellar.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
What the hell's going on?
Your mother's not dead.
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie.  I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What are you doing here?
Oh, Peter! What happened? Are you all right?
Why not? I'm hungry.
Never!  I'm going in and ask him—
You drink bug repellent?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
No thank you.  I need to get my car back.
A coke.
Around.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
No, thank you.  Thank you so much.
Uh, yes.
Something of great value, something of such artistic and historic significance that only you could truly appreciate...
Answer the question, Patrick
You tell me.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
That was foolish of me. Why didn't you shove me away?
My man?  You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men.  Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man?  You're Just a dirty little fixer.
What did you say?
Oh yeah?  What did I get?  What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week?  You think your company is such a treat?  Your moods, your...  "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Because.
Besides.  I've been starting point the last two years.  Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Only, it's in Italian...
No...  it's just very important that I find him, okay?
It has its moments. It got to be a sort of game to try to outwit father's detectives. I—I did it once; actually went shopping without a body-guard. It was swell. I felt absolutely immoral. But it didn't last long. They caught up with me in a department store. I was so mad I ran out the back way and jumped into the first car I saw. Guess who was in it?
Nothing.  I go to bird shops on Fridays.
On Mondays and Wednesdays, I work for the Travelers' Aid. At the airport.
I do different things on different days.
On Thursdays I have my meeting and lunch.  I'm chairman of a group that's sending a little Korean boy through school. We plan how to raise funds and... things like that.
Yes.
And on Tuesdays, I take a course in General Semantics at Berkeley.  That's not a job, of course. I just take it because...
I'm lucky I found it.  Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
I went with you.  Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone.  Right?  A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what?  Ronny? Are you listening to me?
But why would they murder...
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Sure.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm?
I didn't know I had to.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
But you could go to jail for it.
You know, Dave -- it is Dave, isn't it?  I can't keep all of this a secret.
You find people jobs?
It's just more than anybody else does around here.
This isn't friendship.
I think you're the Devil.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Sit down, stop.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Oh.  Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
What are they?
Is that what you used to do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Who?
What are you doing?
And do you like it that way?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
I think you know that.
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Yeah?
I don't get it.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Now where's she goin'? --
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works.  Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe in Sonora.
Do you love me?
I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
What?
Who said I was going?
...and a fortune teller.
What about Peter?...
Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be.  I've got forty-eight hours.  I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
Terry— what's happening to you?
You?
Who says?
Terry, what's wrong?
Sure.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No.  We keep it in the backyard.  Of course, in the house.  It's in there.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
I did, didn't I?  Look! A shooting star.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
My daughter, Rachel.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
No? Then what?
Oh, I understand, all right. I've been understanding since I was seventeen. And the next step is, as long as you're going to see me tomorrow, why don't you stay the night.
As friends? We'd just see a lot of each other as friends, and you'd "take care of me"?
I was giving you a chance. No matter where you take me ... there's no greater hunter than Prince Humperdinck. He could track a falcon on a cloudy day. He can find you
Smitty.
Let me go home.
Well, after all, it's "our place."
C’mon, you know what I like to hear...
Dad --
<u>What are you, out of your mind</u>!
It's called the Law of Love, asshole.
You're the animals - all of you!
No, count it, anyway.
I’m compulsive and weird?
Six thousand, right?
That won’t be an issue, believe me. I find the idea of sex for money morally repugnant.  No offense.
Don't go.  I'm frightened.  I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
I'll get it.
What's your business?
I'm out! I'm out!
What is it?  Why, it's a toothbrush! Thanks.  You—you had it pressed.
Why, you bully. I believe you would.
That's it?
That isn't true.
She's not here.
No--thirty-five!
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
I saw a picture of you.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Business is good, you're busy?
He's married...
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Don't you even know your letters?
If that little weasel ever walked in here I wouldn't serve him.
I love him.
C'mon!  The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
I'd slap his face.
Did you sleep with her?
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
No!  Not the police!  Don't call them!
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
It makes it faster. If I don't speak to the men, they fall faster. It's pretty obvious why.
You don't understand anything.
It's makes it easier. Okay.
Oh... this and that.
I need to speak with an Agent Lowry.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Good.
So you'll stay?
That way.  You?
That never changes.  You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
How do you think I'm doing?
Harold, that picture is almost twenty-five years old.
I was remembering how much this meant to me. It was after the war... I had nothing... except my life. How different I was then - and yet how the same.
Oh, Harold. You are so young.
Wait a minute!  Let go there!
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Do you believe in all of that?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe.  You took them.  What did you do with them?
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia.  You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded.  You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it.  But this is fifty thousand dollars!
Oh, thank heaven.
That's my business.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Go ahead!
No. He don't.
Do you have a phone?
...No thanks.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Yes, I do.
No.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
A dozen times.
You've done well, Scottie. You're good at your job.
Yes.
I'm a writer,  I use people for what I write.  You write what you know.  Let the world beware.
In the beginning.  Then I got to like what he did for me.
Great-grandmother. The child who was taken from her whose loss drove Carlotta mad and to her death - was Madeleine's grandmother.
What's the matter?  What's the matter with you?  You look pale.  You okay?
Woogie and I went out for awhile in high school.
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
Honest?
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
You're being narrow-minded.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
Highliner, please.
Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
Yeah, I know.
Well...
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You fucker, don't you ever touch Lula - You fucker, I'll kill you.
Santos... I can't...
No... But...
Santos... No... Please, Santos...
But a priest...?
She didn't look Italian to me.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I don't like her.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Not if I can help it.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Jack!
Faith.  Larry has something he wants to tell you about Damon Bradley.
Awwww...
So what's new?
Hey, hi!
Oh, what do they know?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
Lloyd, listen to me.  EVERYTHING has changed.  You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two.  You might be sixty.  You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
A foreign land full of millions of Italian men...  speaking Italian with Italian accents and those huge brown eyes and that silky olive skin...
You're just going to fly to Italy and start combing the streets?
Thank you so much.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Done what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We do?
For how long?  We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
It doesn't make sense to me. What's so different about it here from over there, or any place you go, that one person couldn't live in both places just as easily?
Almost as if it were being written especially for us.
I think it's enchanting.
If you're saying all this just because you don't want to tell me the truth, because you're hiding something from me, then maybe I can understand --
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Thanks.
Come on.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
What?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
Well, yeah, yeah.  You'd love it. It's really entertaining.  You'd have a good time.  I know you would.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What else?
No.
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
I'm an actress.
Oh, look! The birds.
It's all memorabilia, but incidental and not integral, if you know what I mean.
Well, if some people are upset because they feel they have a hold on some things, then I'm merely acting as a gentle reminder - I'm sort of breaking it easy -- Here today, gone tomorrow, so don't get attached to <u>things</u>. Now, with that in mind, I'm not against collecting stuff...
What owners, Harold? We don't <u>own</u> anything. It's a transitory world. We come on the earth with nothing, and we go out with nothing, so isn't "ownership" a little absurd?
She's very sweet, but so old- fashioned. Please sit down, Harold. I'll put on the kettle and we'll have a nice hot cup of tea.
How do you do, Mr. Worley?
Of course. Are there others, Mr. Worley?
No.  It makes me nervous to think about it.  Let's do this.
You might wanna think about it
Benjamin?
Hello.
That's the girl I love.
Your dancing's very good.
... I don't get it done often.
See you? He can smell you from there.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Yes, my lord.
... garden sports, all.  Little swing of maybe fifty degrees Fahrenheit, represents a packing challenge, but there's fine food and cocktails at a choice of Embassy Suit...
So your honeymoon is exactly where?
It depends.  If San Antonio sweeps Sacramento, we could start there. Or Phoenix.  Or depending on Indiana- Clevel...
What? Because I'm a little understand...
... most sentimental schmucks I pity want a honeymoon after their wedding.  Just to top it off.
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
We'll see.
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How!
Could it have damaged the ship?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
The alarm clock.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Yes.
Kill him!
Kill him!
What have you been doing?
I know.
Kill me... I want... so nice...
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
No kidding.  Who else would have done it?
I wish I knew.  It's for my boss.  He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places.  The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself.  Would that be okay?
You heard voices, you know you did.
Sure. Let's go home.
No, I want to walk.
For how long?
A week? A year?
A psychiatrist?!
Well, thank you. Thank you very much, but— you've been very kind.
That, I suppose, makes everything—uh—quite all right.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
He's *paralyzed*!
What do you want me to *do*?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
That would be impossible.
Okay. I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Handle what?
Oh, no. You'll muss me.
Are you sure that's what you want?
And the pony?
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
I know, I know.  But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You talk like an actor.
I like it. And think of the toppings -- cheese, mushrooms, mint jelly
Twenty-two.
Okay, sometimes I'm a nineteen.
Nitrate-sicles -- I like that.
I agree there should be more.
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way.  I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated.
Oh, hello Mother!
Not if you're going to lose any sleep about it.
Yes.  You have a brother in service here, do you not?  I forget his name.
You don't wear garters!
I'm just beginning to believe that something could be done with you.
Gee I hope this doesn't make my cold any worse.
Klute, tell me, what's your bag? Are you a talker, or a button man or a doubler, or maybe you like them very young -- children -- or get your chest walked around with high-heeled shoes, or have us watch you tinkle? Or --
Look, I'm sure this'll amuse you too. Ilia trying to get away from all that.
-- you perverted hypocrite square bastards.
-- You want to wear women's clothes, or you get off ripping things --
Steve --
I still think you should go down.
Are you going down there?
I don't know.  First I thought it was Jim but--
Frank?  I'm frightened.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
Nooo.  This way the rotation stays the same.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan.  I hope you weren't...
Huh?
Ad lib?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
I said I was sorry.
Why are you trying to hurt me?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Yes. I really would.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
Absolutely.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you out of your mind?
So it's an honor?
Keep away --
The oscilloscope's already programmed.
Got it.
A third party?
I'm okay with that.
And the church.
So, we'll...
I love you.  Please, I love you.
I love you.  How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
Well, of course, right...
Tch. What are you --
Can't you get them to go any faster?  This dissolves to a deserted ROAD, Peter at the wheel of his car. His high spirits find expression in his efforts to sing.
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not— I'm just— all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I'm sorry.  It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago.  I've been through this.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Hi...
Hi...
Oh, okay.
What?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
It is only too possible.  Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate?  If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself.  If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more.  I could value only someone whom I loved.
This is such a street of whiners.
There, see?  Now the emblem is right in the middle of the knot.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys.  I hate nose rings.  And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
No.
He seems lonely.
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
That's too bad.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Please go. I'll explain to Mother.
Oh, Stew and I went for a long ride.  Dexter, is there any finishing school we can send him to?
Thanks.  Steel pipes and baseball bats.
It's amazing.  You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking.  Try and get this.  When you edited that...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye.  Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal.  You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear?  It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
What else?  You gonna leave some cash by the bed when you pass through town?
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?
Yeah, you've been pretty tough to take.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten?  What's going on?
Then what will you say?
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"?  The nature of it's in there somewhere.
I do.  I do want to.  That's why I'm leaving.  That's what you given me, see? I know what I want now.  I want a guy like you for real.  Not because you buy me things and give me money.  The nicest thing you ever done for me is hold my hand. You gonna give me that?
What choice!!?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you.  Dad wants to talk to you.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Honey, what happened?
How?
What about me?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door.
You see, I wanted to surprise them.
Mmmm.
I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me.
Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door.
The front door.  Isn't there a back road I can take?
Mmmm.
It's a surprise, you see.
Give me that!
Please.
You get the Christ out! You dumb stupid bastard, you don't know anything, you square, you get out! I don't have to show you anything; you get out!
God, Spiderman looks different.
I didn't even know they had stores that just sold comic books.
What's that?
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
Dad.  What are you doing here?
I don't want to know how to say that though.  I want to know useful things. Like where the good stores are.  How much does champagne cost?  Stuff like Chat.  I have never in my life had to point out my head to someone.
C'esc ma tete. This is my head
How is our little Find the Wench A Date plan progressing?
Forget French.
Oh, yes, and the mare with him.
I don't want it on me.
My own father...
It happened so fast.  He was hurt and ran away.
Your call.  You can live a lie. In a fabulous selection of Red Roof Inns.  Or you can make one desperate stab at hap...
Not with what they pay me...
That’s the one...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I’m going to be heading it up.
You didn’t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things.
It's something I've always wanted to do.
I've been making friends with your cat.  Is it okay that I'm here?
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later.  Can you meet me tonight?
Oh my God!
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
Goodnight.
He's got that nervous talking thing.  I told him not to speak.
It's true.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
No, you didn't.
Give me your hand.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
Do you want to learn or not?
Yes. I can do "Swanee River." Would you like to hear me?
"Humoresque"? I'll bet you don't even know how it goes.
Why?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch.  Why am I putting myself through this?  It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
You don't have to say that.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning...  ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well... you're walking me home.  I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Leave your sister out of it.
Oh, come on, Amado--
Oh, do not go
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
You're kidding.
You’re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down...  Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he’d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found...  Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don’t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest...  I didn’t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Think what you like. But don’t presume to understand.
I didn’t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just...  Do you think we spoke about it? I’ve known for five years. He’s known I’ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn’t speak about...
Good.
Oh, I'm having a wonderful time! I've gone back to my first love... painting.
No, stay.  Please stay with me.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
Goodbye.
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...You do?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too— don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
...Certain people are --
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
I can trust my brain.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
Who did he leave with?
He was murdered.
Not this again.
You watch me, don't you?
Fuck you.  I know you're crazy, but fuck you.
Yeah.
Maybe black means you're happy?
Still sweet.
What an incredible chauvinistic observation.
No, I'm not afraid.  Just... Maybe someday.
Maybe someday.
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Really?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
You got a girl?
"I'm getting trashed, man." Isn't that what you're supposed to do at a party?
Not me.
You too.
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Who says I don't love him?...
Don't you see?..  We're not the ones who are meant to be.  You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
Today has ben a good day.  Which under the circumstances is... unexpected.
Both.
I don't have an Amana freezer.
I was dead, too.
Me neither.
Where are you taking me?
You might hold this for me.
How many minutes between the first and second whistle?
Have you never been caught in a similar situation?
In other words you don't know.
Non.  Please.
Amazing.
Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
It's all right.
What about?
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
And the pregnancy thing -- is that to do with the accident?
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Here you are. There's people out there.
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Oh, yes.  Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete.  Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name.
I can't --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal.  Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Am I really her?
Fine.  What the hell is going on?
Yeah. See you later.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
What are they about?
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Piss off!
Your secretary, huh!
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
There's plenty of fruit.
Allow me.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So...  What do you want to do?
Is that alright, Frank?
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Maybe there's fingerprints on it?
A Butterfinger wrapper.
A rich, possibly fat, slob.
Ah ha!...
What'd you find?
Oh.  Right.
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
What?
You know what I mean?  Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Yes?! But --
Uh huh...
But what are you going to do?
Yeah, like maybe never.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago.  He says I should visit him sometimes.
Do you want me to go?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
No, never! I've never been there! Scottie, what is it? I've never been there!
I had to park two blocks away. Is something -
Professional killer. Do you get dental with that?
Okay.
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Yes!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
So, you gotta be a little flexible. Look at your brother and me. Larry's not perfect, neither am I.  But we work it out.  We're not unrealistic in our expectations, and we have each other.  I think you've got the Door Number Three Syndrome.
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
Open it.
So, what's on your mind?
Visualize a spare?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland— the Middle West somewhere— a job on a farm... .
Then go ahead— go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a—  What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't remember.  Maybe.
I don't know...
That's fine.
Yes, I can.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
I'll go.
Where you goin', honey?
How did she die?  I wanna know.
Eight.
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
Oh, nothin'. I never let on to mama about Dell bein' the one. I just flat refused to tell her who the daddy was? I didn't tell Dell, neither. He was back home in Chattanooga by then, anyhow, and I didn't see the point. Somethin' terrible happened to him, though. Six months ago.
Dell disappeared. Dell was learnin' a hard lesson. What I learned from observin' Dell is I think people who are frightened want to disappear. He'd startin' behavin' weird? Like comin' up to people every fifteen minutes and askin' how they were doin'?
No I haven't.
How about something to eat?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Want some coffee or tea?
I can't go right now.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life.  Once in a while he even talks to me.  I want to be around for that.
I'm sorry.
WAIT A SECOND! I AM NOT THE REASON YOU'RE HERE! I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS, LIVING A PERFECTLY BORING LIFE UNTIL YOU CAME ALONG!
Oh, Bianca?  Can you get me my freshman yearbook?
When will he be back?
Where is Rick?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Long.  You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
I don't mind waiting.
This time of year.
Is he married?
No!
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Does it still hurt?
God.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
Why, honey?
Pace, your daddy'd love you even if you didn't have no hair at all.
Wrong, baby. Your daddy never committed no murder. Musta been you didn't hear grandmama proper. He made some mistakes, is all. Your daddy ain't always been so lucky... We're almost at the depot, honey. Sit back a minute.
Thinkin' a second, baby.
A little.  You get out of the car. That's right, Fuctard. I'm talkin' to you!
Screw you, asswipe!
Let me know if you need anything, okay?
Are you and Larry happy?
Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
All the time...
Well, you are.
Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
You're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey--slow down.
No, Marty, please...
Okay, I'll tell her.
How... When did you...
Shut up.
Duh.
He is one of the great poets.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
Running away is no solution.
What'll I tell him if he calls up?
He's writing. Hello?
You're a fool, Babe.
I just couldn't stand seeing him again.
You don't even want to touch me.
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
What d'you mean?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and $3,000 which should take care of everything.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
I want to see Pilgrim.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
It's still early. What's your next class?
Fine!
I like you, Baron.
Thank you, Baron.
Ooooooh.  Hello my would-be ex-son-in-law. I've sent you a check for a hundred thousand. Yes. That's the smartest thing you ever did, Westley, not to contest that annulment. That's satisfactory, isn't it? Yeah. Well, it ought to be. Oh I'm not complaining. It was dirt cheap.  Don't fall out of any windows.
"What's holding up the annulment, you slow poke? The Walls of Jericho are toppling."  Send him a telegram right away. Just say: "Let 'em topple."
Don't want to talk to—don't want to talk to anybody. Don't want to see anybody.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Where'd you get it?
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
If this was a spy novel, your next words would be something like I now know too much to live.  Why are you telling me all this?
Yours?
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
What?
Poor man.  And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
You say that as though it's some awful thing!  I never stopped loving Wally!
Please... that's enough. I *loved* you, too--you know I did.
Please don't...
Please don't make me say it again.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
Ready?
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Thank you.
Well.  See.  That was a... reflex to see if it would...
Right.  And then it didn't want to come off.  Exactly.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
You don't want me here --
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Why call me?
I must be. But I'm not.  Your home. This is your home.
I didn't mean it!  I didn't know what I was signing!  You tricked me...!
Why?
I'm buying bananas tonight.
Don't get ahead of yourself. You'll probably need it before I will.
Back when I was your age I always used to make myself a big banana split after sex. I think you're gonna need one tonight.
I'm kidding. I'd really love to, Ted, but the thing is I already have plans. How about tomorrow night?
So maybe I could find a nice gentleman to take you to the movies.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
You don't understand.  You don't know what's going to happen.
God... Of course.  I'm sorry -- I mean, I'm...  Brian -- I've got to go.  The man's a lunatic, but I know exactly where he's going next.
Good one!  Thanks.
Weird.  Like after all those years you would remem--
I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian.
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
What? What?
No, we don't have to say it.
Uh-huh.  It was wonderful.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
And you can't concentrate with me around?.
You're nothing but a... a...
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
George, now cut this out.
Oh.
It's nine o'clock in the morning. Nothing's open.
Yeah.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
What's your problem?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley.  Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
Yes, it is.
It's so cold.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise?  I wouldn't want to die here.  I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns.  Very English.  And I know exactly where I want to be buried.  In our garden.  Where I grew up. With a view of the sea.  So promise me you'll come back for you.
Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
Yes.
You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
What're you doing here, Roy?
It was Chloe...
Ted, the lever!
This party is for you and Bob.  Get your mind off the reporter.
I haven't seen him in twenty-four hours. It just gives me the creeps a little bit. I'd feel better if I knew where he was.
Lighten up, wahine.
Lighten up, what?
Would it?
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be.  I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect.  I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes.  Did I tell you that?  You live next door to a real live beauty queen.  I still got the tiara.  I kept it cause I thought it meant something.  I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life.  I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I'm not.  Look at me.  I'm not.
He never says his name.
The things that go on.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested —in pigeons.
That was nice of you.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you.  Joey used to race pigeons.
Like what?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
Peggy Sue Kelcher.  Or, Peggy Bodell.  I'm not sure.
Just looking.
How's he doing?
Is he upset?
Arlyn, he just wanted to ask some questions -- something you could help us about.
He looks great, just great!
That's better.  Got the radar ready?
But... how is he going to breathe?
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say,  "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
My God... Cal. Is it a --
Wander separately? Ah, but only one is a wanderer. Two, together, are always going somewhere.
Why? You have a bowling date?
Why're you driving so fast?
Why are you doing this obviously macho feat?
Who'd want to?
A truck? You're doing this for a truck? That's insanity.
It's ... lovely.
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- uhh-huhh...
Well, there was this one time --
C'mon.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
'Cause I thought maybe you and I could go if you weren't already taking someone.
So who you taking to the prom?
The prom -- you going?
That's true.
Wait just a second there. You sent him here. You unearthed this pestilence.
I'm sorry. That was unkind and -- but, we changed our minds.  Did you really mean what you said on the phone. It wasn't because you found out about Rex?
Just anytime I've tried to keep things normal with anyone normal -- it's been a disaster.
'A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' by Mark Twain.
I thought you were asleep.
I've just started it. My friend gave it to me.
What do you dream about?
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Excuse me?
Were you with him this whole time?
I know. It's up to us.
He's harmless.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
Didn't have to try very hard.
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
Let her go, Craig. I mean “him."
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
I detest serpents.
Have you got a minute?
Oh, fie.  What about the unicorn?
A promise is a sacred oath.
Let's rest a minute.  I'm so thirsty.
A gentleman would offer water.
And why not?
Fireworks.  Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
I'd love some.
That's okay. I get messed with all the time and when I saw him doing that to you I just lost it. I hate when people take advantage of tourists. It ruins it for the rest of us.
Excuse me?
What looks good?
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...?  Picasso.
You're going to have a bachelor party?
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Hi.  Donna Irving?
...Yeah.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
I like yella teeth.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
Stop asking everyone.
Fifty-seven.
Why?
I think Ming is older than Tong.  What is this?
I said yes.
It's not Ming. It's Tong.
Is this Ming?
Miles.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Yes, nurse.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Your Majesty.
Well what're you down about? You mean because you didn't get me there?  You can't expect that. I mean Frank, yes, he'd get me there all the time -- but never with a John.
Feeling better?
Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
No what?
Hello, Benjamin.
This is Bandit I. Over.
We're cool. The dumb schmuck took the wrong turn.
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
What do you think?
Nice car.  Yours?
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Ahhh!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Wow, that's soon --
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you.  Well!  Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here.  It's incredible!
What did he say?
Funny.
I'm sorry --
You and 'Honey'?
Why don't you get off his case?
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, &quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper.&quot;
He still having parties?
Mind if I turn on some heat?
Did you ask him to come visit?
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Are you afraid of anything?
I told him you looked like me.
How'd you get him to say yes?
And he's fine, girl.
He's in college?
This brother from my college.
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
I know...
He will.  He has great faith.
Father, I'm right here.
Dad...
Can we change the subject?
He's about to.
No thanks.
Serving process, a Summons and Complaint.  Some con doing mandatory life doesn't like macaroni and cheese. He files suit, says he has no choice in what they serve and it violates his civil rights.
To me he seems rather nervous.
You see--  Oh, not a word to M'sieu Laval!
What are you talking about?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
What?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Nice friend.
What's his name?
That's following a train of thought.
The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't *come* here to watch the movie.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking.  Get me a beer.
Johnny Cammareri.
I'm fine, baby. We're all okay. We were lucky.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
That makes it okay?
Sure.
Sorry.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
I've got to go now.
Yeah.  Yeah, I'm ... fine.
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor—
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
What's going on?
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
No.
Well... I'm going to go now.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters!
Mostly love, and romance.
Get off me!
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
A trademark move, don't touch it.
Oh... different things, prison, movies.
That was such a great evening.
You said it.
What now?
He certainly -- hic -- does!
No. It's strong.  But I like it that way.
Not right now, thanks.
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Nobody thought we'd do this.  Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
No, Del.
You knew Del?!
Your leg will be fine.  A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
How are you?
Because I'm a nurse.
He never told me anything about... that's unbelievable!
Funny, that's just what I was thinking...
Are you remembering more?
Please come to the point. What is it you want?
How stale last night's gaiety looks! It has the taste of a dead cigarette.
Of course not, my dear! I didn't come here with any such suspicion. How ridiculous!  Nor did I come here to pick up his hat.
Don't worry, you were quite rude enough.  Do you mind if I let in a little fresh air and sunshine? I'm sure it will make you feel better and I want you to be at your very best. In full possession of your faculties, at least.
If you were encouraged to come here by our meeting last night I am afraid you misunderstood my attitude.
It is tomorrow morning... tomorrow noon, to be exact. I hope you will forgive me. I know it's extremely cruel to waken anyone at such an hour. Don't you recognize me? I am the Duchess Swana.
What?
I think we can cut your visit short. Leon is not here.
Edward is taking me to some fancy place for dinner.  The Rex.  Ever been there?
Compared to you, my friend, Shapeley's an amateur.  Whatever gave you an idea you can get away with this! You're positively the most conceited—
Because I realized.  When I see him say "I do," that knife will be in my heart.  And it will be there every...
A headline? You're not a newspaper man, are you?
Love that name.
Hey you.
He's asleep.  Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
Is this the Community Hospital?
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
What's the matter?
He's just around the corner.
The games are over.  You were right. It was the fuck of the century, Shooter.
I told you.  She kills him.
I finished my book.
Prepare these as battering-rams!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
I'll get my clothes all wrinkled.
What!
Oh, Peter—
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
How is your cold?
Sounds good.  How do you know where I live?
I’m fine standing, thank you.
You’re a long way from home...
I don’t smoke. If you could get to the point...
May I ask where you’re from, Mr Lamont?
No dinners, Bertie.  Why are you dressed for outdoors?
How is her family going to feel about it?
Sure - I think so, Stew.
Don't pay attention to him, Stew. He doesn't know what he's talking about.
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
Yes.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
How nice -- your daughters?
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG&E offer it?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I know.  I'm sorry.  Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school.  Can I call you in a little while?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Shit.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Miles. Miles. Miles.
Then, I'll see you around.
The Carlsons' are here.
Why, do you think?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
God, there's Lester...
I'M THROUGH TALKING NOW! GOODBYE!
I'm in a motel. Has something happened to Del? Did he do something stupid?
IF THIS IS ABOUT DEL, FORGET IT! I'M NOT COMING BACK!
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
There is no us.
That's not the point.  And what if I had wanted to?
I will never doubt again.
In ages, I know, me neither.
This is where we are.
Dance with me?
Bob is making her visualize the ceremony.
See, you're not that out of touch.  You're good.
That would be the Baron's way. There'll be no light or life in the world until the alicorn is taken from him and he vanquished.
Big Ed’s.
That’s where you work.
No.  No -- Actually, let's make Ike the pastor.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note...  I was on my way down the stairs...
Amateurs!
He's coming?
Yes.
That's two weeks from Thursday...
I'm sorry, gentlemen. The other day I heard such a funny story...  It still makes me laugh. It is very funny.  I am sorry. Oh yes... about this injunction...
I know, gentlemen, but it is in the hands of the Court. We're helpless, aren't we?
What a gyp.
I think it was sweet of him to pick it out.
I know...  It was.
Look how big it makes me look.  I look like an Alp.
Sort of.
Ah, you'll get her back soon enough. That's easy, she likes you.  What you need to do is learn to press a girl's buttons.  You gotta give her what she's never had.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Watch out, you guys.  Beep-beep!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Tch.  He's such an angry...he's such a depressive.  I thought she was moving out!
Frederick didn't come with her.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, Hannah!
-- ass and legs --
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Could I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
How did it go at the bank?
Want to finish my hamburger?  I only took a bite.
Feel okay?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
What are you staring at?
Go tuck yourself, Bill.
What d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
Not here, Duff.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
What about the wedding?
On your ear, you've got something.
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
Thanks.
What time is it?
Hungry?
Yes, here we are again.  Good night.
What's that?
The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
I don't think.  I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
Moving in?
Come on in.
Did you read ALL these books?
Thomas?
I know. Put Scott through college.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
What am I going to do with you?
Why?
Charlie. About last nights..
Congratulations.
I hope you got your money.
I asked you a question. Do you love her?
Do you love her?
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous, too.
Hey, Joel --
Are you saying you just made the whole thing up?  The guy never even existed?
Yeah.
Mother!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
What?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No goodbye.  No fuck you.  No 'Are you in love with George?'
So you're coming tonight, right?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Not yet.  It takes years of practice...
What happened?
Salem, Massachusetts?  Where all the witches were?
I'm quitting too.  Boys, not baseball.
Where?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Good morning, Lieutenant -  Sorry.
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
No, you don't.  Trust me.
Forget it, really.  I'll survive.
One of you would end up dead.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
I know exactly what you mean.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on --  I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit.  Sorry.  My kid --
You have no right here!
No, you listen. Get out!
H'm?
That's, uh...  that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
Yeah?
M'hm.
But
I was?
Well, no...
What the hell's going on?
You just passed your nemesis.
Guess what?
How did I look?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
And after that?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
So you're a one-girl guy?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
We'll let it go at that--
Yes, of course, we --
How did you meet her?
How long did you live here with your wife?
Son?
Why didn't it work out?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Oh honey.  It's spun.
I just heard.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Two years.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
And -- and --
And then --?
Why do you look at me like that?
Certainly.
Yes -- tired...
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Why don't you?
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
How do you know that?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I was, wasn't I?  I was John fucking Malkovich!  Take me back, Craig.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
This is awkward for me.  Talking about it makes me feel better.
You're my father.
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
My sixth-grade science project was entitled, “Love Hurts: The Heartbreak of Human Papillomavirus.” Trust me, I’m careful.
No. It's a down payment.
That's called changing your mind.
What!?
Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand.
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
Let me tell you something about love.  There are no prince charmings, there are no glass slippers.  Love is hard work.
Yeah.  I guess you're right.  I really like the wallpaper we picked out for the den.
...you're such a puzzle.  So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
That's the problem.
Despite you.
You never really trusted me.
What are you doing home?
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Yes, I do.
Why?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
I'm married, Ishmael.  It isn't right for us to be alone.  People will t...
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
And what is your profession?
That is why I believe in the future of my country.
I'll drop mama a postcard from somewhere. I mean, I don't want her to worry no more'n necessary.
You're excitin' me, honey. What'd she do?
Poor baby. She don't know what she missed. What color hair she have?
Oh, wonderful!
It's a crematorium.
Liz'll give you a lift.  She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob.  I've got too much to do.
No.  They don't know him.  And Ken liked you.  Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know.  It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Sure.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
Chart says he's from New York.
Yes, I should think. He called out just now.
Go ahead.  Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
We might as well start a fire.
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper—and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
You went to the party?  I thought we were officially opposed to suburban social activity.
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
What are you shooting for?
Right.
I would build a wall around me with such stone, so the likes of you might never enter.
Juliet!
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
It was on your shirt!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
I want to be alone --
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I want to be alone.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Well, it's funny!  Whatta want from me?
It happens to be a beautiful love story.  Ya know, you used to like that about me.  You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much.  That we could be together and not think...
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
How old are you?
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
'82.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
OK.
Ben?
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible.  We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete.  Okay?
And then... we rent a truck, or a car, either one, and we set up a loudspeaker, and we drive through the surrounding areas, and we page him.
Oh sure. The American answer to everything. Pills.  No, this is --  -- natural.
Of course not. Not when you've got so much going for you.
Sure! But nobody knows it. Least of all you.  Look, would you mind if I gave you some constructive criticism?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
David, perhaps you'd like to watch the telly while I take a shower.
In ten words or less?
Closet.
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
The bedroom.
Bathroom.
To chocolate?
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
He coming home right now.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
But not a good tired.
May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Ay me!
And your point?
I'd like to have lived here then. The color and excitement... the power...  the freedom.
This is me, Mike.  There's nothing else...
Almost a year.
San Francisco's changed. The things a that spell San Francisco to me are disappearing fast.
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
They called here after you left...
Do I want to be crunched?
You haven't seen her yet?
That proletarian! In the old days we'd have had her flogged.
You just told me you hadn't seen her.
Imagine the carpets of a self- respecting Parisian hotel dirtied by the boots of a muzhik! What does she look like?
That bad?  Old or young?
Wasn't that close?
I handled enough of those red pills to put everybody in New Jersey asleep for the winter.
Miss Lonely Hearts just laid out something that looks like sodium trieckonal capsules.
You know? You might not be too bad a bargain for Lisa after all.
No -- but it makes the rest easy to take. And she's reading the Bible.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
David, please --
Now. But first, he worked for you.
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself.  Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Don't you trust me?
Like what a fraud he was.
What about me?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah.
Well, get a message through to him too.
My son's name is Johnny?
'Cartwright, Wainwright, whatever your name is, I promised little Jimmy I'd be home for his birthday -- could you get a message through that I may be a little late.'
Damn.  'And Wainwright...'
'Thank you.'  How many mistake did I make?
Hey!
I never said that.
About what?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Last night.  He came to see me at my apartment.
I should like to change into a sunflower most of all. They are so <u>tall</u> and simple. And you, Harold, what flower would you like to be?
Well, it's all very thrilling, of course, but I ask you, Harold... Is it enough?
Sterling silver. It was my dear mother-in-law's, part of a dinner set of fifty pieces. It's one of the few things that survived.  Oh, but I do rattle on so. Tell me about yourself, Harold.  What do you do when you aren't visiting funerals?
Why do you say that?
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
Ugh!
Good.  They're all heatseekers!  All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail.  You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I hate it.
Are you okay?
Okay.
I don't see how we can.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Yes.
I don't know.
I did dye my hair.  It didn't have anything to do with her.  I was a redhead for a while, too.
What do you want, Nick?
I slept with her once in school.  I was just a kid.  I was experimenting.  It was just that one time.  She developed a... fixation... on me.  She styled her hair like mine. She wore the same kind of clothes I did.  It scared me.
She told you, didn't she?
Is anybody watching?
I like that one.
Willow.  To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Hey, no kidding?  In color?
See, ya.
Oh, stop that!  God! Listen, I know you like me.  I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me.  Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair.  Or some combination of the above.
The eyes.  Okay. An eye-man.  Anyhow, it never works out.  Okay?  Not that you even need to know that!  You look like crap, by the way.  What have you been doing?
What?
What's that?
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Go to your room.  And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
I love you.
Mmm. This is nice.  I always loved the way you kiss.  I missed you.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Come on, let's dance.
Do you miss her?
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
Didn't I tell you Benson and Benson were the tailors for you?
It's a dream of beauty. He never takes my word for anything, but I was right, wasn't I?
How do you do?
Nine years, we've seen each other through everything.  Losing jobs, losing parents, losing lovers... travelled all over, we've had the best times.  The best times of my life, maybe.  Just drinking and talking.  Even over a phone.
There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Oh, no.  She tells this story at every major holiday.
Clark . . . it doesn't matter . . . we can move . . .
With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said...
I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular...
Yes, but...
Yes.
Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too.
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
This must be... very, very, hard on him.
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
The English are rebuilding it.
David says Jack comes to warn him.
He's not?
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
I would say that is looked as if she wasn't coming back.
Didn't you take it to the crime lab?
Quincy...
Tsk.  Excuse me, I didn't think he had change for a hundred.
It's not for me; it's for my kids.  You're the only one I trust them with.
Goodbye, dear.
Not in my world.
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Thanks, Jack...
So did you
You looked beautiful last night, you know.
I hope so.
Yeah.  She left with some bikers Big ones.  Full of sperm.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why'd he do it?
So?
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
Yeah.  It was an unusual place to be.
I'm going over to Aaron's.  Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later.  How long do you think you'll be there?

Why Picton?
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
So?
Let me tell you something. I got groped by these Tunisian guys who thought I was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and I got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. Plus, it ended my marriage --
That's horrible!
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
I'd kick him in the nuts, if I thought he had any.
Where you headed, Betty?
Los Angeles, California.
And you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?  When I went to Europe my friends told me I was crazy.
Europe? The Europe?  This is my first time out of Kansas.
I should call you Dorothy.  When I left here I went straight to Italy. Everybody told me not to go. But I wanted to go to Rome ever since I saw Audrey Hepburn in "Roman Holiday," and goddamnit, I went.
Did you love it?
Sure I loved it! It was great.
And how I handle my <u>money</u>!
Ye-es?
Tell me, M'sieu Laval, what else is wrong?
What would you do if you were my <u>secretary</u>?
Hi, Ray.
He took the week off so we'd have time together.  So far he's worked on his boat every day.  Dad?  Ray Nicolet.
He doesn't even look like that.
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss.  But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
I drilled the bolts and went in through the window. It was the only way to bypass the smart glass.
Wait in the hall!  I have to get dressed!
Go away, or I'll call the police.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Come on, it's fun.
Never mind.
You have no personality.
Yes.
Can I talk to you a second?
We can always do that, Duff.
They won't.
You will.
Do you believe me?
Why?
Ted, I'm so sorry. Are you going to be okay?
But you never had a first date.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them.
That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you!
You leave me no choice.
Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them?
Where are they?
It doesn't mean anything.  It was written before I went out there.  Before the ho.
What about the letter?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
So he can't write.  Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Made for each other.
I dunno.  Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
Well... I might be going out to dinner.
Somebody told you.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Who told you?
Who told you?
I'll explain everything later.
Well did you or didn't you?
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
How much?
Nine!
Hey, pal.  I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine.
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Okay.
Tell him I said "hi".
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Don't say that!
Why not?
Don't you dare lie to me!  I know you love me.  Well, why don't you say something? Come on--be brilliant. Talk yourself out of it--bluff yourself in!  Shut up, you liar, you!  That's what I want!  This is real! Money! Cash!
Yeah, are you?
Yeah.
I don't know.
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I don't find this very funny,
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Please. I can't fight on an empty stomach. Remember what Napoleon said.
No. Why would I be?
You...you can't.
That sounds like fun.
-- He's in a cage?!
They keep him confined? That's bullshit!
Isn't that a little politically incorrect?
No, I mean
She'll be all right baby.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I was looking forward to this evening.
This is Captain McGann.
Thank you.  Thank you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
You've got a mustache.
Do you really want me to?
Can I take off my clothes now?
I don't.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
See food!
Uh huh, why?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
I have attorneys.  They have friends.  I have friends.  Money buys you a lot of attorneys and friends.
I wasn't talking about real friends. Why doesn't Gus like me.
Do you?
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Can I ask you a personal question?
You got a girl-friend?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana --  -- want to see his picture?
You're not well.
You know, Stewart, you failed to mention that Miss Gallagher was a very beautiful young girl.
Yes. As a matter of fact, you failed to mention that Gallagher was a girl.
Gallagher!
Oh, yes, of course. How do you do?
No.
Holly.
tried him once -
What for?
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank.  At the Roosevelt.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean.  Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe.  The older ones, they were okay.  Nice.  Polite.  Pulled the chair out for you.  But the younger ones ...  Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again.  She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart.  There are killers with palms like a baby.
Soap convention.
Your advice!
No?
How's your brother?
Cool!  We're gonna have so much fun! It's like this one time, at band camp...
No, I'm not.  I'm writing a sequence of random numbers that look like I'm doing the extra credit problems.  Mr. Bender doesn't bother to check homework past April.
Yeah, we have.  You corrupted my four- point into a three-nine-five.
Tsk, believe me, this will be the last time.
Yes.
Yes.
She talked him into it.  She wanted everything.
Well, then, sit down.
Honey, he's engaged.  And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Ellie—
Don't you like her?
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Yes.
He's okay isn't he?
He's coming over.
Yeah?  Well, fuck you.  Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Well, that's the signature -- and above, it says 'Dear Rufus -- you belong in jail.'
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Would you mind getting me a drink, Cameron?
Yeah. No, no!  No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Here. Sit down!  Quiet, egghead!  All right, now, a serious expression.
Ilene, are you crazy?
Let's go.
Right in here. The big show starts in one minute.
Good night.
I love you, too.
Is this crazy?
No.  That's the weirdest part about it.
Hello.
Egypt.
Whether or not I'm going.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
When can I talk to you?
Maybe he's wet?
No, but I think they might.
Stop it, you two!
Go home, Adam.  Go to your hotel.
I was tired.
Ha ha ha.  Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Right.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm sorry.  But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
What is it?
That something I shouldn't see?
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
Maurice Chevalier! There's a fellow with personality.
With your dry wit and humor--
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
--And he has sex appeal.
No you're not –  You're glad, because now you've got a witness.  I heard the other police talking last night.  They don't seem to like you very much.
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
I'll shoot yours off if I had a gun, you double-dealing Casanova!  I thought you liked me for myself.  But why should you, huh?  A jerk like me.
Peter, let go of the chair!
When's your birthday?
Your 33rd birthday.  The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead.  Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We don't.
No we don't.
About five years.
No.
Oooh! Here! Here!
No, I guess not.
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Yeah?
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Dead. He'd broken her neck.
No, that's not what I'm thinking.
What are you going to do with my day tomorrow, M'sieu Laval?
Um-hum ...
Um-hum ...
No, I didn't.  I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
What's this about merchandising? You always hated merchandising!
Hello?
wasn't even thinking about-
Yeah?  Well you can't fake your way through this.  You better practice.
Not radio. Let's have music that's just for ourselves.
It's... it's not like that.
I've never been here before. I wonder whom you're thinking of. Oh, I know, a girl with a map, figuring out each step, worrying about north and south. Today... now this might shock you... I went up to a taxi and said "Eight Rue du Bois"... and here I am.
For twelve francs, seventy-five.
It's nine o'clock.
Well, first I should like to take off my hat and jacket.  Then could we have some music?
Don't come any closer.
None of your business.
Yeah.  His band is playing a set.
Uh uh.
Trina honey, he just wants to find Arlyn Page.
She was with you after she left Frank.
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
Do you dance?
Well then, I must be off.  We shall have to meet again.
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
Oh, thank you. I think we shall be great friends, don't you?
Can I drop you anywhere, Harold?
Oh, of course. What is your name?
How do you do? I am Dame Marjorie Chardin, but you may call me Maude.
Honey --!
Just for the honeymoon.
Hi Loretta.
Why 're you doing this?
Well, what about it?  Let them see him!  We'll go them one better. They can also hear him.  You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
This is so patronizing.
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Oh, darling!
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
No, I'll tell him.  What am I going to tell him?
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
GET OUT!
Get out of here.
Not what you think. We're very happily married.
A couple of bloodhounds and we have Uncle Tom's Cabin.
Well... two million readers... I know exactly what they want. Chapter One: "A Childhood behind Golden Bars. Lovely Little Princess Plays with Rasputin's Beard."
Was I? No... not by a Bolshevik!
He's a waiter at the Clarence, poor devil. You know him.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
Just what the doctor ordered.
I'll be right back. Stay put.
Am I a member of this club?
Professor Roussel. There's something wrong with you. I know it.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think-  Aaaah! Okay.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
How 'you gonna live?
No.
Don't eat the red ones.
Well, it's just when I see a really good movie I really like to go out and get some pie, and talk about it. It's sort of tradition. Do you like to eat pie after you've seen a good movie?
What d'you expect?
Will you call me?
We can meet for another drink if you want.  So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared.  Like you said, I've been living with the guy.  We were bound to get around to it sometime.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it?  The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob...  Are you there?  What are you thinking?
Well of course they're me!  That's how God talks to me.  If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
It's not time yet.  My mission is not over yet.  There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
All of it.
Would you like to get some pie?
Oh, but I am!
What thought is that?
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You're not ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
What?!
I don't need pity.  I need a paycheck.  And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn.  So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
No.  I didn't.   I'm listening.
It's not a date.  It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos.  Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Yes, certainly.
Do you have any lovebirds?
Well, what is it?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
As good as humanly possible.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up.  Craig, darling are you in there?
Will you come in, please?
Please.
What do you want to bet?
Put it down or I'll shoot.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest.  Put the gun on the table.  I mean, now.
Really.  Maybe that's why you're from Homicide.  How?
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much.  You know...
A dress you wear in the evening.
Evening gown?
When you get up you put on a negligee, and then you change to a morning frock.
What do you wear in the morning?
It was very silly.... I would be ashamed to wear it here.
What was it like?
An evening gown.
As beautiful as that? What else? Come, tell me.
Yes.
You mean to tell me you wear a different dress for different times of the day?
...a monstrosity!  Who would do that?
And that's one!
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
Do you plan everything?
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Well, the meter's running, it's your money.  Speaking of which, cash'll do.  In advance.
What happens when we run out of wood?
Where then?
Well, you shouldn't  Be more aggressive, Clark! Trust your instinct! When you see your opportunity, grab it! I do.
Haven't you heard? There's an energy crisis.  No, this was good enough for my mother --
Where are they heading?
And you think Group One is at war with Group Two.
It said in the paper he drowned in a swimming pool.  <u>In Newport</u>.
You mean you are deserting Russia?
Who gave you this idea? What is responsible for all this?
What do you want with me?
Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
You know what I mean.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'm sure.
He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
It's a trap!  They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
You're naked.
No, but...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
My Westley will always come for me.
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
Yes.
I think some people are meant to be alone.  Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
What was that?
Me!  When I look around me I know I know nothing. I remember though, once long ago in Persia, we met a wise man in the bazaar. He was a professional and used to sell his wisdom to anyone willing to pay. His specialty for tourists was a maxim engraved on the head of a pin. "The wisest," he said, "the truest, the most instructive words for all men at all times." Frederick bought one for me and back at the hotel I peered through a magnifying glass to read the words - "And this too shall pass away."  Well, the wise man was right - if you remember that, you can't help but live life fully.
Of course.
How ingenious! Tell me about them.
Where are the others?
Yes.  Just don't say anything mean for a while.  Thanks.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
What do you mean clean?
You expect me to believe what, that someone came in here last night.  Gave that guy... something that stopped his heart?
Any special reason?
People do have heart attacks.
Anybody! Er, er—Beany'll do!
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Yeah?  And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
It's been a while.  Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted.  Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was.  Peter...I'm sorry.
Right.
Like love?
What are you talking about?
Hey, Barry.
Where's Rob?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Please, the children.
You kiss by the book.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You are not a loser.
I'm sorry.  I was on a roll.  I meant something else.  When do you want to leave?
Let's go.  I'll drive you. _ 45.
What'd you do?
nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I won't.  I'm a lesbian.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I was just showing emotion.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
That's not funny
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I think I would like that drink.  I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
What are you going to give me?  I hope I don't like it.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
They have to clear all the local roads of mines.  That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
I am running faster!!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
What do you want it for anyway?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
It's a test.
Fine. What do I do?
How much am I paying?
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Kings and sixes.
What for?
Put it on my account, please.
A wife?
Shouldn't you be sitting down?
No, no!  I'm sorry!  What is it?
Oh, certainly. It's to protect the species.
Yes, we call them that too.  Ahhh, here we are, Lovebirds...
No, sir, those are... redbirds.
Well, we can't just let them fly around the shop, you know.
Doesn't what make me...?
No.
You are pretty naive if you think it is.
I don't have nothing.
No.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
I sing now?
Hey, it's legit.  Strictly dinner and dance.
Oh, my God, look at her!
And I guess we didn't talk about money.  So, I'll just dive in --
No no, I know --
I brought a few of my own.
Since seventh grade.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." _ 40.
He can't. We gotta go, but he wants you to read the letter. The letter explains it all. He wants you to know he loves you. And he wants you to know that as of tomorrow, all of your money problems are over.
Bye-bye.
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it.  I was up all night and...
How much do you think you'll need?
I got twenty or so in my purse. Give me what you've got.
Ten here.
When those cops get a look at Miss Fremont -- they'll even contribute.
Well...
No.
My mistake - she's glaring.
That's it.  I went to Yale.  I hope you won't hold that against me.
Veritas.  Truth.  What is it they say about truth?
A year ago I was leaving work late one night.  Two guys tried to mug me.  It was horrible.  Jerry came out of nowhere.  To my rescue. Then he started coming to see me.  Could've been a storybook if he wasn't crazy.  At first I did my beat to avoid him.  But there's something inside Jerry and...  Jerry made me see it.  <u>He made me</u> <u>see him</u>.  That make sense?
Honestly?  I think he has a crush on me.
Holy cow!
Simon, what are you saying?!
Is that woman a complete fruit-loop or is it just me?
It's just you.
Simon, I didn't want it to end like this. We can be friends!  You'll die out there.
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Then don't.
It gets worse.
We know all that we need to know --
What was it like?
No, I don't.  He happens to deserve the credit.  He's right here.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
The thing is, Cameron -- I'm at the mercy of a particularly hideous breed of loser.  My sister.  I can't date until she does.
Gosh, if only we could find Kat a boyfriend...
Drew told me.
Will you relax?  I know it is a big deal day --
Yeah.  I guess so.
I hope so.
...Then don't.
It's just something I had.  You know
How'd you get a tux at the last minute?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Is that not enough?
Then they may read about me.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
You shoot like a girl.
You always been rich?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
Why, Craig. why?
Find that plant.  Cut out its heart.
Of course.  Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Oh my God, the others!
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
You've freed me, Jack...
I was bewitched... it's better this way...
Jack... Forgive me...
Only what's right...
Peter found him?
Why?
Peggy Lee?
You're kidding me.
Nick!  Nick!  There's someone to she you,
You can't sing at the competition.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
If I remembered you.  I came looking for you.  I would've said sure, let's do it.  But for all you knew I could show up with a SWAT team.  Why would you trust me?
If I had answered, what were you gonna say?
You like taking risks.
You really wear that suit.
Will you be good enough to run through these papers with M'sieu Giron?
And so will M'sieu Giron.
None of your business.
It's been awhile.  I'll take your word.
After two weeks of cataloguing all his faults, I made a command decision that changed my life.
Goodbye, M'sieu La-- Oh, yes ... This is a rather delicate matter and I don't want to ... You see, if you read my advertisement carefully, you must have noticed that there was ...
And loving him means loving all of this.
Enjoying your reading?
But...who...
You never fail at anything, do you, Chad?
No!  Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.

When?
You weren't there.  Give me time to get some proof.
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
No. I'm not going. Is that why you're here?
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
What the hell was that?
Okay, get in to bed.
-- Well no. It never came up.
Did I kill my mother?
We're the exactly the same!  Kit keeps telling me don't get emotional when you turn tricks -- that's why no kissing -- it's too personal. The key is like you're saying, stay numb, don't get involved -- when I'm with a guy, I'm a robot, I just do it.  Except with you.  At your price I give my all...
You liked the guy, though.
You're upset, huh?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
Some game.  Screwin' some poor slob out of his retirement.
You're trembling.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
Yes, my bag!
I keep seeing Dan Fawcett's face.  They have such big windows at the school.  All the windows were broken. In Dan's bedroom. All the windows.
Try not to think of that, Mrs. Brenner.
Do I sound foolish to you?
No.
Cathy. At the school.
Yes, I'm sure she's fine.
Do you think Cathy's all right?
What?
I wish I were a stronger person. There is a long awkward silence. She sips at her tea reflectively.
I lost my husband four years ago, you know.  It's odd how you depend on someone for strength, and then suddenly all the strength is gone, and you're alone.  I'd love to relax some time. I'd love to be able to sleep.  Do you think Cathy's all right?
NO!
I'm-I'm okay.  Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden.  I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
Then I mislay my checkbook--
He didn't make a pass at me! I told you a million times!
Yeah, and gotten yourself arrested!
Well, you were!
Peter Warne, you've gone far enough. I won't stand being insulted like this another minute.
No, I don't have time.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT  What?  Book?
Well, you sure picked the right place.  I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Yeah, sure.
Isn't this great?  They have everything here.
Corn-i-Lius?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while!  I'm just suffocating.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me.  Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Hey--I can be out of control.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
Why are you so upset?
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
I'll be waiting.
Here it is; the last chapter.
Three hundred for last night and he gave me extra to buy some clothes.  Now listen, I'm gonna leave an envelope for you at the front desk. Give me two hundred to the scum bucket and the other hundred to that asshole landlord for part of the rent.  Spend it on drugs and I'll pull your hair out.
I'm getting dressed now.  I'll be over.  Bye.
Kit, listen, the guy last night, the one in the Ferrari, I'm at this hotel, the Regent Beverly Wilshire, it's this absolutely unbelievable place and he's hired me for a whole week and Kit, listen, he's paying me three thousand bucks!  We can get out of the apartment.  We can get out of this town.  We can do anything!  Kit?  Hey, you there?
Why'd he want you?
He... he just does.
I'm sorry, Viv'.  Carlos has been on my back.  Did you get the money up front like I taught ya'?
Kit!  Where've you been?
I was asleep.  You woke me.  You okay?
Me?
Business.
I'm gonna go to jail.  I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
What do you think I've got?  A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too.  Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Yes.
To show you this.  It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler.  He wrote it to me the day after I saw him.  He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
Biting you?
No, thank you.
Who do?
Let's get outta here... I suddenly got a funny feelin' about this place. Feelin' all that voodoo...
Oh my God... It's Johnnie... Duck down!... Get goin'!
Any time, sailor.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Like your story is over.
How come it feels the same?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
How long have you lived here?
Well... I've been on blind dates before... Matter of fact, to be honest, I've been picked up before.  Okay.
Give it back!
That!?!
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Petty good.
I don't understand. What about you?
But why my name, Richard?
I came to tell you what a swell guy I think you are to do this--
Oh, this is Betty.
You too, Lieutenant.
It's just a party. Daddy.
At least I'm not a clouted fen- sucked hedge-pig.
Like I'm supposed to know what that even means.
It's Shakespeare.  Maybe you've heard of him?
Daddy, no!
Are you arresting me?
And then I'll see you in New York --
Not for the kind of place I want to do.  I won't be in Chicago that long.
Josie Grossie.
Do you get nervous in small confined spaces?
I'm a little worried about the...  ...about how much bleeding is okay.
Ya think?
I don't know.
You were not baptized.  At least I don't believe it was Christian.  Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
Okay.  ... I love you...
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I thought so.
Why not?  They seem friendly enough.
I said you can be too crude sometimes? I don't think I care for it.
That's true. Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle. He was a business partner of my daddy's? And my mama never knew nothin' about me and him - that's for damn sure. His real name was somethin' kind of European, like Pucinski. But everyone just called him Pooch. He came around the house sometimes when Daddy was away. I always figured he was sweet on mama, so when he cornered me one afternoon, I was surprised more'n a little.
You're terrible crude sometimes, Sailor, you know?
Maybe I was there, but I didn't see anythin'. All I know's that trash killed a man with his bare hands. Hands which are now prob'ly all over my baby!
Sailor, you are somethin' else, honey... When I was fifteen, Mama told me that pretty soon I'd be startin' to think about sex, and I should talk to her before I did anything about it.
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
You can't talk underwater!
Call the police!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Help me!!
Help me!!!
So go.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
Bye, Joel.
Normal.
Hello, Walter.  Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Editorials?
It doesn't seem to be in any hurry.
Oh. Right.
It is?
I think it should be outlawed.
It's all right, Susan. Yes, Doctor, I have.
--I know what I'm talking about. I'm no high-school girl looking through a window--reaching for the moon.  Guess I'll be going.
Slowed things down?  Where have I been?  Have we been going fast!?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Will he keep his word?
Yes, Monsieur.
I'm eleven and a half.
Oh, yes, please.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
No, but my guess is they're headed west, so prob'ly Texas. Their money must be runnin' low. I don't think Sailor had much to begin with, if any, and Lula took the six hundred she had saved in the Cherokee Thrift.
Listen, Johnnie, Lula just called me. She knew you were in N.O., so they left the city.
No.  I just came by to apologize.
It seems like ever since I found out about this guy, this name, I've been kind of crazy.  Like I was on drugs or something.
Yeah...  Well, anyway, I also wanted to tell you, I'm not getting married.
Could she be doin' okay, Johnnie? She's tryin' to prove somethin' to me, that's all. Lula ain't doin' no more'n showin' off, defyin' me...  Johnnie, I've done somethin' bad...
I've got to see you alone!
Tea would spoil my dinner.  One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
That.
Have you seen it?
Dictation.  You know...
Jesus.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Do I seem jumpy?
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
This is hysterical.
I'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.
It just happened.  I didn't plan it.  I was alone.  And he was... there.  But now everything's changed.  I owe it to him to let him know.  I need to tell him.
Stolen?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Ted...?
But I think I'd be happiest... with you.
Get over here.
Oh yeah, that'd make golf real fun -- the guy doesn't even drink beer or gamble.
What are you going to do?
Huh?
No, this happened to me once, almost, it was excruciating!
Ju...
I've missed a step.
You're enshrined in his heart and memory.  Unassailable. Which works out great.
Jesus, we're trapped!
He has you on a pedestal.  And me in his arms.
Dr. Hirsch will know what to do.
The next corner we can get a cab.
This is so embarrassing...
Penny.  I'd rather not reveal my last name or my age.
Who do they think I am?!
Let's forget it--can't you see I kind of like you, too ... and I don't want to get involved.
Sorry, boss—
Yeah?
It'll be ready in a minute.
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
I smiled at him.
Should I wait up?  We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Coming to bed?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
I... I am Rheya.  But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Okay.
You should stay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah? Oh, great!
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
Go on.
No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after.
That's not the way to win him back... not Leon.
I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow.
I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova.
Thanks.  But either way it still feels...
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn’t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over £1,000 to get rid of him.
The £1,000 is on account.
They're killing him!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight.  Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Did you make any change in this room?
-- we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.
Honey, I don't think this is really relevant to...
Glenn, are you trying to steal this car?
You mean they don't have hookers.
You're allergic to hay.
That's not why I'm here...  ...  though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Yes.
Hunh-uh.  What's that?
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
What?
What is it?
You want my number?
Giovanni.
Doctor Rumack, Mister Hammen ate fish. And Randy says there are five more cases, and they ate fish, too.
He had fish, too.
Just how serious is it, doctor?
Don't eat anything.
But you were pulling your hips last night.
Young men are uncomplicated.  And he's not "dim".  He's just inexperienced.  My job is to give him "life-wisdom" and help him make it to the major leagues.
No!
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and <u>him</u>... She didn't even look at him.
I'll need that.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Sweet.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
Fine. They were created during a dictatorship.  What if something happened to you? What would I tell little Gus when he asked "what was my daddy like?"
We have to wait and see. I think that, for *everything* in life, you have to wait and see.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
Sort of.
You rat.
I'm not in danger.  I have a dead bolt. Remember?
I've got a lulu -- why?
Cornelius..
I didn't say that.
The town looks clear.
You are cruel!  Your heartless jesting worse than torture!  How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
But I'm hideous!
Grotesque... monstrous...
You lie!  You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
God protect me.
No.
Yes, please.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
This would be it?
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Nice... Very interesting... Great!  ... I guess.
Yes, it does.
That's my real name, really. I got proof. See.
Look for yourselves.
Good morning, Comrade Commissar. Here is my report on the materials available for trading in the next four months.
That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
I'd use the word insane.
No.
I was just talking a walk.  I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them.  I hate my life.  I just hate it.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.
Yes!  I don't know!  I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does.  We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill.  Big deal.  So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
I think it's time we got some professional help.
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I meant about my idea.
"I want to meet you..."
Just ask it!
Sure.  For five bucks.
Did you speak to the Governor?
Are you crazy!?
I'm a ballplayer.  If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I never asked you to choose.
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
Darling!
What'd you give him for the car?
Yes.
Oh, you've been hurt! There's a cut on—
What happened?
Yeah, right!  That's where you'd go to find girls!  Nome.  He's gay, by the way.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
No.
No, I won't go with you
You're amazingly self-assured. Has anyone ever told you that?
Is that a request or a command?
Because I don't want to. It's a stupid tradition.
Till today, I haven't believed a word.  Now, I'm curious.  Six months, eleven days.  I'm going to give you one more hour to impress me.  Where to?
Yes!
The suspects!  They won't come.
Unh-huh. Which would make you half angel.
Maybe try the opposite of that.
Okay, can I just ask you something? What do you know about your mom?
A mountain goat? That's really sweet.
Try an angel.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
It's gone now.
Lower. Same page.
Better. I was really angry.
You can't even give me that?!  What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life...  ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else?  What were you planning to do, Jack?
No.  So what time do you need?  I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great!  I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that!  So what do you need to figure out alone!?
Uh, the scampi sounds good to me, too.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
I mean until we start to burn up.
What's in this? Nitro-glycerin?
Well... I have to get to work tomorrow morning, for one thing.
I couldn't possibly. I have to get back.
Cheers.
Whatta you mean "why not"?  Are you gonna play forever?!
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
Omigawd, honey, I'm so happy for you.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Yes! Hi.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't get away just yet.  I'm at Aaron's.
Hi.  It's me.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I'm not sure.  It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
I won't, Earl.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
After that, I swore I'd never do anything just because "everyone else" was doing it.  And I haven't since. Except for Bogey's party, and my stunning gastro-intestinal display --
But
May I use the phone please.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
No. you didn't!  If you really thought I could make my own decisions, you would've let me go out with him instead of helping Daddy hold me hostage.
You don't know.
Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress.
Actually, I'm a movie star out for a walk.
Who are you, Jerry?
Jerry, there's something I have to ask you.  Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question.  To my satisfaction.
It was that painting.  The one on the wall.
Well, I liked you.  You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Yeah, sure.  More so then than I am now.  That's life though, isn't it?
I remember the song.  I just couldn't remember who sang it.
You really believe that?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Ilene, Rick promised...
Oh, no.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Our kind of women?
So?!  Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
Uh...yeah.
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
I know, but...
Sooner--if you like.  See you again, I hope.
A little bad luck?
Thanks.  Will you fix my hair?
Okay, a lot of bad luck.  But that means the odds are probably in your favor now.  This is no time to give up.
So you're just quitting?  Just like that?
Sure... What's Grace up to?
Kimmy, he doesn't know what's going on. He doesn't even know he's in a -
It's too soon even to - <u>talk</u> about that!
I should be in by two.
Oh, Well, thank very much. But no thanks.
Tomorrow m -- but I have to go to work. I've got a job.
And what will I live on? My oil wells in Texas?
Tomorrow night? Well --
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
I'll be waiting.
To tell you the truth, I can't believe I've made it this far. It may not be Europe, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
Congratulations, Enzo.
Why don't you return this car and borrow mine? Have Debi follow you to the rent-a-car so you can get a ride back.
Yes, they give me headaches. I have a headache.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
What is he doing there?
Because you were afraid to fly.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock.
I’m desperate to start but I don’t have an addictive personality. Except for approval. That, I can’t get enough of.
What?
What are you talking about?
Maybe I could jump out of the window.  Do you think they'd see me?
That's Father at work, What'll I do?  Peter, what'll I do?
Something I've been wondering, what ever happened to your Uncle Cully?
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
But why talk about robbery on a night like this?
Great.  What do I look like a tourguide?
We're doing this together. We're partners.
Peter, where are you?
Why's it here?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
What's all this pudding?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
You don't get the Mask code unless I go.
Good night, Steve.
There's a nice boy.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Like what?
I don't know the meaning of the word guilt!
Oh, no!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
...I do.
They don't blame you. When a bank employee does this they understand. You get your life back. Anyway I bet you hated that bank.
So what are you going to do?
Why else would you send off for me? If you just wanted sex just go to a prostitute.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
She died right in front of me. Why'd she have to go and do that, Sailor?
I can't take this, Sailor. She's dyin' right in front of our eyes...
I said you were a loser!
We have nothing to discuss.
Now there you are completely wrong. If we sit down for a little chat, I'm sure we won't run out of conversation and what's more it won't be dull.
Madame, what is it you people always say, regardless of what you mean... "I am delighted to have you here"? I have not reached that stage of civilization.
That's all right... I grow on people.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
I must ask you to leave.
Terry...?
Leave? That's exactly what I came here to ask you to do. Leave! I don't mean this hotel and I don't mean Paris... I mean France. There's a plane for Moscow at five-forty.
Madame, if you...
Don't worry. I have already made reservations. It's perfect flying weather. They assure me there's a fine tail wind which will sweep you back to Moscow in no time.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
On your first time --
It was my New Year's resolution to overcome it.
Says who?!
You can't print that!
What?
Why?
I'd better go in.
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
It's fine.
Don't curse.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat.  Where's that card?
Did he tell her?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
There you go.
It's not that --
No. I can't. Not yet.
Nothing.
Oh, come on. You’re like the Yoda of escorts.
Her mother told me most of then before she died. I dug out the rest for myself, here.
She is not my wife.
Okay.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
I love him.
If you're waiting for "Do you take this man?", that's considered poor form.
Yeah!
Really?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I'm paying you.
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes, I did, John. But I—I had no idea what was going on.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
I already bought a ticket.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Yes.
Yes.
See! I knew you had it all under control.
Maybe I did... Try New Orleans first... Lula can't ever stop talkin' 'bout that town.
Oh, you see an analyst?
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
Fifteen years?
But you knew this was important to me.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty.  She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl.  I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I said, is she Italian girl?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
He didn't say very much.  Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
I can't believe we did this.  Do I have to remind you that your wedding is in six days?
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What?  I'm sorry, talk.
Does Dwayne know about this?
Would you stop saying that?  I need you to do me a really big favor.
Of course not.  I told him I was going to visit a great aunt.  And don't tell Larry, either.
You're really pushing it, bringing me here.
What id we run into someone I know?
I want him to at least see the sky!
No, Calvin.  We're not going to make do.  Not me!  Not Adam.  We're going up no matter what!  We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
And the ocean!  A mountain range!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness!   Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now.  I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we  need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Jeff -- isn't it time you came home? You could pick your assignment.
Someday you might want to open up your own studio here.
You can't buy that kind of publicity.
She looked very cool. She had on a mint green --
Not a bit. I was all morning in a sales meeting. Then over to the Waldorf for a quick drink with Madame Dufresne -- just over from Paris. With some spy reports. Back to the "21" for lunch with the Harper's Bazaar people -- that's when I ordered dinner. Then two Fall showings -- twenty blocks apart. Then I had to have a cocktail with Leland and Slim Hayward -- we're trying to get his next show.  Then I had to dash back and change.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
No. It's nothing.
Nothing.
What's up, Babe? Something's eating you.
I can't write it, Mabel! I don't know what's the matter with me.
Don't be ridiculous.
You haven't gotten very far, have you? That's where you were an hour ago. Come on, let's knock off and go down to Joe's. The gang's waiting for us.
Everybody knows --
Ohh!
Just a minute...
Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that?
I know, no--  I know.
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
Uh-huh.
Easily.
What'd you fight, middleweight?
Flyweight.
Larry, did you rent a car?
He's gone.  He told me what happened.  He just left for the airport.
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
How?
I got you, Del...
I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
...like the water purifiers?
Or the vitamins? Or the...?
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Gilbert!
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Don't.  It's horrible.
Give it back Nicholas!
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I hope everything goes all right.
Films mainly.
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean.  I-I... I can't put it into words.  The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
You think so?
Did you change your hair?
May I have a drink?
How are you?
Uh-- APRIL  I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
Hello, Benjamin.
Right.
To calm my anxiety.
Clear?
Come with me...
You don't know who she was, Annie --
I saw her.  She looked just like this --
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Me? Oh, downtown!
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
... luckiest guy in the Northern Fucking Hemisphere, is all I'm s...
David?
Try me.
Yes.
I want you to take care of Sailor, so he won't ever be able to bother my baby again.
Lula's gone off with Sailor.
Santos... It isn't.
That's not why I called.
Why not?
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing.  The best thing for you. I promise.
I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town.
Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest?
Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and...
Mmm.
Dysfunctional --
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
Yeah.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera.  An architect.
Let's do that.
Isn't that beautiful?
Oh, they just do it to sell the newspapers, you know.
You're worried about those articles they're writing about you, aren't you?
Why don't you try?
There's Times Square.
Homework. It's more interesting.
He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
You ratted on my mother??
Tell me about it.
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
Well, what're you going to do?
There goes another scrub lady.
Smart aleck!
Do you mind putting out the light?
How does it feel to get that much money just for being you?
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Are you okay?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
I'm Kathryn.
Annette Harrison.
Write me well.
Sleeping pills.
Doctor.
What are you doing here?
I have that date -- remember?
You know I do.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that’s what they do to their employees, isn’t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people’s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Is it intelligent?
Is it a planet?
Yes.  But not until you mentioned them.  As soon as you said those things, I remembered them.  And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember.  It's like filling up.
What do you mean?
Yeah. Funny twist, isn't it?
Well, he looks miserable. What were you talking about?
What, as a sales rep?
Mmm.
Doesn't she look pretty?
Don't leave me.
Come on.
No, they're all right.  I meant, you just got here.
You're lying.
You're a bit eccentric, aren't you?
Really?
won't even pretend it isn't a very great favor. I wish there was something I could do for you—
Spangler says we have a relationship.
I saw Mr. Faber.  You remember Mr. Faber, don't you?
Hello, Bob, it's me.
What did you expect? Frankie still has a good string, three girls. Figure three hundred a week from each.
You asked me where I got that date with the dumper -- Frank sent me on it.
Can't you get him?
Open it.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing.  I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Is everything getting worse?
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For $300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
You lived in Chicago?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger.  You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
You made their funding disappear!
Do I?  No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid.  Or maybe a closed one.  Pretty. What are they?
Yes.
I guess that's where everyone meets him.
Thank you.
Lovebirds.
Mmm.  Well, good luck, Miss Daniels.
What made it...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
What the hell's going on?
David, I don't... Can we talk privately for a second?
Switch?  What fucking switch?
Hi.
Thanks, Melvin.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
I would've come back for you.
I've never seen him before in my life. I'm just trying to help you out.
He's after us again!
A perk for what?
Does he have to go?
I'll tell him.  What is it?  Is it a mine?
No, I don't, I don't.
Hello....congratulations.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Oh...like Moses.
So how do we do this?
What's she like?
Tell him I'm on vacation.  That I won't be back for two weeks.
Not today...
There's no way to practice this. And no time. Besides, I've planned it all. There aren't any surprises.
That's where the Mask comes in.
We're doing it tonight.
That's the beauty of it. There's only one tiny window of time when this will work. At the handover of Hong Kong--from Britain to China. The handover from them to us.
Yes.
No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a "V".
He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming.
His hair... any color.
See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it.
Grandma!
Yeah... It could be fun.
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
What about Grace?
You like it?
Maybe.
Well, it's almost over.  We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
How did you know?
What about you?
I don't believe it.  You're a romantic, Frank.
Well, I'll have to look someplace else.
I'm pinch-hitting for our society editor tonight. I wanted to see some life in the raw.
There you are—!
Mr. Smith, I've read some of your plays and I'd like an autograph.
Say, who's been tying your ties lately? It looks rotten.
This has been a real confusing day.
Okay, good.  I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Fuck legal terms.  We're talking about human beings here.  Sick people.  A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years.  They need their money now!  We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed.  We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
Oh Jack, mightn't I touch one?  It would thrill me so.
I don't understand.
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
...I don't know.
Where was that, Florence, huh?
... best valley in New Zealand, best... women's shoes...
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains.
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment.
Exactly.
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff—
Of course it's the reason.  It's terrible what you did.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It made me ill.  You could get fired for things like that.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
Then let's change the subject.  What do you think about forced school busing?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
You plan on driving trucks all your life?
Okay.
Do I know? I'm an authority on it.
I don't really think you warrant that strong an emotion.
Frankly, once you've seen Superman in action, Niagara Falls tends to leave you cold.
Okay.  Did you bring a condom?
I don't want to go home.
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
And there?
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows...  I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to...  do their... work.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
When he dies I'll catch up.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Let me come, too.  Please don't leave me alone.
Here in the canyon.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Yeah?
Daniels.
What name?
Thank you.
D'you want me to order one for you?
Of course.
Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat?
Where would I get a boat?
Mmmmmm.  'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do.
I wonder if you could tell me...
Okay.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Hey, are you hungry? I'm hungry.
And you tore up your knee.  Rehab is tough.
That doesn't make sense.  Repeat analysis.
Intermitant failure in scan mode "R". Analyze.
A maid must beware of flattery... Methinks you want to kiss me.
If I were your bride, would the kissing ever stop...?  Do you wish to marry me, Jack?
Nay, Jack, I'm but wary of your intentions.
What difference does it make?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Yes!
I found it!
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You don't love me, is that it?
Is there somebody else?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
Here you go.  One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
Out-of-town.  That's all he'll say.
No.
I got things to do.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fiancé's in Palermo.
I don't think you're normal.
What gives?
Go where?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Who was that?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
The poem! I knew he liked the poem!  Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
What?
Right.  Okay, fire a couple in there.
You're patronizing me!  I will not be patronized--
The pingala is the nostril used for throwing a baseball.  And if you discover before a game you're in the wrong nostril, it's easy to switch.
A little better.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
We're taking a flight?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
So what's your novel about?
Yeah, weird. But great.
You can’t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you...  ...who knows what would’ve happened if you hadn’t stepped in at the store.
We were young...  Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
<u>You</u> made coffee?... You're going back to work <u>and</u> you made coffee?... I love this!
<u>Whoah</u>!  Oh, honey, that's terrific!
You're kidding!  What did he say?
So what's going on?  Who's Lou again?
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.
Oh, Will!
I am, too.
Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I believe you.
Your will!  Your will!  What else could it be?
The art of transformation!
Me!
That's a date.
You'll excuse me.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Sorry?
I... If you don’t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There’s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
I... Well, we’re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it’s late and with the funeral...
Tempestuous?
No -- I'm cleaning an attic.  I wouldn't attempt the impossible.
This is certainly... ah...
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Goodbye--Madame Colet and Company!
Don't tease me.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me— who?  -- who?
What do you want, Melvin?
What do you want?
I don't want to fight, George.
Six-fifty.
It's a birthday present for my cousin. Put your finger in.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
What are you doing here?  Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Sort of.
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.
What?
Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking.  We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
So it wasn't real.
No, that wasn't a lie.  That was...  a mirage.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
No, I'm serious.  You know what Kurt Potter is?  He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG&E offered 20 million.  He doesn't work like us, Ed.  There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Do you love him, Loretta?
A wolf without a foot!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Because I have no Luck!
No!
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Will you send me some cigarettes, please?  Comrades, I am not in a position to pass final judgment but at best you have been careless in your duty to the State.  You were entrusted with more than a mere sale of jewelry. Why are we peddling our precious possessions to the world at this time? Our next year's crop is in danger and you know it. Unless we can get foreign currency to buy tractors there will not be enough bread for our people. And you three comrades...
Comrade Buljanoff...
Do you spell Buljanoff with one or two f's?
You didn't get legal advice?
I will not repeat your mistake. I will have no dealings with the Grand Duchess nor her representative.
He's in the living room asleep.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
... It's a comfortable place.
The Mamma's there too.
It's time somebody ate *them*.
I'm late for lab.
Right. 7:30.
Remember, that poet that we liked – the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Daddy, it's a letter to *me*.
– uhh, must have forgotten-
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Nope.
Oh--a hundred times--
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Commentary.
Of course it is! Are you doubting me?
Send me a plate of raw carrots and beets, beets predominating on a ratio of sixty-forty... What? There is a strike in the kitchen? Good! Will you assure the strikers of my hearty sympathy in their cause. I hope they will not weaken in their demands and tell them to put no dressing whatsoever on my vegetables... What? You won't serve me either? Now look here, Comrade, I think it is a fine idea to let the capitalists go without luncheon but when you keep food away from me you're weakening the people.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
What are you wearing?
Kiss me.
Good.
Don't call them that.
Really? And how are you, eh?  Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Correct!  Good night.
Don't you like that?
Yeah.  Like I said, I don't want to take sides.  And I like Laura with you.  She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together.  I just wish you two could, I don't know.  I don't think much of this Ian guy --
How're you holding up?
Unless you wanna tell me.
My dad's retired.  He was a Private Investigator.  Forty years.  I used to work for him.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
Do you really have to go?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You and me -- making love.
When I was seeing Carl Tillman, I didn't know he robbed banks.
What is it?
We're saved!
Only what?
A phone message.  Only--
Where have you been?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
You don't.
Would you like to see that?
Sure.
She’s your dog, Jack.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Here you go...
Jack...
No, why should I? It's yours.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Oh, it's not bad.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eggs. How do you like them?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
What are you <u>doing</u>?  Where's George?
What?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Who do you think did it?
George!
Mimi!
I don't remember.
What?
Him?
College?
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
What is it? Has he found him?
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
He's all right.  Isn't that enough?
NASA.  Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Yes... a half-steed... white.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
My king.
No.
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play.  I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
No no no no no no no no no...
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
-- what?  -- I'll see you later...
No, no, I want to. I'll just go into the village.
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Thank you.
Gee, that is a problem.
Oh... wandering about.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Hi there.
This is California, anything is possible.
How are you?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I'm okay.
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Meet Nick.
What are you doing here?
God.
Leave him!
How old is she?
Oh, she'll love it.
Yes.
I better go check on them.
This is really awkward...
Yes.
What complicated about it?  All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Uh... uh...  Umm... long time.
No, really?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Frank's touchy about his cousins.  Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room.  I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
It's so cruel.
You need a few dollars.
Course he ain't never killed nobody. Why'd you say that, Pace?
Like you, sweetheart. You and your daddy got the same mouth, eyes, ears, and nose. Only difference is your color hair is like mine.
Why, Pace Roscoe Ripley, ain't you got one cute mouth tonight?
Nothin', honey.  Mama's just actin' strange.
And?
All I've heard, from the day I met Michael, is Julianne this, and Julianne that...
What's that got to do with it?
I mean, romantically.
I never thought it made sense, though, the way they got together so quick.
With Robert Redford, when he was young.
You have to be kidding.
You'd probably tell me.
Don't turn. I'm counting the steps to the entrance.
You can't be too careful.
Ready.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I don't think so.  Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
Sorry.  It's the first time I've ridden "piggy-back" in years.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
Truth'll set you free.  I'm listening.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
What do you think it is?
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been *wonderin'* about it!
That's *it*?
Request; self-analysis of ROK hardware and software systems regarding behavioral changes.
My name is Jeanne.  My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me.  I would like to have it back.
It's just... up there... right in front of Walter's... y'know, computer. If memory serves.
We could use... his computer, to... just E-mail those suckers right ou...
I'm up against a deadline.
That's my point!!
Not if what he left me was real.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Yes.  Nick!
She was just too young for you.
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Well, I wouldn't go so far as to call him nice, but he's treated me pretty decent. But I've only been there about four days. He got a little rough with Arlene the other day.
Why would they tow your truck?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Money?
Nope, haven't walked the plank yet.  There was this guy back in college who was bothering me... got kind of ugly -- a restraining order, the whole bit. Anyway, when I got out of Princeton I changed my name as a precaution.
Lucky lady. Hi.
Oh, Ted I'm so sorry to hear that.
Oh. So... what brings you down here?
Well you look great. Are you married, do you have kids?
Actually, it's Mary Brooks now.
"Frenzy".
You sending me home?
Oh, Andy.
And I'll give then proof!
Mother!
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
Huh?
No kidding?
The both of them?  In there?
I'm not running.
Oh. So what's it doing here?
I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic.
Oh, yeah?
H'm?
No.  You're a wreck.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Ronald?
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
No, that's fine.  I love that you tried... time was I'd have done the same.
Are you okay?
Not since November.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Well, what if this guy's just playing with you? What if he's lying about who he is?
You should have a little faith in people.
No, please. Go ahead, it's your funeral...
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
You've read The Fountainhead?
I'm pretty hungry. When I went to the store I was gonna get some Ding-Dongs.
You're going to finance him, I suppose.
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
In a month.
Mm-mm!
...any sister talk?
What's happened?  Kip!  What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Going back, huh?
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Okay.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in.  I'll let you get back to work.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Who is he, Pop?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
You have to learn how to take a complement.  Movies, movies, ahhhh, &quot;Love Story&quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
In lieu... &quot;instead&quot;.... No contest.
What do they say?
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
How much?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh?  Over and over. Like a song.
Yeah.
Sneak out in the morning.  Before the guy could wake up and ruin it.  Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Why didn't you come to me?
Oh, Lotte...
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte? Is that you?
And you'll go on saving me? Again and again?
Twice a year.
How do you know this place?
Thanks.  They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Is there anything more I could --
Oh golly, oh just what I've always dreamed of, dirty phone calls.  How come?
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
What do I do meanwhile? -- wait for that clown to fall through the skylight on me?
Darling, Peter says I could stay…
Well, I need grass and so do you.
Let's just do it, all right?
Oh, you have my body.
That you were just indulging me.
You'd be great, just great...  'Cause you understand non-linear thinking even though it seems like baseball is a linear game 'cause of the lines and the box scores an'  all--but the fact is that there's a spacious-"non-time kind of time" to it...
Oh he can hold you. He weighs two- hundred-and-thirty pounds.
Oh, are you on the team?
Hey, you're limping. Did you just hurt yourself?
It's okay Joe.
It's a no go, Joe.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
I hope she's all right.
What does that mean?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Hi, Leonard.
That's right.
Poster-Kleiser.
Fine.
All of it?
Mom's going to hate it.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
This?
No.
That was so weak.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
I like your nails.  Where did you get them done?
Ah... I do them myself.  I used to work in a beauty parlor.
The Baron is a frightful man.  They say he's an ogre.  He wears a mask so none may see his face.
Yes!  They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Liar!
It's my father, gone a-hunting.  The Baron Couer de Noir is his guest and must be provided with some sport.
You promised!
But you did... you did!
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
Well, I'm sure a nice southern boy like you will figure something out.
I'm sorry. It's really tough when your parents get older.
My dad's an optometrist.
Why are you laughing?
Really?
But I found the money.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Swear to god.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Dad, did you do it?  Did you take that money?
What am I supposed to think?
Sure.
Really?
Well, to-- new friends.
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I'm ready.
Are you gonna do it?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
It's not cool?
Get that out of your trunk.
Right. Right.

I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox!  Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal.  Oh look. Class is over already.
I wanted to stop it, I ran up to stop it --
Hi!
Your accident...
Ça alors! From Charles?
I was raised in a Baptist church got dipped in the water when I was 5-- born again before kindergarten...by the time I was 10 I knew it was bullshit and at 15 I ran away from home...
God damn you--what is happening? Is there no man who'll have me?  This is the weirdest season I ever saw--the Durham Bulls can't lose and I can't get laid!
Va jouer, mon ange.
I crossed the street--it was the New York Yankees spring training field--tok, tok, tok, was the sound of a ball hitting a bat-- and I sat in the warm bleachers to think about my mother...  And I saw him.
No shit.  They expensive?
Because!  Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What do you mean, they won't come?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
Has he been refusing food?
Oh! You're supposed to fasten it!
Except it’s Scotch.
He... He is dead!  MY HUSBAND IS DEAD!  Call my parents. They’ll tell you. Call them!
Do you think we’d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
What are you doing? You can’t. I...
No. Not us...
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Well, you're catching on.
John Doe.
I'll convince you.
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
Maybe I'm losing interest in my book.
Do you believe me?
I'd read about your shootings in the papers.  I decided to write a book about a detective.  I wanted to know my character.
I would've paid more.  I wanted to know everything about you.  Then you came down here after Johnny got killed... it gave me a chance to get to know my character better.
Why?!
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
That’s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
No -- never.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
Guess who I saw today.
Who?
I'm not sure now. She said he used to be over at Loma Vista. I never heard of it.
ON TELEVISION!!  Cut the shit, will you!
Either you're making a fool out of me because you get off on it, or you got serious problems. Which one is it?!
Doctor David Ravell.
What? Where was he?!
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I'M TALKING ABOUT DAVID RAVELL!!
Get away, get away!!
I want to be at one with Him now.
I've been thinking about that.  I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance.  You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Don't push me, Frank.  I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
Thanks for the jolly news. I thought maybe you'd left town by now. You kind of just disappeared. But you boys from Tuscarora have a habit of disappearing, don't you?
Thank you.
Yes.
I'll help you with the coffee.
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I was there for that shot, actually.
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I didn't.  I just realized I already knew.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
How 'bout I come next Sunday and watch the Super Bowl with you?
I really gotta go.
Please!  Thank you.
Two lumps, madame?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
And you know what I thought then, Kate?  I thought, I hope someday I have somebody who loves me that much.  I still hope that.
I know.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Alright.
I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Where were you?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
That was a long time ago.
That's Skid Row... isn't it?
Gavin? Gavin Elster? You'd think I'd would. No.
Three whole weeks.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Exactly.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
I'll be right back.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
What kind of things come up?
So what are you thinking?
Whoa.  No shit.
Are you all right?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
County water board.  All righty, thanks.
You could at least look at me!
You want this ticket?
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike...  You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Okay...
You promise not to say anything?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Oh.  I was putting the...
I can see why.
Goodnight, Joe.
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
Don't give me that.  Kit gave it to you yesterday, cash.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
Am I wrecking my car?
Never mind.  That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Maybe even my destiny.
Me?
Coming to the Okeechobee exit...
Take the next exit.
Isn't that my report you're holding onto?
I wanna be on the task force, Daniel.
Glenn, take the exit.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
What is your problem?  I'm trying to help you.  Why won't you let me help you?
Yes you do.  Something's on with you.  You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
That bastard!
Who told you that?
Well... a shot at it.
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech.  A dickhead.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Forget it.  I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
You're lost?
What job?
What are you doing here?
I wasn't asleep!!
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women.  Do you all know this story?
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure…
Candaules…you're laughing at me.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him.  And hearing his story, she said this -
Why do they keep calling you George?
Off the boulevard.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
If this is meant to be a joke it is not funny. Or do you still think you're issuing orders from your palace in Petrograd?
My palace in Petrograd... yes, you took that away from me. You took away my czar, my country, my people, everything I had...  but nothing more -- I warn you.
Who's winning?
Here, boy!
No. It'd be useless. Father'd get the wire before they would.
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up?  To go have sex with him?  I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot.  If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
Hi.
The Big Hurt, huh?
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Walter and I are engaged!
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
You know, we know each other.
Hello, there!
He's never forgotten a promise to me.  I'm worried about him.  I know something's happened to him.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Not for long...
Doesn't sound very exciting.
What are you thinking about?
You sound like a hobo.
Really?
Request; life support systems check.
You were saying...
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
We thought we were something, didn't we?
What is it about?
Who is it from?
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
You...  Jesus Christ!
I can’t believe this...  What’s coming now, eh? If I don’t pay all Hell’s gonna break loose, is that it?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess.  You want money, right?
I beg your pardon.
Mother, I promise you that he won't be a reporter much longer. Once I get him away from that atmosphere and get him away from a man named Gallagher—
I like "godsend."
If he files are you going to take the case?
She sounds like quite a woman.
The fuck I'm not.  I don't care what the doctor says --
When?  Where?
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
In your pocket, please...
Okay.
I don't want it reported!
We'd go to his car.
Hello, darling.
Why, no—I—  Yes . . . I guess I will.
I always liked him. Especially last year in Munich ...
Yes -- yes -- yes.
And now?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
So --
I wanted you to know -- now -- I'm very proud.
The gear is down.
But what?
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You? No.
I'm so glad you didn't jump on that train, before...
Take that back.
I know it's yours.
You sing.  All the time.
Actually, you sing.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Right now, I just don't care.
A friend dropped me off.
Goodbye, my boy.  Take care of Dorothy.  Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
George.
It's only eight o'clock.
He could live with us.
I beg your pardon!
Driver!
Have you got my dough?
Come on with that money!
Sor-ry  We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Well, what should we do?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
No.
I don't think so.
Yes.
Are you going to leave me too?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah.  I jus--
That's an evasion.
What do you expect me to say?
Why, you know the situation.
Not because of me, I hope.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close.  She'd tell me such a thing.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Wow. It's packed.
Wait till you see what I have on underneath.
No.
Do you?
You got it, stud.
No you haven't.
Do you love her?
He's such a loser!
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, perfect!  He reminds me of Ichabod Crane.  His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH  Listen.  He's a lot better than your ex-husband.  He's got a good job.  Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it.
Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams.
See.  Dry.  It's in the delivery.
Can you watch the road?
You can't believe what it'd cost to bring in a temp.
... you want a menage on your wedding night.
How do you know?  Wait-- you have my wallet.
Muncie.
YOU KNIT?
It's just for a couple of months.
You're missing the game for us?!
What about the game?!
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack?  Answer me?!
Hello.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
George.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
What about the Mayor?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Mom liked it.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Let's go, Duff.
That's impossible.  I'm a doctor, I'm --
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time.  I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
I'd love to go there one time...
My treat. You were saying... something about how stupid you've been?
Then do as you're told. Get her back.
Kinda like you'd been saying it since you got on the plane...
No, why?
You miss me?...
Metaphorically, I still don't have an Amana freezer.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
Anything is possible.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
Well, it happens.
... your one chance for true happiness?
You never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover.  As they say in the sport biz.
I want it understood.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
You always get what you want?
And now?
The moment I saw you.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I don't think we were the first.
Oh my God.
What?
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
The average man would go after the reward. All you seem to—
You were taken for a buggy ride?
Here you are.  Do you mind if I ask you something frankly?  Do you love my daughter?
No--proud. Very proud!
But don't they have it in English?
But she talks a lot. And before this night is over, all Venice will know it. And tomorrow it will be Grand Canal gossip! ... Oh!
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
No, don't go away!
I should have phoned... but I wanted to see you... be with you...
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What are you doing here?
My son is sick, okay?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Oh, of course I remember that!  But then I must have had a dizzy spell, and fainted!
You might have killed him!
You are, Holly.  Stop it.
Right.
BIANCA
He just wants me to be someone I'm not.
Oh, so now you think you know me?
My father wouldn't approve of that that
Thanks.  So... do we talk about this... or what?
Thanks, Stan.
You made me have an abortion.
Nice surprise.
I'm sorry... I don't know what to say.
You're still jealous.
You and your touchy investors.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
I had the dream. The dream came back again...
What?--
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ten years ago? Let's see...  ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
OK.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
What are you doing here?
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Up the trail.
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that.  No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
Good evening, Louis. You seem to be very crowded tonight. Can you manage a table near the floor?
Count d'Algout...
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
I'll think about it.  I'm okay.
I have to go back now.
I'm scared.
I have to go back.
That took guts.
You're not.
He wouldn't use around me.  I don't like any of it.
Sam took them to a movie.
He's not gay.  I found out purely by accident, believe me.
That would be the reason.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school...
When will you be going?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
This is your place.
You're late!
No.
This is where we're going!
... Mike.
I don't know.
He's a great poet.
Like her paint job?
Tonight we open new doors.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Jacques, you set a world record.
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
Of course, medical! _ 42.
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't care.  As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
No.  No.  Mom wants you to come to the funeral.  It's on Friday.
My dad liked you.  And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know.  I don't really understand it.  I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on.  It's like...  He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
What are you doing out here?
The English??
Doesn't suit you.
Just answer.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
You mean like pedal pushers?
What'd you say to her?
Oh, baby. What a bad boy you are!
Sorry, baby... When's the first time you done it with a girl who wasn't hookin'?
Is everything all right?
You weren't in the state legislature.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Kind of reminds me of that thing you did back in the state legislature.
That's all right, that's all right...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified?  Were you alone?
What about medical?
I feel like I'm spying on Rick.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Really.
This is not relaxing.
You're on vacation, remember?  You're supposed to be relaxing.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
He looks better with that stuff out of his hair.  He's an attractive man.
Where?
Not that he doesn't deserve to get fired... Look!  Cory's going for second!... Sneaky!
Maybe.
Talk to them!  Heavens!
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Hair stuff?
I don't know what to do.
Yes.  And so terribly annoying when they cry.  I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Let's not get carried away.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Daddy??!?!?!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Where's Daddy?
I know. I don't understand it either.
You know what I mean.
You finish the reading for E-con?
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up with that?
Hey, don't take it personal.  And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other.  We're teammates, okay?
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
She hates all freshmen.
Why?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
I guess so.
Do I detect a note of jealousy?
Then maybe you should get your glasses checked.
When was the last time you heard me sneeze?
Apollo?
Don't you?
My relationship with God is my own.
I would think so.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Your dead friend Jack?
Are you better now?
You're to be discharged tomorrow. Will you be all right?
Yep.  How was your trip...?  Help me clean up, okay?
Why?  Because I remind you of someone?  That's not very complimentary.  And nothing would... happen...
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
And...?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
That's sick!
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
I'm cold.
I have to go, Julian.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
You told her?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Joel, you're a liar.
More?
Really?  Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
You saw all that in one glimpse?
Now, darling, soak in your beautiful pine bath and let Gaston shave you.
You shouldn't have let her do that! If he ever --
Thank heaven that's over!
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Fuckin' A --
You think so?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I need a shower.
We have to meet.
One hour.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Stage fighting!  Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Two million dollars?
What is that?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I wasn't gonna --
Okay. See you around.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
Can I pour you one?
Frankie kept them in the same apartment: it cut his travel-time.
Listen, Raymond, a year ago, DEA had this guy Glenn Michaels on possession with intent but couldn't make it stick. In his statement, Glenn said he went up to Detroit to visit a friend and look into job opportunities -- if you can believe that.
Detroit, you must be pretty busy.
I'll need a last known address.
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
Come on, Raymond, I'm a federal officer, I'm armed.
It's a question of emphasis, you might say. Accentuate the positive, so to speak.
How's the water?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I sincerely doubt it.
This is my favorite part.  Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand.  Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Well, what is this?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Oooh, but they are not. Look.
The universal language of mankind.  What music do you like, Harold?
Yeah?
Okay.
I haven't decided.
Print one line of that, and I'll blow your place up!
Hey, Rosa... it's Betty. How do you get to this town called 'Tustin?' It's in Orange County...
Tustin? Take the Hollywood Freeway to the Five...
The Five?
Just look for the really crowded road and follow that.
Better let me talk to him.
Women aren't that unpredictable.
And may I go to Mass?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Well, what do you think?
You would?
I found this.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's bad enough that you are.  It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Why did you lie to me?
This isn't a courtroom.  Don't try to turn this around on me.
I think you're making a mistake, sir.
Have lunch.
Leave four columns open on the front page tomorrow.
With pay!
Can I have a month's vacation?
Okay!  Damn!
I knew this would happen!  You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me.  Don't do it!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
No.
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Well I'm sort of involved.
I didn't <U>know</U> we were <U>going</U> to be married.
I thought it was what you wanted, Clarence.
You're a little ahead of yourself--the usual routine would be for you to propose, and if I accept, then you'd give me an engagement ring--
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Is this your new dress suit?
You're looking magnificent, Leon...  ...isn't he, General Savitzky?
From what I read I thought champagne was a strong drink. It's very delicate. Do people ever get drunk on this?
Ahem.
Who's dead?
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You're calling <u>Lydia</u> in <u>my</u> office. You must think I'm some dope.  You fuckin' bastard... You...  ... stay out all night long...
Hello!
Good. I want to talk to you.
I'll be damned if that wasn't a wrong number?
But not for me.
I thought you knew! I want to go through life laughing and beautiful and jumping into fountains naked! Good night!
Miss Daniels? Is that you?
Why?
Yes.
Hi.  Is something wrong? Is that cut beginning to bother you?
Sooner is better than later!
What happened?  Who gave the order to attack?
Were the men confessed?  Where are the priests?
Yes.
Dr. Hirsch, what's wrong? Is this more serious than I know?
And what else?
Surely you're not suggesting...
I like banks.  That's where the money is.
Bully for you.
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
Goodbye.
I paid the money.
Thank you.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Yes.
Jack.  I said the kids are asleep...
Her most famous part -- men went to bed with the dream -- and they didn't like it when they woke up with the reality -- do you feel that way with me?
But... they're odd-looking.  They're for milk.  Your mum's got them.  You must have seen a thousand of them -- what's the fuss about?
Yes!
You don't care if I die
Against anything. Just protest.
When I go?
What's the matter?  Upset that I rubbed off on her?
The part where Bianca beat the hell out of some guy.
Parts of it.
No, Daddy.
Okay, we'll split up.  You go to every romantic place you guys have, I'll go... someplace brilliant, and the first one who...
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And...  you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Jah...
What're you looking for?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Oh God.  Oh God.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
How did you know?
I s'pose his name's David Ravell.
I'm getting back with my ex-fianc. He proposed to me right around here, so I guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...
Really?
I left my husband two days ago.
No, he was a toad. Even more of a toad than Merle... I just wear the ring to keep the flies away. Rome was the best thing I ever did, because I DID IT! And I swear to you, it changed me. I've been to Rome, Italy! I sat every morning at the Cafe Sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.
No. Loma Vista.
Nice move. Cedars Sinai?
Oh. I mean, except for that.  Yep. I'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...
You're hired!
Mr Brown.
Look at my face.  It's the face of the people who did that.  My father hardly speaks English.  We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
You need a partner for this job. You'll never find one as good as me.
It was perfect.
Someone was expecting that.
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Don't, Duff.
Clay Phillips.
Stop it --
At the bus station. He said I'd be a perfect call girl. And that he knew an agency in California that, on his recommendation, would handle me. They have a very exclusive clientele: movie stars, big businessmen, total white-collar. And all the girls in the agency get a grand a night. At least five hundred. They drive Porsches, live in condos, have stockbrokers, carry beepers, you know, like Nancy Allen in "Dressed to Kill". And when I was ready he'd call 'em, give me a plane ticket, and send me on my way. He says he makes a nice finder's fee for finding them hot prospects. But no one's gonna pay a grand a night for a girl who doesn't know whether to shit or wind her watch. So what I'm doin' for Drexl now is just sorta learnin' the ropes. It seemed like a lotta fun, but I don't really like it much, till last night. You were only my third trick, but you didn't feel like a trick. Since it was a secret, I just pretended I was on a date. An, um, I guess I want a second date.
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
And I would like to see a priest.
I would like some fresh straw.
The insurance Company would be a lot happier if you slept in your bed, not the wheelchair.
What'll you do if one of them catches you?
Eyes bloodshot. Must have been staring out the window for hours.
Is he coming back here?
What tickets?
Where's Bruce?
Where's Butch?
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me.  How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Oh. So...
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me.  But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down?
In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet.
Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels.
Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership.
Unfortunately.
Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now...
My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative.
I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger.
I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait.
He thinks he is. He says his mother was Apache, but I suspect he's lying.
Hello...?
It's too late to start over.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- _ 74.
I heard.
I felt so stupid just blowing those bubbles.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
She's very beautiful.
What do you think?
Zip me up?
Where's your dad?
What are you doing here?
Where to?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
What you did changed my life.
Hope we're not intruding.
"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar."... I can't ready anymore.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Pick me up at my father's house at around seven. And don't be late this time.
Sure. Especially if you'd be a really terrific guy and bring me a cheeseburger to go --
Now, I have two rubbers.  Wear them both, it'll desensitize you.  I don't want you coming so damn early.
Come on.  I saw you on the net.  Why do you think I accepted this date? You're a sure thing!
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
You can put it anywhere.
It would feel so yummy.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
So alive.
I didn't expect you to be so...
You're not taking me seriously.
I've got something...
I love you.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell—O.
I had one just like it -- well, it was the same idea, but I had to get rid of it.
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd— get into bad company.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
In a way.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
Look, uh, I was thinking maybe we should go have dinner sometime.
That is not what I'm --
Does it bother you?
You ever think about killing another human being?
You don't have to kill it.
You're horrible
What is he saying?  Come on, what did he say?
Sounds perfectly clear.  Where does the Ostrich come in?
Say -- "What do you want from me, Catherine?"
What if I call you Nicky?
Cheers.  My friends call me Catherine.
I know, Nicky, but I like it.
Bitch mostly, but he meant it affectionately.  You don't have any coke, do you?  I love coke and Jack Daniel's.
It's not the same thing, is it?
What?
I don't know either.
Benjamin?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Say, this is Snugsville.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
I'm rash and I'm stupid and what am I doing with you?
That's great, Woogie, I'm happy you're better -- you seem... good --but... you put me through quite an ordeal, you know.
I shouldn't have done that.  I shouldn't have done that.
Are you?
No, that's fine.  She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Oh. Hi.  Sorry.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Frank said ---
I see.
Oh.
I wouldn't know.
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Three fifteen.
You have Corey and DC.  I have my dad.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Sociologist.  And because.  Pawn shops are just like prostitutes, farm auctions and coal miners.  They're all for sale, but none of 'em would be if they weren't desperate for the money.
Then maybe you can read mine.
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Yeah.  What?
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Mickey, you're off the hook.  You should be celebrating.
You're just realizing this now?
Can I -- go out?
Philadelphia.  Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
What can I do for you?
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I am not a child.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
No.  I'm just depressed.
Sometimes I wonder if the guys we're supposed to want to go out with are the ones we actually want to go out with, you know?
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go.  Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Combination.  I don't know -- I thought he'd be different.  More of a gentleman...
He practically proposed when he found out we had the same dermatologist. I mean. Dr. Bonchowski is great an all, but he's not exactly relevant party conversation.
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
I love that dream.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
But he saw you, right?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
He said hello.
Go to the bathroom.
You're not from Alaska!  Where'd you learn to dance like that?!  And there are no starving people, are there?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you.  Trust.
Very persuasive.
Don't sulk.  What brought all this on?
No.  Probably not.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No.  I don't think so.  I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
All right.  Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
That's Ed.
Oh yes, I think it'd be a swell night to go for a walk. A nice long one.
There's nothing else here.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished.  Peter, what time were you born?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Not exactly.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
What do you want to talk about instead? <u>Your</u> day?  That's a fascinating subject.
No, don't ask me!
I'm really afraid.
But I do. I will. You’re my sister.
No!... No!
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Hair?
Will it change my life?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
It doesn't matter to them.
Oh, please.  I asked you because I thought you might actually be worth going with.  But you are just a jock. No wait.  You're a jerk.
I saw you making fun of me with your lacrosse buddies.
Give me a break, you're so full of it.
If you don't want to answer, you needn't. But if you do, you must tell me the truth.
Leon, you know the jokes you told me a few days ago? I wake up in the middle of the night and laugh at them. Now, Leon that's wrong. I know they're not funny, they're silly. They're stupid. And still... I laugh... and when I look at Buljanoff and Iranoff and Kopalski I know they are scoundrels and I should hate them -- then I realize who made them like that, and instead of sending my report to Moscow I tear it up and go down and buy a ridiculous hat... and if this keeps on... am I too talkative?
Leon, I would like to ask you something.
Leon, I want to tell you something which I thought I never would say, which I thought nobody ever should say, because I thought it didn't exist... and, Leon... I can't say it...
No three-way stretch? How very un- chic.
Ebby Calvin Nuke LaLoosh--don't think too much.
Neither will I.
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Prove it.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
Oh--hello!  I got the flowers. That was sweet of you--thank you.
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics.  That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you?  Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
I have to be home in twenty minutes.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
I don't get you.  You act like you're too good for any of this, and then you go totally apeshit when you get here.
You're welcome.
What?
Oh, yeah?
You mean the one who --
What?
Oh my God --
My little Volga boatman! Stop threatening! I don't deserve this.  Are you my little Volga boatman?
Imagine two million clerks and shop girls peeking into my life for a sou! Think of my lovely life being wrapped around cheese and blood sausages! I can see a big grease spot in the midst of my most intimate moments!
Was it for this that I refused to endorse Dr. Bertrand's Mouthwash? I could have made a little fortune by saying that the Vincent Vacuum Cleaner was the only vacuum cleaner ever used by the Romanoffs... and now you want them to smear my life's secrets over the front page of a tabloid?
Oh, Leon!
First tell me, are you my little Volga boatman?
What?  We both have cars.
Yeah but, no offense, you're talking about a post-high school, long- distance relationship, and you and Kevin haven't even done it yet.
Vanderbilt's not that far from U of M.
Yeah right.
Andy, stop! I think he can help you -
Andy!
Claude, it's Andy, he's acting really weird, I think something happened last night...
Old fool!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
How was your plane ride?
Portchnik.
What's happening to us?
You said he was dead.
Oh, Rob.  What do you want me to say?
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
So, how are you?
So how would you put it?
Why did you betray me?  Paris was ours for the taking!  All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Who cares? Who cares?
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
What time are you gonna be there?
What should I do?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.
I don't know.  Few days.  Thanks for helping me.  I appreciate it.
And I miss you.
Hunh-uh.  Not yet.  Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay?  Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
Yeah, it's a real problem for me, Sailor, you know? When I went in that drugstore by the restaurant in Biloxi? I saw 'em by the register and the girl throw 'em in. I'm not big on resistin'. So what about a leech?
Say what? Honestly, sugar, you can talk more shit sometimes?
M-i-ss-i-ss-i-pp-i... You can almost hear that jazz blowin' up from the big N.O.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
What if he doesn't like me?
Everything!  Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
No.
Well...
Hmm?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
See?  You're laughing again.  But That's what I want.  Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun.  Forever.  That's my idea Of heaven.  Need someone to share It with, though.
Jane, yes.  Tom?  Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Drink?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you drink?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
I don't know.
I don't know --
But you spoke to him on the phone.
He'd call every once in a while.
Why not?
I don't know.  He was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years.  Said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.
You didn't visit him in prison.
He didn't want me to.
You mean, did he try to jump me?  No, but he was kind of talkative.
He gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.
He didn't hurt you or anything, did he?
I never said he was my dearest love. And yes, he will save me. That I know.
He knows I do not love him.
I just think you're wrong, is all.
Probably am.  Forget I brought it up.
So?
What?
What?
HEY YOU!!!!  I'm gonna get you!!!  I'll get you!!!!
You don't have a brain tumor.  He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY  No, naturally  they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
She's got to identify him.
Honey.  You got him.
I'd identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals.  I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
Hey --
He was about to un-stick me!  I paid you to help me get closure.
What are you serving?
An omelet.
Good evening, Ninotchka.
Aren't you late?
No, the opera starts an hour later tonight on account of the parade.
They didn't let me. I am in disgrace. Last week at the performance of Carmen I played a sour note. The conductor got so excited he yelled, "There's sabotage in the string section!"
Too bad... you missed an inspiring day, Anna.
I know... my heart is sad... but my feet are happy. When all the tanks and guns were roaring over the Red Square I sat here all by myself and played a Beethoven sonata. Not bad at all.  Are you expecting someone?
A few friends... just a little dinner party.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
Diet coke.
Can I have some chips?
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
Guest?
I don't know how I can get you out of it this time. How will it end? What will happen to you?
And sweet?
What shape I take matters not.  Long you for another?  I'll give you your heart's desire.
A faerie's love makes anything possible.
You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Fix it up.  It'll make you feel better.
Ray.  I hate Ian.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way.  And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too.  Then I'll be with him forever.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day.  Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
It would not be the same without you.
I was devastated. Of course.
Yes. I understand. A lot of people enjoy being dead. But they are not dead really. They're just backing away from life.  They're players - but they sit on the bench. The game goes on before them. At any moment they can join in.  Reach out! Take a chance! Get hurt maybe. But play as well as you can.  Go team, go! Give me an "L." Give me an "I."  Give me a "V." Give me an "E." LIVE!!!!!  Otherwise you'll have nothing to talk about in the locker room.
I like you, Harold.  Come, I'll teach you to waltz.
Ahm -- well -- we would have liked to -- but it was difficult, obviously, being set in space.
I can't be.
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew.  Do I mind? Why do I mind?  I do mind.  What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him.  I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
What happened?
I'll see you tomorrow.
What is?
He tore his ACL.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Not great.
What?
Ooooh!
There's nothing to it.
Well I never did it.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
You've got big feet.
Yes -- happiness wouldn't be happiness without a violin-playing goat.
I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.
Wanna go to dinner?
Hi.  What are you doing?
What were you like when you were younger?
But you don't mind.
Why do you say that?
I bet you could do a book.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
He certainly could. About a month.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
We don't want to go there.
Maybe I better start working on him.
How many ways can a man say no.
You're not giving up?
What are you waiting for? Do something.
But you use potato?
Do you know what you've done!? Do you know?
I'll probably marry him.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I don't think so.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him.  He's Indian, he wears a turban.
With his Sergeant.  A Mr. Hardy.
You said that already.
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
I think this place is just fine.
Do it!
Yes..
We going somewhere?
Maybe I should drive this time.
I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
No, never before. I've fallen into lakes, out of rowboats, when I was a little girl. And I fell into a river, once, trying to leap from one stone to another. But I've never fallen into San Francisco Bay. Have you? Ever before?
You let me make a fool of myself! You lied to me! I don’t know why that surprises me because lying is what you do. It’s your job. It’s who you are. How would you even know if something were real?
You’re right. I was so desperate to make everyone believe I was happy that I spent six grand on a lie. And after all that? The only one who ended up falling for it was me.
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there.  The Milton Gregory School.
You live in Manhattan?
Are you nervous?
And I appreciate you, too.
You’ve always got that to hide behind, don’t you? It’s just business!
I think so, sir.  Now then, let me see.
I understand completely, sir.
No, of course not.
Lovebirds, sir?
Well... yes, sir, there are.
So she did help you?
No, you're right.  Or Buddy.  I won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in Detroit.  Or if you've run into Glenn Michaels yet.
Take them.
I started to say... inside...
If they are?
I'm frightened, terribly frightened. I... I don't know what's out there, Mitch.
But why Egypt?
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy!  The room's alive with positive vibrations!
I kind of said that maybe they could do something.  Help.  I'm sorry.  They really wanted to come.  I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me.  I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Or wound.  Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Where's Sam?
Do you need help?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid.  It pisses me off.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
I guess not.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
You loved him.
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Is that right?
A Fender Strat. You bought this?
Yeah?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, yeah. Oh.  Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
I like you in a black tie.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
... Yes, that's fine.  Of course.  I... you know... of course... I'll just... be getting along then... nice to see you.
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for.  That is not for Samuel.
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I care!  And I care because God cares!  All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
No.
If you kill him, you kill me!
What do you suggest?
Oh, honey -- tell me we haven't' progressed to full-on hallucinations.
William - he asked me to meet him here.
Who?
Have you seen him?
Look, I'm  -- sorry -- that I questioned your motives.  I was wrong.
Okay. Wait here a second.  Do we really want to do this?
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it.  I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you.  Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be.  Please.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes?
With a bag of marshmallows.
Has he been hurt?
'Scume me.
Do you remember me?
Her master's voice!  I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
I think I'll go to bed.
Oh, so that's it...
Don't get excited, Peter. They just asked a civil question.
Well, you don't have to lose your temper!
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, I live downtown.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Oh, gee, I don't know.  Um...
Well, wait.  You know what?  I know.
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
And now I am back.
Like this. I have no robe.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman?
No comment.
Thanks.  It was my idea.
Are you kidding?  No.
Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere.  Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did.
You jump, I jump, right?
He killed a police officer.
You believe that?
Remember how talkative you were?  In the trunk?  Adele said you do that when you're nervous.
You kept touching me, feeling my thigh.
Yes, Abbe?
John Hinkley.  The guy who shot Reagan.  He only had two names.
What's in Connecticut?
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
Where are you going?
No kidding? Your own shop?
I vote for the motel.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Who cares?  Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
I want you.
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
I should tell you these do not have buttons.  See? Hooks and eyes.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
For what?
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
What have you ordered?
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Quit showing off!  We're here on business!
Couer de Noir!  A demon if the Devil ever made one.
I thought you quit.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
German.
What's it look like?
I'll think about it.
This is not good.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
How about music?  You like classical?
Well, what about books?  You like Hemingway?  You gotta love Hemingway.
You were attacked.  My God.  Should I call a doctor!  Did you call the police...
You're all right... you sure...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets.  None.  And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me.  Just tell me the truth.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
What's the matter, chérie?
The stamp market, of course -- it is here every Thursday afternoon. This is where Jean-Louis trades his --
He was so excited -- when he got the stamps you gave him this morning. He said he had never seen any like them.
Yeah, it's this box, it has pictures, sound.  You don't have to use your brain at all.
Know what we're gonna do in a little while then?  We're gonna call Domino's and have'm deliver a bigass pizza.  We're gonna eat it in bed.  We're gonna veg' out and watch television.
Uh-uh.  No work.
I wasn't as much fun as I thought it was going to be.
Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one.
Nick!  Nick!  Are you asleep?
No.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
But I don't know love... I'm like a machine programmed to save other people's lives but never to have one of my own.
I have thousands of memories but none of them are mine... There is no need for me other than this. I'm immortal but I have no life.
Why?... Why would you need me?
Goodnight.
What good will they do?
He must have. He sent for the Santa Rosa police.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Where's Mitch?
Oh, thank you.
Why? Didn't Al believe my story?
Al Malone wanted him out at the Fawcett farm.
Then he saw.
He was calling from the farm, Mrs. Brenner.
I'm...all right.
Everything's okay?
Yes?
No?
You seem tense.  Is everything all right?  You feel okay?
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
About a job.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
Do you have music up there?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I don't know.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Who is it?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
It's so cold.
You just did.
I know.  Hey, don't mind me.  I'm being stupid.  I'll think about it, okay?  It's a real good offer for a whore.
Fine.
Pat's an architect, too.
Oh, Westley, darling.  Westley, why won't you hold me?
What could I be?
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
Here.
It's Saturday.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Yeah?
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake?  Stop whining and do something about it.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified.  So get qualified.  You can insist on being better prepared.  You don't have to just leave it as...  'I don't write.  I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
Oh, hello darling.
This is for you , Mac. The names of all the headwaiters in town. You can always buy a bit of choice scandal from them at reasonable prices.
Hello . . .
You're saying this only to make me go.
No.
But what about us?
Do you want to?
Yes.
Only when they make interesting reading.
Why would I need an attorney?
Do you have a cigarette?
He sucks soup through his front teeth.
... cigars in bed? I broke him on that.  But the bathroom's a swamp, he wears Reeboks to dinner, tells the same, admittedly funny, jokes three hundred times...
How about...
What shall we do?
Every ship but your four fastest, you mean.
I've been following this guy for years. I'm your best shot.
I'd need an introduction. From someone he trusts. Someone who owes us a favor.
We've got to catch him in the act.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Burma!
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you sure?
What do I think? You mean about the possibility of your becoming a monster in two days or about visits from dead friends?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Oh stop.  Things will change.  My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody.  Stop.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Cheers.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
You shouldn't.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
Well, mama was at the Busy Bee havin' her hair dyed? And I was alone in the house.
Uncle Pooch came in the side door through the porch, you know? Where I was makin' a jelly and banana sandwich? I remember I had my hair in curlers cause I was goin' that night with Vicki and Cherry Ann, the DeSoto sisters. Uncle Pooch must have known nobody but me was home, cause he came right in and put both his hands on my butt and sorta shoved me up against the counter.
No, he picked me up.
He was short but powerful. With hairy arms? Anyway, he carried me into the maid's dayroom which nobody used. We did it there on an old bed.
Well, sure. But he was super-gentle, you know? I mean, he raped me and all, but I guess there's all different kinds of rapes. I didn't exactly want him to do it but I suppose once it started, it didn't seem all that terrible. It was over pretty quick, and after Uncle Pooch just stood there and pulled up his trousers and left me there. I stayed in bed till I heard him drive off. Then I just went back into the kitchen and finished makin' my sandwich.
I have one now.
Where's your coat and hat?
Don't mind Mother.
I dunno... you have that sharp, useless look.
What happened to us, exactly?
Why did you say those things?
Hello.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
I promise.
Where do I charter a boat?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
No.  He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Actually, I was married.  For four years.  But... well, we didn't fit together.  I'm divorced now.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman.  And we were on the debate team together.  But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much.  And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Sorry.  You don't know how many times I've heard that.  "A lady lawyer?  Are you crazy?"  Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man.  Or better, in fact.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
U-huh.
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
Take me away...
Oh, yes.
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Can you love a player?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
...Yes --
M'hm.
A loser?
You can read it, if you want to.  You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
Why?
Jack.
If I was taking calls full time would I be living in this kip? I'd be back on Park Avenue; I could support the whole National Guard!
No.  I mean yes, I'm not.  I decided to call it off.  Well, actually, it was kind of mutual.
Yes.  I am.
Oh!  You mean Gay Old Bohemian Days of Gay Old San Francisco!  The juicy stories? Like who shot who in the Embarcadero August, 1879?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
She fell down.
Yes.  I hated her for coming between my mother and father.  She kept me from seeing my father.  I went down there to ask her where he was.  She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
Who?
You're a fool!
Not with strangers.
How do you know you can touch that plug? Are you a licensed contractor?
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
Thank you.
You're moving away?  When?
That's little egotistical.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
Oh Jesus...
Are you crazy? Why would I pick you? You're a murderer.
You mean he's not a criminal?
I married into it.
Oh, God!
But...
... unless he has a hump.
No. But one assumes obligations. My wife's family is all gone; someone has to look after her interest. Her father's partner runs the company yard in the East -- Baltimore -- so I decided as long as I had to work at it, I'd come back here. I've always liked it here.
Oh, wow!
That is so romantic.
Who was that?
What did he want?
Well, from now on the play will be easy. All you have to do is bring the wife back, have her say she's sorry, and then your play's over.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Phil for God sake.
Excuse me?
I came to see you. How you feel?
Honey, a couple of years ago, with Jane and Frankie? -- Jane sent me a Dumper --
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend.  So, I've been seeing this guy...
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow.
Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration.
The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again.  By about five minutes.
I wonder.
I want to.  For food, got it? Eat something before the wind blows you away.
No.  You took care of rent, that's enough.
How did he look?
Right.
... Especially the sneakers.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
What?
Amen
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet.  Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
You don't have to explain.
Plus, you could use that commission.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah, what happened there.
Oh good.
It's true.  Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code.  It wasn't easy but I figured it out.  It spelled your name.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
One night with me!
Believe it.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Not if you're over sixteen.
...See you tomorrow night.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever… you and Lieutenant Singh…
Kip's another one.
Hello.
You saved my life.  I haven't forgotten.  I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Olive told me.  You might have told me yourself.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
Very much. Now, where were we?
Certainly.
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
I don't know.  I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
I'm going to marry Walter.  I just have to get this out of my system.
No, he's nothing like me.  He's like you.  Only straight.
He's the salt of the earth.  Kind and loyal and generous.  The one constant thing in my life, is he'll always be there.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Oh, I'll call you up some time. And if your social duties permit - why -
Oh no, you won't, Mr. Smith. You're a married man now. Mother always warned me never to run around with married men.
My error.
Well, that's that.  Stay there, Nick!
What is it about men and nudity? Particularly breasts -- how can you be so interested in them?
No seriously.  I mean, they're just breasts.  Every second person in the world has got them...
That's Jellybean!
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
It was inspirational.
In the room?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Don't be silly. How bad?
I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead.
How long have they been gathering there?
I keep thinking of Annie.
If that was the R, I'd love to see the X.
They're birds!
Really?
Sure. Have a good night.
What are you reading?
Somerset Maugham.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
It doesn't make a difference!  I have to move out!
What's the difference?!  It's just somebody I met!
Yeah.
I'll never forget you said it.
What are you thinking?
Listen, he's nuts. I mean certifiable. But believe it or not, he once looked great in Levis. That's why my mother married him. But like all good things...  I know what you're thinking.
See ya, Bandit.
But Buljanoff, Iranoff, Kopalski...
I will do my best.
How can I make myself clear... It is difficult to express but I'd rather not go to foreign countries any more. Please, Comrade... let me stay here... let me finish my work... I am in the rhythm of it now... I don't want to go away. I don't want to be sent into that foreign atmosphere again. It throws one out of gear.... Let me finish my work... I have concentrated everything in it... Please... don't make me go.
I am sorry, I don't want to overstep my position -- but please... don't send me.
No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
You're not...
I-
Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
Ted.  I don't know why you got on this flight.  I don't know what you're trying to prove.
He hates me.
He hates me.
I don't think.  I know.  He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world.  He doesn't like my friends--he--
Harold, everyone has the right to make an ass out of themselves. You just can't let the world judge you too much.
Well, why don't you?
With Life.
Pray? No.  I communicate.
Spreckled with uncountable stars. The stars are shining right now. We just can't see them. Just another instance of all that's going on that is beyond human perception.
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
Yes, it made me cry  it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Is that what you think?  Is that what you think I think?
Do you have to wear that hat?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
I haven't changed my mind, Westley, I want you to understand that! I don't like you! I never have!  I never will! That's clear enough, isn't it?
You've got a good thing and you're hanging on to it, huh?  All right, You win. I'll just have to get used to you. I admit I'm licked. But only because I'm worried. I've had detectives all over the country searching for her. I've seen thousands of photographs. Fortune tellers, nuts, every crank in the country has written me.  Haven't slept one night this week. If I don't find her, I'll go crazy.
Yes. I know. Well, you can help now. I issued a statement yesterday that I've withdrawn my objections. Begging her to come home. I haven't heard from her. Apparently she doesn't trust me.
All right. That's why I sent for you.  There's a room full of reporters out there. I want you to make a statement—that you've had a talk with me—that we've reached an understanding—that if Ellen comes home, I won't interfere with your marriage. Will you do that?
Of course I mean it! I don't care whom she's married to—  —as long as I can get her back.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North.  Are we getting hot?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska.  The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich.  I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Dr. Paulsen?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
Oh, it's only a machine, Harold. It's not as if it were <u>alive</u>, like a horse or a camel. We may live in a machine age, but I simply can't treat them as equals.  Of course, the age has its advantages.
Oh. My. God. I can't believe you're here. Welcome. Can I just tell you, I am so excited right now.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Sounds like you may be on to something.
Well, whatever you think.
I like a place with lots of life.
Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go?
Yes.
Then go.
Is anyone there?
Look.
Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark.
I really shouldn't have any more. I'm a little tipsy already.
Someone get a doctor.
Yeah.  I'm so glad we did this.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them.  So I chose my dad.  It just felt safer that way, you know?
One game.  One-on-one.
Do you live here in the hotel?
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I have to be somewhere.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I don't know.  I may be in love with him.
I don't know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Yeah?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again!  I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the...  -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
...what...?
Yeah.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I think you're a louse.
You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately...
What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical...
What are you? A policeman?
I didn't break that window!
I'm not accusing.  I'm asking.  Do you...do you find me too...too giving?  Too-too-too competent?  Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Well, what is it then?  What?  Eh, what's come between us?  How have I alienated you?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded.
So?  Is that what you said to her?
Did we want to?
Do they have a secret handshake?
What is it with you and the space program?
Nothing scary there.  Sorry.
That's it?
Of course I know --
... when my mom went into labor, my dad panicked. He never had a kid before, and crashed the car. Now, picture this: their car's demolished, crowd is starting to gather, my mom is yelling, going into contractions, and my dad, who was losing it before, is now completely screaming yellow zonkers. Then, out of nowhere, as if from thin air, this big giant bus appears, and the bus-driver says, "Get her in here.". He forgot all about his route and just drove straight to the hospital. So, because he was such a nice guy, they wanted to name the baby after him, as a sign of gratitude. Well, his name was Waldo, and no matter how grateful they were, even if I'da been a boy, they would't call me Waldo. So they asked Waldo where he was from. And, so there you go.
I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.
Can you at least start wearing a bra?
And why would I do that?
What?
Did you say something?
Rob.  Don't be childish.
Great, Mom.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Oh, all that work.
Thank you.
Nicky? Oh my God. Stay right there.
What?
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.  Wait.  Use the frosted glasses.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Yes.
Call and tell you.
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
No. Are you drunk?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
So am I.
That's why I was getting a divorce..  What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I don't know.
You don't seem very sure.
Yes.  But it wasn't really.  It was just...
What're you doing?
I know I'm limping.  I stubbed my toe.
If it's any of your business, yes.
NO.
Yes.
Are you drunk?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Did he give any reason?
Ask me?
-- Yes?
Where's pop?
Well, let's spit on it.
What? He's in Sicily!
As you like.
Well, good.  Good for you.
Nothing.  So good luck.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Child, take a bite.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
How can you tell it's a female?
Shhhh.  Just stay with me.  Stay with me.  Everything is forgiven. Everything.
You are.  You're losing your mind.  What about Walter?
I have vacation time coming to me.
...The rain falls...
What did he say exactly? I mean, you don’t think he wants me back?
Of course he is. I’m here with my new man.  I love it! Your magic’s already working. Let the suffering begin.
King—King Westley was in it.
Thanks, professor.
I'd change places with a plumber's daughter any day.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Good, Jack.  Maybe we’ll keep her.
Huh! And they say charity’s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah...  Christ...
That’s right. Where’s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
<u>Adolph</u>?
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Really?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Do you like it?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Dance then?
I'd given you up.
I'll have the same.
Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine.
Not quite as bad as the weather though... It must be a hundred and ten and it ain't even noon yet.
No radio or TV...
And no AC.
Now what?
Sailor?
Do we have a gun in the car?
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
Oh, no. But I should have liked to have been an astronaut. A private astronaut able to just go out and explore. Like the men who sailed with Magellan, I want to see if we really can fall off the edge of the world.  What a joke it will be if like them I -
- end where I began.
Yes.
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
How could you do this to me?
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Fair.
Who's the guy, who's the wife?
You haven't told me everything.
I just want a salad.  You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it.  What's to eat?
Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm.
She admits it's her fault.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
No... In the brains... What little I'm sure he has.
In the head.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
Neat, yeah.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
M'hm...
Oh, yeah.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
You're telling me.
... and public relations is a big problem area for him.
I asked my doctor. He said only another emotional shock could do it, and probably wouldn't. And you're not going to go diving off another rooftop to find out.
I have to go.
What.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
oh.
Sure.  I'm fine.  I don't know why I never did this before.  I mean, what's the big deal?
The book said they have boats that are like taxis...  Vaporettos.  What's the name of the place we're staying again?
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd."  I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter.  Something.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Elbows, Son.
Let's eat our cake.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
Yes...
Make the one you want.
Yes.
Don't laugh. -- I could do it!
For yourself -- and me.  I could get you a dozen assignments tomorrow... fashion, portraits --
I could see you looking handsome and successful in a dark blue flannel suit.
What's the matter, hon?
It had better be good.
The add just said &quot;Makeup Artist&quot;
I know why you broke up with me in college.  And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too.  So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
Stiffs??
Yes it is.
I can tell.
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait.  I just have to get my shoes.
Well!
and there she was lying dead.  The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Yeah.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Why, you said...
I said 'excited'.  Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
Oh, I know.  So, who're these clients?
Yeah, I guess there's nothing like watching those tenpins fall, huh, Del?
Not a thing.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Twenty-seven.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy.  You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one.
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
What are they?
I don't know.  I can't be alone.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
"Thrills"?  That's what you're waiting for?  You know how long that lasts?  Besides, how do you know?  Have you ever been out with him?
No.  He's never asked me.
You don't have any idea?
He's a podiatrist or something.
What's he do?
I don't know, Kate.
Why don't you ask him?
Why should I ask someone out who I don't want to go out with in the first place?
Maybe that would be a good idea.
Please.  When I came here it was for a little adventure--a little game which you play tonight and forget tomorrow. But something has changed me--and it isn't the champagne.  The whole thing is new to me. Very new. I've got a confession to make to you.  Baron, you are a crook.  You robbed the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine.  May I have the salt?
Hah, some guys say I have magic fingers.
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
He said that, too.
Don't you have to be somewh...
... just my bridal shower.  And Michael has to meet our dads and the groomsmen at Comiskey for a one-thirty game.
Decency?  Hey listen, pal ...
Turn it up, Magda.
What's with you? You know what take care of him means. I don't call Santos except for one big reason.
I want you to get rid of Sailor.
Yes... Get rid of him.
Santos, why in hell do you insist on playin' this stupid game?
I don't need to explain anymore'n I have... You know damn well.
I'm sorry you read it.
He looks wonderful, Jackson...
No...
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
Hey, you!
But, you're in love with someone who doesn't exist. You come here, you meet this guy, who should laugh in your face, and instead you leave with him!  Betty, you are one-of-a-kind...
No, I'm not sure I could begin to imagine... So, where'd you go?
To a party in the Hollywood Hills.
I have, lots of times. My mother used to clean them. I used to piss in their pools.
Was it a huge place? With a view of the whole world?
Yes. I'd never been in a place like that before.
A wife knows.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
No speech?
Where do you want to go?
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
I am you, you little bastard.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
This part is dream, I think. There is a tower and a bell and... a garden below... but it seems to be in Spain... a village in Spain. And then it clicks off, and is gone.
That might have been good enough in Rome last summer. But it's not good enough now.
Here's a nice place.
You said I was a lady in distress.
You know, you said something to me when you first met me that I've thought about a great deal.
What did you mean by that?
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
Yeah?
Oh, no.
He was trying to tell me something.
No. He knows no one in London, besides me. I shouldn't have left him alone.
Why did you?
'Been up north?
Beer okay?
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
You're sure?  There was nothing?
Yeah.
I actually had it in my apartment in New York and just thought you'd... but, when it came to it, I didn't know how to call you... having behaved so... badly, twice.  So it's been just sitting in the hotel.  But then... you came, so I figured... the thing is... the thing is ...
I just had the unpleasant sensation of hearing you referred to as my husband.
Kiss me.  Before I cut.  Just in case.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over.  Give me the pliers.
I'm not scared.  So many people have died around me.  But I would be a shame for us.  I don't feel like being shy.
I don't know.
Dreyfuss.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
I mean. I want to...
want to talk to you about something very important.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
Telling him is the long shot - I'm going to take it.
He'll probably kick me right down the stairs. I only hope he does.
I'm having lunch with him today. He expects an answer. It's going to be pretty.
I'm going to tell him the truth.
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
But Wynant --- ?
Will - uh - five thousand be enough?
I don't know how to thank you. Mother'll be so grateful - she'll probably want to kiss you.
For the letters, of course.
You're a peculiar person. Why the other day I pleaded with you not to send in that story and —
Yeah.
Do I love you?
Come on.  Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah...  yeah. Do you love me?
Oh--no, no!
What other girl—?
But that's ridiculous! You can't make a sudden change like that.
No.
Well do you think it was him?
Rex. Get away from the door.
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Is he there?
You're leaving?
... Nothing.
Well, if he continues to maintain this position -- we're in court.
Shit.
Anyway, even Rex seemed perplexed by his intransigence. If I didn't know better, I'd swear Massey had some personal investment in my ruination.
So where are you now?
Of course.
Get this! He called and invited me to dinner.
There's no mistake, Bill.   If you veto their funding, it's not a mistake. If you hurt someone intentionally, it's not a mistake.
God, Sailor... That's the night my daddy died.
Everything all right.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
That's some big secret you been carryin', Sailor.
Actually, it's none of my business.
Did you drive up from San Francisco?
No. Just a few hours.
Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time.  There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay.  Did you plan on staying long?
Well... something like that.  I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
You're leaving after you see Cathy?
It's a nice drive.  Is that where you met Mitch?
Yes.
Yeah, I mind.  You bet your ass I mind.
What do you mean? What did I do to you...
I SAID FORGET IT!
All right, everybody! That's ten minutes!
Is there a problem, George?
Tell me all the details.
Kind of.
You didn't?
Hi.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
Ciao.
But how could he know?  He only just met me.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Well, I don't understand.  What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Feeling old?
I've covered everything. And you're the best, so--
Look, there's a video security system to bypass, that's the only hard part. You've done that a dozen times.
You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese.
Not eight...
Eight is good... "V" could be Victory.
Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate.
It's hurting.
Rafe... No.  You forgive me.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe.  It wasn't a choice.  It --
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people?  Do I, do I put people off?
Oh?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something.  You think I'm too self-sufficient?
I'm fine.
You know what they say about men with big feet?
Don't turn around now - but there's a very beautiful girl up there who seems to be staring at us.
You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
This girl is a friend of yours?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Now that's true!
You got me all confused.
Who lives?
Magda? She's not my grandmother -- actually she rents the apartment right next to mine. Her husband passed away a couple years ago so she doesn't like to be alone.
Sadly, no. Well except for the lint.
Yeah, I think it's that dog of hers running around on the rug all day -- just makes for a lot of lint. Look at this...
Over there.  Ten o'clock.  He's talking to our little Dennis.  Dennis will turn into one of those "sources say" things.
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling?
There he is.  Snoop Doggy-Dogg.
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me.
Lester's on his way.
Are you in love with someone else?
I didn't know Barry had a beach house.
You want to come out to the beach house tomorrow?
Nice meeting you, Cledus. Keep on truckin'.
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Only if you can afford it.
Yes.
Thanks.  I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
No, Cole, I...
Cole, we've got to talk.
Gay?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Girlfriend?
How long have you been standing there?
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
No!
I'm not sewing anything else.
George, I don't --
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Hey.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
It just isn't.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Annabelle Daniels.  714-454-9346.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
That's all you got, lady.  Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Nervous?
Simon, I'm going to check ROK's secondary readout unit.
Go ahead.
That's okay, ROK.
Oh, la...
Be it fit for your wife, Green Jack?
Let it.  Haven't you a cozy bower we might hide in?
Then, perchance you'll me.
Jack.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
I was, because if you said "yes" right away, I wouldn't get to say this next part.  And I've been practicing it.  Ready?
"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee  that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me".
I borrowed it from this guy I know. So?
You never said anything to me...
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year.  They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Did you think it was so special?
I knew you'd like him.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months.  And yes, I'll admit it.  I've still kind of got a thing for him.  That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
What?!
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
You kill people.
Because you think I'm all like... "Hey man, check me out".
I'm going to kill myself.
No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things.
I'm being a pain in the ass.  It's beautiful here.
Thanks for helping with the bag.  It looks great!
I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one.
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
I just want some fresh air.
Would you mind opening the window?
Who'd care?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
I know God help me, I know that, Eli.  But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
It's not a joke.
Oh don't be silly.  Death is nothing to be scared of.  It's just another way of living.  It's just a fresh start--kinda like spring training.
It's all the same thing.
Much better.  Your delivery was fully integrated because you weren't thinking about it 'cause you were pissed off at me.  This is progress.
Yeah, same here.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
You got kids?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off.  Big mistake, huh?
You have a disease.
Shhh...
Thanks a lot.
I don't know where to go.  The hotel is surrounded.
Good afternoon--
You called this morning?
Hey.  It's Liz.
I’m really sorry you were not called...
Mr Lombard...
Two days.
Not at all.
Hey, Ross.  Tell me something.  Does PG&E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
The fuck you don't.  No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you.  People are dying, Ross.  You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it.  I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
What are you dressed up for?  Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
I don't want your money!
Mademoiselle Gautier--or whatever your name is--I thank you for your advice, but I must ask you to go. You've got your money--
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Hey. What are you doing?
You're so scared.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her.  I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Oh, but making up the facts as you go along is ethical?  Actually, I meant you.  You probably got severance or expenses or both.  I'll take your check. No credit cards.
Because I think you're writing on spec and with a first person interview, you might actually sell that thing.
Seven-fifty.
I look like some hoochie to you?  I found it on your floor.
Didn't know you cared so much.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight.  Quarks and dark matter, things like that.  Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Bad?
I must really be slacking off.  Hungry?
Sushi.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Get down!  The ritual chant! Quick!  Protect yourself!
Will you read it for me?
Sure.
Jessica, can you drive me home?
He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either.
U-huh.
He sold the feed to me, didn't he?
There's nothing wrong with those chickens, Mitch. I'm going to call Fred Brinkmeyer right now.
Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup.
Whose side are you on?
Well, I think it's very simple.  Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism.  I'll be at the Public Library.  Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
What if i go out on tricks - you wanna come along? You could sit and read the National Geographic.
I am?
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
I shall call you Mr. Ferguson.
That's a good occupation. And live here... alone?
I prefer John. There, that's done.  And what do you do, John?
One shouldn't live alone.
I don't get you.
You might get me an accurate map of Paris. I want to use my spare time to inspect the public utilities and make a study of all outstanding technical achievements in the city.
You, Comrade Iranoff, go to the Public Library and get me the section of the Civil Code on property.
We cannot feed the Russian people on your intentions. Fifty per cent to a so-called Duchess!... Half of every loaf of bread to our enemy! Comrade Kopalski, go at once to our Embassy and get the address of the best lawyer in Paris.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What are they for?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone.  Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I...  ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
About three years.
No, darling, lip rouge--all over your mouth.
I like touching you--poison ivy.  You'd just been kissing that girl when I came in, hadn't you?
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
He was creepy.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
I KNOW THAT!  I WAS DISTRACTED BY GRIEF!
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.  You fink!
Oh... no one... no one.  Just some... guy from the past.  I don't know what he's doing here.  Bit of an awkward situation.
No!  Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
Well -- well I'm just back. And -- I must tell you -- something quite wonderful.
Yeah -- being a basket case.
Yes -- it would be nice.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it?  To let go of what you want?
That seems so far away from who you are now.  What happened?
Really?
Those, over there, there.
Your brother?
What was I gonna do?  Tell him the truth?
Well... just meet her.
Yes.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
What!
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Where's the ring?
No, it's your life. But you were the bright young lawyer who decided he was going to be chief of police some day.
I think they're going to deregulate it.
I think they'll probably have booze there.
I've never seen a moon like that.
Have you.
Well.  There's a lot of memories to choose from...
That's gone long ago.  I've got to see him.  Where is he?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more.  He made a big settlement on you.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
I want to fuck.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes... yes!  And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery?  Why didn't he?
Stop, stop... I can't remember!  The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No!  I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone!  I didn't kill that man!
Yes!  We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
Does that make it right...
Okay.
Didn't he tell you what you wanted?
Yes.
You better not be fucking teasing me.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
Yeah?
I think we need to eat.
I really should get home...
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Who fired you?
"Stop! Beyond this passage lie the catacombs of Paris: the exclusive domain of the dead."
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
After the revolution, the Paris cemeteries overflowed. They dug up all the old bodies and brought them here. Seven million people. Mostly very poor.
Home?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Paul Lamont...?
Yes... You woke me up... It’s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Daddy--
Good evening.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Wbat're you talking about?
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
I'm sorry.
It's not mine.
It's what you came back for.
You think so?
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Fuck off.
There must have been somebody.
Senorita Josie.
I thought you were a garbageman of humanity, or something.
I wrote that when I was twelve... where'd you get that?!
I don't feel that, no. I just... I'm not really who you think I am.
"Thirty-two?"
I'm just finishing up, too.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Yes. Very clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Hello, Rick.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Much.
Not a chance--I'm through.
Well, I suppose...
So...how's the knee?
Yes?
First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth.
Thank you.  You still think that he was....
I know.
Yes. Again.
Do you want to sleep on it?
Do you want me to sleep on it?
Yes, Miles. I accept.
Yes.
Yes, desperately.
Oh, thank you!
I'll send it to you at Glades.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home.  I quit.  Laurie, I quit.  I'm going back to Baltimore.  How does a blonde do a high- five?
I am ashamed to put the picture of Lenin in a room like this.  Comrades, your telegram was received with great disfavor in Moscow.
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Do you think I could have some water?
Ernie's?
He's allergic to everything.
Chocolate?
Shut up, Will.
I can't find him.  I've tried everything.  I thought you might know.
It was mind control.  <u>Manchurian</u> <u>Candidate</u> kind of stuff, right?
Ask what you can do for your country.  That kind of thing.
Terminal?
If I had any idea what to charge you with or how to prove it, I'd arrest you right here.
You've gotta get outta here.
It's a secret.  I can't even tell you, my dear.  I've got an important idea to work on.
Everyone's all right...?
I'm all right.
Tommy...!
So.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry!  Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
ISN'T THERE A GUARD?  A JANITOR? A FUCKING CLEANING WOMAN? I'LL TAKE A BURGLAR!  SOMEBODY'S GOTTA BE IN TH...
I'm sorry I'm late, but something happened.
About what?
Oh...  Now she's starting.  How do they know?
Where?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
Where have you been for a week?!
But you can't call me while you think?
By the way, how's he doing?
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
And did everything -- ?
That's weird. I talked to your brother Jimmy five or six times.
I can't believe he remembered you. He never remembers anybody.  You know I tried to call you for weeks after that.
A wedding.
I don't know about that.  Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky.  W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy  but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
No... it's wrong.
All right.  You won't know what to look for at first, Scottie. Even I, who know her so well, cannot tell, sometimes, when the change has begun. She looks so lovely and normal...
I just wanted to get past this &quot;old school Marm&quot; image.
what I mean?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
I know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean  oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna-  gonna sing. Yeah.
Harry?  I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Oh, I love that nose. It's such a sweet nose.
You have the cutest nose I've—
Well the other night at dinner...
I am?
Like I said, dazzling.
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
They found an eyelash.
Friend?
Sure.  In between all the other things I have to do.
Uh-oh.  That's not good.
Isn't it great to be away from it all? Aren't you happy? It seems too good to be true.
By your Austrian?
I fucked the debate team in high school.  Tsk.  I had a grampa. He liked ties on Sundays.  You mind if I take a swim in your bathtub before I hit it?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Oh.
Ted, you must remember what the doctor said, the first step on the road to sanity is admitting that you're sick.  Now take your electro-shock and you'll be back at the space center in no time.  And by the way, Ted, I'm leaving you for Simon.
If that's the way you want it.
Goodbye, Ted.  I don't want to hurt you.
Compute!
Set!
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
Great?
I'll be there--Good-by.
The Mask. Where is it?
I don't know what you consider it -- but if you don't stop it, I'm getting out of here.
Wait. I have Mr. Grocer for you.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
An on-site monitoring well?  That means --
It was right up on the PG&E property over there.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Yes, every day.  Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this.  But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Jack.
Well, this is some surprise.  Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Let me get the light.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
No -- what?
PG& -- Are you sure?
What's going on in there?
The tall trees...
Yes...
Long ago...
That. And less strange.
Number twenty-two's thighs are just great.  Who's he?
Hello again, neighbour. I didn’t intrude, did I?
Must be your lucky day then. I’ve got your accounts - you don’t owe much tax for last year.
It's been the same one for three months.
Yes. But my boss reckons you’d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It’d cost you about £100 but he said it’d be worth it.  Of course, you’d need a partner to register. But that’s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Hurry!
Are they ready yet?
Well, does it make sense to you?
Oh!
It's your game.  I've never played this before.
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that.  I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
Come on, now--you've forgotten all about that.
Women have a curious taste for knickknacks. When I found out about Ned--tried to make a break--Lee wouldn't stand for it and--well--here I am!
Were you always funny?
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do?  He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river!  But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why?  Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Sure!  When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job!  A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius— Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe—and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What kind of person lives like this?  Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
Why?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Yes, but... I thought...
No, I will.  I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you.  You're a liar, and a thief.
I do.  It feels like how being in love should be.  Floating through a dark blue sky.
You're right.
I might do it wrong.
Doing what?
It'll come back, Daddy.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
That's just --
Who is that?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Ok, bye.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
Another young man.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
Oh, Jack, you are a wild man to use me so.
Duff, I love you.
Benjamin --
How can you put this on my shoulders?
You too.
Thank you, Peter.  Thank you so much.
What?
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
Oh, God.  Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Nine seconds.
Um... that's very relaxing.
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days.  I'd like you to get your stuff out.
He'll live through it.  They all live through it.  What a world, huh?
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
I'm serious.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's not bad, it's ok.
It was going too fast.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
Never mind the Who's Who--Before I get on this boat I want to know What's What! How about my raise? All I get out of these ocean trips is dizzy.
Is that one of the Who's Who?
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed?  I've been a jerk, right?  I should have stayed!  I was supposed to be in love... I was in love!  I am in love, why did I act like a bitch?  He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy.  It was too good to be true.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
I know, I know!  I'm a terrible person...  It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
But why do you want a divorce?
But what?
With a rich husband and this year's clothes you will not find it difficult to make some new friends.
But that is no reason to get a divorce!
I said when I think about you, I get wet.
I teach part time at the Junior College.  What if I told you I was through with Nuke?  He learned his lessons quickly and left me.
I don't imagine there's much I could teach you.
Crash, I get wet just thinking about you.
I'm ready for a complicated man.
Grunemann? I've looked at him a --
Sorry.
You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
You haven't eaten your lunch.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
You know, no offense or anything Kate, but I think I'm starting to see Larry's side of the story.
What's that supposed to mean?...
You will?
I'm hungry.
You...
You expecting somebody you know?
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
On... Once...  Once... What are we... you going to do?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
The staff don’t know yet...  I called my parents, told them everything...  I just couldn’t take any more...
So, this is what you do?  I mean when you're not playing other parts?
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY  I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I don’t know. Everyone’s dead...
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
That's fine--because you're going to see a lot of me ... for the rest of your life.
You like it, too.
Yes, dear, I know.
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I’m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son.  But he’s a good guy. He’ll listen to you. He won’t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
In English.  I'll fuck your brains out.
No.
No more games, Nick.  I'm tired of playing games!
You won't believe me.
I paid him $50,000 in cash for your psychiatric file.
About three months before I met you.
I will. You're terribly direct in your questions.
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Thank you.
Ok.
Thank you.
Adam?  Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry.  I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Yeah, it was.
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
People change...you know.
Betty. It's O.K. except I'm worn out. We spent all weekend looking for her doctor-boy. How can a big time heart guy leave no trace of himself?
She's gonna have to 'cause I'm out of ideas.
Probably the same thing my mom would do if I got engaged... have a heart attack.
David Ravell.
What's the matter here?
I begged him to let me put that on!
Sure.
No -- he's lying.
Don't listen to him.  Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Shoot him.
Yeah.
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
You're leaving right now?
There you are!  My God, darling, I've been so worried.  Are you alright?
I can just feel my spirits soar.
Well, in times like these most people are cutting salaries, but suppose we say, in your case, three hundred and fifty?
Oh, madame, you're just too sweet for words!
You! And she's willing to pay as high as fifty francs!
Uh...
I can't... not yet...
I'm the clumsiest person in the world.
No, I know that part --
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Hi.
Alright.
I know.
Why not?
You saw a MiG 21?
Where did you see that?
It's what?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
You really think so?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff --  Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
We'll see.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
I want my paycheck.  By the end of the day.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too.  My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
Hey.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
Father, please don't die.
These are the ground rules.  I hook up with one guy a season-- I mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy--kinda my own spring training...  And, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.  So...  I thought we should get to know each other.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
I told him, get the important stuff, Kim's ring.  I'll collect the inconsequentials.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him.  Not near ready.  Not by the longest shot.  Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story.  I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
That's the problem.  When you're a kid you think life is gonna be like the movies.  Dreams come true, the good guys win, people live happily ever after... all that crap.  Turn.
No kidding?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
What?
One, up.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
I mean, just how long are you going to cling to this childish illusion that it's all supposed to be perfect?  Well, guess what?... It isn't.  Not for you, not for anybody.
I should have known.  I came into the house when you were down on the beach.  She looked at me so strangely.  She left right after you.  I shouldn't have let her watch us. She wanted to watch me all the time.  She tried to kill you, didn't she?
My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
I know the type.  I'm a psychologist.
Do you think I told her to kill You?
The kid is on.  You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Yes.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest.  As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I was jealous.  Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with.  But I didn't kill him.
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything.
How's that?
Okay, okay!  Take it easy!
Perry?
What is it?!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
£10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
They got the new T.V.
It's there.
Are you asleep?
I'd like that.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
They're going to send detectives.
George... how about Felicia?
I can still use a gun.
So how'd it go?
For how long?
Not before you agree to use those reservations to Moscow.
I wouldn't waken Leon. After last night I would say not before three o'clock at the earliest.
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Okay.
That's not it.
Oh, yes.  The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So?
You flew all the way h...
Wow. You look beautiful.
Trust me. This is bigger than Tony Pee-Pants.
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Walter.
I do.
We'll move them --
It's probably just the flowers --
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Yeah.  Thanks.
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Do you know?
What?
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
The truth is I hate them: they must hate me. All right, the money.  All right, not the money. A kind of put-on. It gets things back together.  Well let's say I'd go to one of these cattle-calls, a tryout. I mean before -- before I got this job -- and they'd always say thank you very much and i'd feel, you know, brought down. They didn't want me.
I said that.  Well, so you have a choice. You can either feel lonely -- you know, the hate -- or --  So you take a call and go to a hotel room and there's some John you've never seen before, but he wants you. He must, he's paying for it.  And usually they're nervous and that's all right, too, because you're not; you know this thing. And then for a while, boy, they really pay attention, you're all there is.  And it's not real and you don't have to even like them -- you can even hate them, it's all right, it safe -- you know?
Love me... keep me safe...
You met people.
Thanks.  Well...
Watched television?
He'll file.  He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me.  That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
Yeah.  I'm sure it's keeping you up nights.
Since when do you care about the homeless?
Fuck Kurt.
Why not?
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
I came for love...
I don't know.
Ted...
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five.  "But this shall you deal with them.  You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
I spoke to your father the other day.
His assistant. He acted like Marlin's son, only he wasn't. At least they never said he was... I bet they were lovers, faggots. Yes, gay lovers. Wild Kingdom my ass!
Marlin Perkins and Jim!
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
Yes, it is.
Foley <i>kid</i>napped me.
My married boyfriend - setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity.  I couldn't believe it.
What'd I say?
He wouldn't say.
Be careful?  You mean you - or me? Who?
There was no plan! I was just young and stupid and scared!
It's my daughter! Go after her.
I'll shout to my heart's content! I'll scream if I want to.
Ah! Coconut layer cake. Nice and gooey, too. Just the way I like it.
I won't thank you! I'll never thank you!
Please don't shout.
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
Yes!  But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Poor Hannah.
I can't say anything!
Why?
Don't you think she does?
At least she isn't drinking.  Did you notice?
Mm-hm.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Yeah.
Ohh?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
It's a horrible idea! Is that what I'm here for? To make you feel that you're with someone that's dead?
Mom, we already...
Excellent.
She's the boss.
You buckled up?  You cold?
They loved you.  I told you they would love you and they did.
...We know so little about each other.
Can't you forget for just one night that you're completely wretched?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
Yes, I know.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
That's not true.
How about this?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
And I want to make things perfect for you.  You're right, Kev, we do have something good...and special.
Now this is cute.
Did you know that it's...450 miles from Ann Arbor to Nashville?
Yes, I know.
Give it back? Are you nuts?
Y'know if you make it to the Bigs you could still become the host of Dance Fever.  Baseball's a good stepping stone for things like that.
There is a lot of things you never thought of, sweetie--now get some rest for tonight's game.
Why are you going here? What is here?
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you.  Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Watch me do what?
I don't have any time to see you now.  I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Then why are you here, Joe?
Joe --
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
...it's too bad you're such an asshole. 'S the only thing that Del was ever right about.
Mmm-hmm. Listen, I forgive you, Mr. McCord...
Well then what are you trying to do-
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
That's okay.  I'm probably, you know, busy.
-- very nice, very nice.
No kidding.
We were just dancing--
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
You're going to kill me.
No.
Because I don't want you to.
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine.
We did it.
What?
More!  More!
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Don't say that...
Charlie...
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them.  That was noth- ing.  Now change me.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Yes, I noticed he was getting a little fat lately.  Ouch!
I need to make some calls. Could I use... your office?
Nobody has.  So far.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
A bully? Moi?
Well?
I understand perfectly.
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up.  First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
But you saw it here.
But now you don't have to--
Please. Because I love you.  He stares at her, sees the pleading look in her eyes, and lets go. She turns and walks away toward the church, slowly, her head bowed. He watches her go and starts to move after her. Then slowly, as she goes, her head begins to go up until finally, as she walks, she is staring high above her.  And then, suddenly, she breaks into a broken run.
Let me go into the church alone.
And if you lose me, you'll know that I loved you and wanted to go on loving you.
Sorry, honey...  I'll be right there.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
That's God's way!
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Who is Friedman?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?
You bet I will, Ma.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
You're so romantic...
Yeah.
Yes.
Good.  Where are the English?
I don't know -- I don't know.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Yeah what?!
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Bad dream, darling?
You've got to be kidding.
Dristan nasal spray.
Yeah.
Now?
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Did you feel anything?
My mother would die.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
The play's going to be really good.
Yes you did.
You don't miss a thing.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
You think so? Do you really?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Where were you?
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Good evening, comrade.  This man is horribly old. You should not make him work.
Is this what you call the "butler"?
He looks sad. Do you whip him?
He called me "Doc."
Take this to Ebby in the dugout between innings.
It says he's not bending his back on his follow-through.
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
You're soaking.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Enough of what?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
Manslaughterer, honey, not murderer. Don't exaggerate.
Thank the Lord. Well, you ain't let me down yet, Sailor. That's more'n I can say for the rest of the world?
What kinda trash talk is that?
That's disgustin'. Those kinda sentiments shouldn't be allowed out in public. Is this Biloxi yet?
Where's the money?
Oh, no.
You think so?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Here, hold up!
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
Yes.
No.
I was at home.
Why would we do that?
You know it is!
It doesn't matter.
No -- but I can get it for you.
What?
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Lauren?
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
What do you mean?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I haven't made up my mind.
You serious about having him over?
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Why fucking not!  I deserve it.
I've been trying to find you all day.
No. I never feel like that.
I think we made a mistake here.
Fine, Quincy.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Sorry about your game.
How?
What?
I do. I really do.  OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
He doesn't trust you.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
A werewolf?
Buddy's sister Regina Mary Bragg got two calls from Buddy up in Detroit this morning, called Burdon.  She's also the one gave Burdon Buddy's address.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Are they gross or something, like guy stuff?  Tell me.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
Is there anything I can do?
I didn't have time.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real.  I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Got a shovel?
There's probably one in the basement.
Jeff, if you're squeamish, just don't look.
You know, Miss Fremont -- he might just have something there.
What for?
Right.
Well. He said to "make the house mine."
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
You're shaking.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead.  I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Let him try.
Dad, I'm sorry.
It's not going very well -- and it's our last day.
Drink tea -- there's lots of tea.
We haven't seen each other since high school.
What do you want me to do?  Scream?  I don't think it would help much.  I'm just gonna sit back, take it easy, and wait for you to screw up.
Sorry.
Loser.
Call me later.
No, you have to touch it.  You have to run your hands over it, get close to it, really reach out and feel. You try it.
It goes on and on.
What do you think?
It was my last. I then became infatuated with these -- my "Odorifics."
Now I'll pump it up...  ... and you just turn the handles.  Okay. What do you smell?
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning -  "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
He's waiting for you.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't care.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Nothing.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me!  It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Why not?
I just don't think it would...
I just don't think it would work.
Tomorrow?
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible...  She loves you, George.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
We keep them.
What's your other question?
Where have you been?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you.  You were with her, weren't you?
I never eat when I'm serene.
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
Hi.
...which I did not get.
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
I'm crucifying him.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Okay, I guess.
It's funny to look back. I was brought up on goat's milk, I had a ration of vodka in the army, and now champagne.
I wouldn't know. The closest I ever came to champagne was in a newsreel. The wife of some president was throwing it at a battleship.
I could be her.
No. But you tend to tie them up.
But, you know, so what?
He left me my passport and ticket. It's pretty clear he wants to see me again.
He will come back.
Neat...
Um-hum.
Queen Harry?
Oh.  Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
That's because you can hardly see through those things.
Oh sure, everything is complimentary. Until you get the bill.
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Yes, well...
I can't take no more of this radio...  I ain't never heard so much concentrated weirdness in my life, Sailor Ripley, you find me some dancin' music right this minute... I MEAN IT!!
HOLY SHIT!! IT'S THE NIGHT OF THE LIVIN' FUCKIN' DEAD!!!!
I'll bet.
Damn!
There's a guy here on the task force right now.  Maybe I should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.
I told you what happened in Rome!
Because it seemed stupid and foolish.
Yes.
It said, "Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality." That's what it said.
I don't give a damn what you believe!
Dr. Hirsch?
What shall we do?
Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
Shut up.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
Never look behind -- only ahead!
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
You going there?
The kids take me.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I want you to come.
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
God, I adore you.
Shit.
With who?
We should head over.
Zeke.
No, it's more like a leave of-  Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
-- yes, Jill.
Andy!
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard.  I have no wish to go riding.
You must get out of here. It's not safe.
Without the Mask it doesn't matter.
It must be tough, having to be Clark Kent.
We get the Mask I'll tell you.
Danny's not coming?
What does that mean?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
No nuns, got it.
There's a piano in the street.
Do you know them.
I thought they opened at seven.  If I left my car would it be ok?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
Any good?
I can't even say it.
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, WE'RE HAVING A SERIOUS CONVERSATION!
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
They're tight.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
You're a prince.
Hi.
Hi.
Pray you be sweet as your words, dear Jack.
No.
Yeah.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Oh!  And then this one time?  At band camp?  I stuck a flute in my pussy.
Winston Churchill.
What, you think I don't know how to get myself off?  Hell, that's what half of band camp is!  Sex ed!
Frank!
I'll think about it...
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
And you didn't tell her?
She what?!
What?...
I'll bring it back as soon as I can.
I'm sorry. This just means so much to me.
Somewhat better than that temple scroll you were bidding on.
The most important piece of Chinese art outside of China.
I suspected it might be worthy of your interest.
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Where'd a sweet Southern boy learn to fight like that?
So he really loved her?
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Just moved in with his girlfriend.
How about that guy at the bank?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
No.  He smokes.
No!
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
How about the other one?  His friend.
Make what?
Why'd you do that?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
Well, I guess we're not, since we don't have dates .
That's what he says, but if he thinks that I don't realize he's writing another article, then he's an idiot.
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Okay, okay, we won't go.  It's not like I have a dress anyway
How was I to know, my darling?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit.  I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him?  Do you recognize him?
What do you mean, poetry?
Isn't he the policeman that you shot, Shooter?
Please.
Fine.
STOP! You're making...mistake.
There's a name from the past.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
I feel in love with George again.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
What?
Where are you?!
Okay.  I just thought as long as it was paid for --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Tir Asleen.
Use the philosopher's stone!  Hur- ry!  Invocation!  Release them!
Yep.
I'm the best.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Nervous?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Wow.  But I still don't see how ...
I don't believe you.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Thank-you.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Tch.
Thanks.
Okay.
Hi.
I am not!
So why don't you come right out and tell me what you're talking about?
Didn't you tell me one-time calls aren't monitored?
I'm gonna throw up, Frank.  I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
You are such a great person Lloyd.  I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Listen Stew baby, let's not talk about things like that now—
Emil the Amazing.  The bastard fired me and hired another girl, a redhead. I'm working on a new business card, pass out to the cafes.  How's this sound--
What's free about it?  I'm looking for work.
See you.  Bye.  Bye Diane.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
Where did you go last night? What did you do?
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
He's adored me for nine goddamn years.
No! Don't! Please!
She knows him maybe five seconds, plus she has billions of dollars, plus she's perfect, so don't go feeling sorry for Miss Pre-Teen Illinois!
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Well do you like him?
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No... I can't!
Okay.
Eyes closed.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
Yeah, what?
What do you mean?
Yes.
Yes.
I know.
Wynant dead?  Does Dorothy know?
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
For a while.
Yeah?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
So.  I guess I've got a wedding to go to.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
No.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Is it?
I don't.
Huh?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good.  Everything's fine.
That's it! Yes, that's it! ... Jacques!
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
At twelve twenty. I know.  Lyons two, four, seven, one.  Two more days and we'd have seven hundred and fifty thousand francs more!
and I keep, you know, it's-
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold".  What about you? What are you thinking about?
You can die slowly cut into a thousand pieces.
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
Okay.
Together.
Lipstick?
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
That's your name?
What would your mother say to that?
Hi, everybody.  Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
You ate?
We've met.
-- This morning.  The Corinth Coffee Shop.  He was looking for a doctor.
Who?
Yes, sir.
Hey man. . .  You don ' t think I can be "cool"?  You don't think I can be "laid back" like everyone else?
What a gruesome proof of the power of the press!
Don't you find that restful?... Why didn't you come last night?
Did you win?
Oh, Leon, you are so good to me.
Those newspaper people?
No.  We had a drink at the club. We left together.  I came here. He went home.
No.  I wasn't in the mood to have sex with anyone last night.
Read me my rights and arrest me and I'll go downtown.
Because I want to know what's happening.
What's the matter?
What is it?
The Vespa? Me hanging on behind in the rain all night?
Hello, may I speak to Mitch Brenner, please?  Yes, I'll wait.
... always.  The best dim sum, the best camping stuff...
Stop, we're embarrassing h...
It's not just clubs.  This guy always knows the best everything. The best guitar store, the best beef ribs, the best Horowitz record, was he always like the...
That's not why we're going out.
Don't you want to change?
Okay. But I'm back in half an hour.
What about your glasses?
Go to Jim Morrison's grave at Pere Lachaise. It's overrun with American tourists. I have to work.
Good evening, Anna.
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
We've been through this.
Lyndon Johnson?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
You don't want me.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from.  I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
Maybe not her least... There’s always--
Get them out of here!
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
It's his name.
Oh, it was...  really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Well I guess this is it.
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Oh.
A mistake?
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
And what will he do?
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?
How's it going.
Hi.  It's me.  I got a favor to ask you.
Got anyplace special in mind?
How about that one? The Host of the Old South Hotel.
I H-A-T-E hotel bedspreads. They don't hardly never get washed, and I don't like the idea of lyin' on other people's dirt.
What's that, honey?
It's huge. This musta been a grand old place at one time.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
... well I'm glad you told me.
I can't lie here.  I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
Hurry, Suzette.
This is me telling you about me.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later.  I can't live like this!
Want anything special for dinner?
Okay.
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Uh-huh.
Says who?  Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo.  Is it your story?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
Mighty decent of you, pal.
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Yes.
I'm very neurotic.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
You were <i>both</i> in the trunk?  Together?
The FBI didn't tell you I was with them?
From Glades to the turnpike.  Then I left with Glenn.
But you know what I'm talking about, don't you?  About Glenn, don't you, and the second car?
They didn't <i>tell</i> me anything, they asked questions.
I'm getting ready to go out.  You can come in if you want, sit down for a minute.  Would you like a Diet Coke?
I know a Glenn.
No, thanks.
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
On the high seas, your ship attacked, and the Dread Pirate Roberts never takes prisoners.
Oh, when it comes to you I am. Not that I don't understand why they all need you. but they can't need you more than I do.
Nothing you can say will upset me.
You mock my pain!
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and...  and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
You are?
Bye.  She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Hey, who's that?
She took you shopping for a tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
Excuse me!  You went to a party with her?
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
I guess so.
Yes.  You walking to the subway?
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
Want to play the game?
You say the truth.  Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
True.
That's just it. It makes people feel queer. I dont' want you to get in any trouble.
I haven't talked to anyone about Paris. I haven't said a word.
I'll tell you later.  That Gurganov, you never know whether he's on his way to the washroom or the Secret Police.
It just goes to prove the theory of our State. If you stand alone it means a boiled egg but if you're true to the collective spirit and stick together you've got an omelet.  That reminds me... have you heard the latest they're telling about the Kremlin?
Well, I've saved up two eggs and each of my friends is bringing his own so we'll manage.
An omelet! Aren't you living a little above your ration?
Ever since you have been back from Paris...
About what?
And you too, Ninotchka.
You should be more careful, Anna.
I said I'll think about it.
Better believe it.
Why?
Well, naturally. Of course.
I don't want to be safe. I want to be with you.
What time is it?
When will they stop?
You must be exhausted.
I can't believe it!
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Then come.  I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
Buddy and Sparky come by earlier.
You been drinkin', huh?
Can't tell yet. Where'd you go?
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...
I just came from the school, madam. I don't know about their brain pans but...
I'm staying with the Countess.
Just relax.
I'll get home all right now.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women.  They can't get enough of me.
Sometimes.  But what's the alternative, not playing?  You remember big Toni?  She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore.  I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here.  We just played in the championship game.  It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
What?  You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
I wouldn't know.
How?
Shall we vote him in, Stella?
So.  Is now a good time?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
You asked me to dine with you tonight.
I don't believe it!
We cannot go into this later.
Oh, but it will end well for love?
Well, I can't.
At eleven at night? _ 70.
He just lost his best client.  He called from the plane.  I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome."  It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome.  And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
So, what’s your point?
That was a long time ago.
What do you want it to be?  Vivian, my name's Vivian.
Yes...
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
I suppose it is.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
No, but, no, not at all.  I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and -  - such good manners for someone worried about mines.  That's all.
Excuse me.  Yes?  I don't have the key to that door.
I see.  Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach.  He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I like the freak show.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
What happened?
Perfect.
It's only on exhibit at the Queen's Museum this month. Even if you could get into the museum, the Mask bas its own security system. A special, randomly programmed interval code.
Call me again soon? I'll be waitin' by the phone.
There we are!
Oh, good! Oh, wonderful.
What did you say?
I want to ask you a question.  Do you think...time travel is possible?
Yes?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
May I help you?
Where?
You were going to see her?
Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs --
If...  If... when we get to San Francisco...  If they're already there?
We'd never make it. They're probably all over the road.
Where can we go, Mitch? There's no place to go.
But they'll be back.
-- especially one like this.
No!
You want some?
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep.  Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
That headboard.
-- and take this with you.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
Let go!
You set me up.
I just wanted --
Okay, okay. Okay.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah.
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
So what'd they say?
That water's freezing!
Daddy!
Who are you?
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
I did.
What?
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Try four and a half. At first I totally didn't like him.
It was a long time ago, at some Heaven and Hell mixer.
Hello... yes, he's here with me now... I don't know if he's hot, he's my son, you perv! I'll call you back...  Oh my God, I will call you back, goodbye.  That was my friend, Michelle, she says "hi."
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm not the maid!
There's a man here to see you, Sweetheart.
Uh --
Fast.
A lot of works.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much?  Wow...Okay...See you there...
You want to go to a movie tonight?
Personally, I think it's stupid!  But go ahead. Have a good time. As long as Ellie doesn't object.
...yeah.
Fine. I'll see you at the reception.
... that this is all my fault?
You don't have to say that.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
No -- I'm a survivor.
He is my secretary! I hope that answers all your questions, M'sieu Giron.
I know!
To M'sieu Laval?
That's where you're wrong.  I got one nine years ago.  I just never had an opportunity to use it.
Where are we going, Jerry?
Now what?
What about your job?
We're going to Queens?
It's still the new year...
But it's July.
I've known a lot of everybody.
Where's Mike today?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing you don't know how much he hates your guts.
Well... the store at Saltzburg...  But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
I'm a liberal!
Okay.  Good idea.  You first.
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
What bus?
Eight o'clock.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
That's not very complimentary, either.
We were in some of the same classes.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Well, I do.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
The ones in the box of files.  The box of files?  The one from your office?
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along.  I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
Unbelievable.
It's a swift spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.
Jesus. Marty. You're pathetic. It sounds like you need a Shockabuku.
Let me get this straight, are you asking me out?
<u>What</u>!
I can't tell you how distraught I was.  All night long.  What the hell happened?
<u>Oh my God</u>... <u>What did they do</u>!  <u>My</u> <u>God</u>!!!
Go for a walk in Central Park --
Arlyn, just tell me, did Jane have a dumper, one of her regular Johns?
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
You know how the Sisters are.
Come with me?
Oh.  Okay.
Now, did you remember that, or...
I couldn't ask you to.
I don't mind, really.
Mitch has always done exactly what he wanted to do.  I'm not complaining. That's the mark of a man.  But...  You see, I... I wouldn't want to be... be left alone. I don't think I could bear being left alone.  I... forgive me. This business with the birds has me upset.  I... I don't know what I'd do if Mitch weren't here.
Why don't you try to sleep now, Mrs. Brenner.
I wish I were stronger.  Do you think she's all right? Do you think she's safe at the school?
Would you like me to go for her?
Yes, I think so. My son is important to me. I want to like any girl he chooses.
And if you don't?
Then I don't suppose it'll matter much to anyone but me.
I think it might also matter to Mitch.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
George Bailey lassos stork.
My baby.
You'll always be there.  In his mind.  The perfect creature he loved for all those y...
... except one.
I refuse to resign!
Okay.
Okay.
How about Cinderella—or a real hot love story?
You always want to run everything.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's bad.
Nobody knows.
Five-- Six--
<u>Shut</u> <u>up</u>--<u>kiss</u> <u>me</u>!  Wasting all this marvelous time with arguments!
But attractive--
Four thousand.
Five full nights... days too?
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Alvy.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Boy, sweetie, this is weird, okay.
Oh, baby, what an idea. I'd always be happy to see you, no matter what.
Sometimes dreams just don't mean nothin'... Stuff comes into your mind and you don't have no control over, you know? Anyways, dreams ain't no odder than real life. Sometimes not by half.
What're you gonna do next?
Let's go in.
You abide by rules like that?
I was.
Don't.  I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Enough with the clothes--
I only went for my last two years.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Excuse me?
It’s called character. God, you’re predictable.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Call if you get weird.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Sure.
Why do you say that?
So that's it, just forget about us?
Whoa, Jeffrey. Slow down. You and me, we’re the past. I’m not sure if you noticed, but I’m here with someone else.
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Your i --
You mean you know about this?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
And I said I would never leave you.
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
It won't last.
Yes I am.
Yes, you do.
I found some in my purse; would you like one?
It teaches you to lie.
Please leave.
Go!
Put the bolts on that window under a scope, I'm betting you'll find wrench scratches on them.
Bingo.
He unscrewed the bolts, reset them on rollers, then slid the whole frame away. No more effort than it takes to vacuum a floor.
Let a thousand flowers bloom. Chairman Mao.
Meaning no one arranges calalilies like that. He left the window open when he came in. His only mistake.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I love you, Wally.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA...&quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought&quot;.
Nothing.  There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
No -- I like it.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger.  Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states.  Time would just collapse, I would be inside time.  I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped.  Freaky stuff.
Much better.
Seven, eight.  So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you.  I loved it so much, that feeling.
Uncle Pooch died in a car crash three years later while he was holidayin' in Myrtle Beach. They still got way too much traffic there for my taste... And another thing, baby... That government of ours should be keepin' us separated from outer space...
One hundred twenty decibels - head on collision of a '54 Ford Pick-Up and a '64 Chevy Station Wagon. No survivors. Balls of flame and grinding metal.
Just you. Uncle Pooch never acted strange or different after. And he never did anything else to me. I always got a nice present from him at Christmas, like a coat or jewelry?
That woman's laugh creeps me out. I heard somethin' like that... somewhere before... Sound'd like the wicked witch...
Sailor, that ozone layer is disappearin'. Seems to me the government could do somethin' about it. One of these mornings the sun'll come up and burn a hole clean through the planet like an X-Ray.
I'm always ready to dance. But I need me a kiss first, honey. Just one?
I can't say he was anybody!
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
He has a point.
You threw them out!
I more than liked it.
I can't believe this is happening. I'm supposed to be meeting him in an hour.
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
Hello.
Magda!
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
Yeah. What?
I'm listening.
Maybe you wanted to.
We'll take the Royal Suite!
The fourteenth of May.
I don't know.
You sure?
Drunk isn’t the same thing as happy, Amy.
It's all right.
Not exactly.  It's certainly huge.
That's not what I hear.
What do I have to do to stop it?
That's what you get flight pay for.
I'm being a pain, huh?
I'm  fine.  Really.
Nothing.
Yes.  Hic!
A room... there is a room, and I sit there alone... always alone...
I will not hear any more about my safety!!  You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
Afraid I'm ruining your reputation, M'sieu Laval?
Talk? About me--about us?
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
M'sieu Laval, I've got a confession to make to you ...
Watch this!
Why?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Calvin?!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
He did. Captain Renault did.
No.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
My husband is with me, too.
Who is it?
What happened?
No, no.
Wow, Kev...it's perfect.
What?
That's exactly what you are.
Thanks, Roy, you're sweet... a big liar, but sweet. I liked your editorial this morning...
Excuse me?
I'm the stenographer.
No. Like a man.
Sure.
No.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
You mean tonight?
Shhh.
I remember everything. All I have are memories.
Money!
Mostly I remember...the nights when we were together. I remember how you used to hold me...and how I used to sit on your face and wriggle...and then afterwards how we'd watch until the sun came up. When it did, it was almost like...like each new day was created...only for us.
Later?
Not unless you hear my confession.
350 pounds.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Uh-uh.
Wyatt...
So?...
On now, Stew, don't be too hard on her. I wouldn't call her a brewery horse.
You're implying th...
David, stop!
David, what are you doing?
David, please be rational. Let's go to Dr. Hirsch.
Jack is dead!
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please.  M'mrnm.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Tell it like it is.
He's very caring, in his way.  You haven't seen him at his best.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
Good night, Mike.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
Great! Great!  Goddammit!  Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
All right. All right. All right.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel?  My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so?
Brutal frankness, if you insist.
All right, I'll listen.
Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll...
Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you?
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Really, Sailor, it ain't nothin' against you. I love you.
Why have you brought me here?
Do you feed on mice and rats?
Damn you!
I'd soon die.
I got married. I didn't want to. It all happened so fast.
Really?  How flattering!  Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba.  That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Patrick -- is that- a.
Where's egghead?
I don't know.  It's hard figuring you two as brothers.  Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
I tried him, he can't go.  His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
Easy, now.
He's a very private person, actually.
What's that supposed to mean?
We have to go back!
After he tried to shoot you?
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts.  _ 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster.  You meet Chad the nanny?
Well, Steve?
Are we leaving?
Yes, for your hair.
Try this.  I found a great jar of it. Olive oil.  In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
He was sittin' there havin' a beignet at the Cafe Du Monde. Do you think he saw us?
As you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation My motives were questioned. I was slandered in court.
Simon just ejected!
Well, we had a choice. Steak or fish.
Yes.
No.
Can too.
He lost all the weight... there.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
He had fish.
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Didn't you tell her?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Always?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
Want a drink?
What is it, Harold?
Yes.
Back to California
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
What's your name?
No.
Don't for one minute think that you had any effect whatsoever on my panties.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
If I want you to turn me on I'll pay <u>you</u> three hundred.  Just lay back and let me drive.
Yes. Those little pieces of paper with your picture on it?
No, the reason I ask is--
Really?
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Hey, listen.  You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
Nothing personal --
Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch?
Yes.  I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired.
The oriental.
You will be discreet about this?
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I'm sorry.
Promise me you won't fall in love with an inmate.
He's just exhausted.
Well, thanks for the lift.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
I should've told you, but you would've thrown me out, right?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
No.
May I ask what has happened?
Oh, they shouldn't do such things. Are you sure this report is correct?
You want me to go to Constantinople?
I appreciate the confidence you show in me, but I must ask you to entrust someone else with this mission. I should hate to interrupt my present work. I am positive that my survey is more important than finding out whether three of our comrades have been drinking some extra glasses of champagne.
No. I feel more like - yodeling.
It's sinking, Harold. Going over the horizon - where we are all going to go. It's getting dark. "Let each man hold on to his candle and get a light where'er he can."
From the guys who got the matches, of course.
Oh, Harold. You make me feel like a schoolgirl.
Oh.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
Uh huh.
Oh-kay...
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
What about money?
Any luck?
That's swell!
He does this every year?
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
...Paulie. Stop now!
Free?
I still don't see what it has to do with the President.
Testing some top secret seismic weapon.
Sure, why?
Take them back, Suzette.
He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.  I said I would.
Do you think I should go?
It seems so pointless.  I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day.  My luggage.
I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie.
It's really up to Lydia, isn't it?
That's up to you.
But I'll have cocktails with you.
Seemed like weeks and weeks.  Such a terrible dream... I could never tell you...
Sweet Jack.  I'm so sorry you found me asleep.  Don't know what came over me.
Oh!  Green Jack!  What a dream I've had... proper nightmare.
What's that?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
What? No, of course not.
I don't know where he is.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Slow down, slow down.
This is important to me.
What?
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
I'm sorry about --
It was everything.
-- I guess you haven't.
Never tried, 'til now.  Joe, may I kiss you?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Yeah.
Hey, wait a minute!
How?
We never met in court or anyplace else.
When?
So why are they after you?
What newsletter?
You're certifiable.
Believe you about what?
Isn't that her picture?
Very simple, Earl.
No, Earl, not at all.  Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
You matter to me.  Completely.
Well, what do you do?  Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what?  Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back?  Do you?  You must.  They- they seem to know so much about us.
That was so good I am gonna have another.
Hi
Are you following me?
I'm sorry.  I haven't been very fair to you.  That's why I came here to the store this evening.  I feel terrible, Rob.  This is really hard, you know.
What's the obvious stuff?
Then tell them I had a seizure.
No.
I am.
What are you doing?
What were you thinking coming here?
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Well I know he's come here before.
Thirteen.  The last time, can you believe it?  This is how he says "Goodbye?"
I didn't know what else to do...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
I can’t believe you want to move back into the city.  I thought the reason we left was because we didn’t want to raise the kids here?
And this is Helen Carter.
Giovanni, this is Faith's friend, Peter.
Ten billion to one.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Be careful.
Yes, you!
Me, either.
Money is no object.  He's got cards up the wazoo.
So, what are you seeing?
Exactly.  You understand that, don't you?  You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
The first and the last.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Dad, I love him.
Well, for later then.
You thought that up all by yourself, huh?
So were you.
He ain't Spalding.
The wind blows... the fire burns...
Where’s Nick sleeping?
My mother has a rule about men and women sleeping in the same room without a ring in the picture. She thinks it’s--
Huh?
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Oh, all right--  See you later, Toots.
Never mind.
It's a wonder I'm not panic stricken.
Thanks.  You think this whole business is silly, don't you? I mean running away and everything.
Please.  I need to know.
What do you want to do?
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
I had a checklist in mind.  I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash.  But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
Hi, Adam.  This is, uh....
Name it.
C'mon Lloyd.
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Anything for you.
Ike... Hi, Grandma.
You know, there's no...
Well, we're really out in the middle of it now, ain't we?
If you say so.
My mama...  So Sailor, our histories have been somewhat intertwined.
I take that as a sign that we were destined by fate to be together.
I do trust you, Sailor. Like I ain't never trusted nobody before.
I've no fear of failure.  Your implications are most unbecoming.
I took them out.
They mocked me. They were representations of people I dearly loved yet they knew these people were gradually fading from me, and that in time all I would have left would be vague feelings - but sharp photographs! So I tossed them out. My memory fades, I know. But I prefer pictures made by me with feeling, and not by Kodak with silver nitrate.
She went out to check into skywriting.  I can't believe you lied.  Is this a genetic thing, men will say anything just to get laid?
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
I'm making you a steak.
Thanks. I will.
Bye-bye!
And the idea is that the Beautiful Mad Carlotta has come back from the dead, to take possession of Elster's wife?  Ah, Johnny! Come on!
Is she pretty?
Think?  Well, what do you think?
No, not Carlotta. Elster's wife.
Thanks.  But guess who was there auditioning?
But the Scotch salmon was so fucking good, you decided to stay for brunch!
I had the craziest dream last night?  Walter and Kimmy had asked your boss to...
BECAUSE SHE'S AS CHICKENSHIT AS YOU ARE, YOU MORONS ARE MADE FOR EACH OTHER.
I need morphine.  A lot.  And a pistol.
Any time.
Yes.
What do you mean?
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
But Dad'll never go for it.
It would be fantastic.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
Say, "Thanks very much!"
Exciting, wasn't it? Where's Jimmy?
Shoot him.
Santos...
NO... For God's sakes, Santos!
That's your business... I don't care how.
All right... I want you... to... kill... Sailor... As simple as that.
I said fine.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so...  George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was...  shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War.  Anyway, so, so...  George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so...  so, he's dead ...  he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie...  Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
Leave me alone! You were willing to sacrifice a hundred thousand francs for her.  Well--  she's worth it! [ You were willing to pay a hundred and twenty-five thousand for a <u>handbag</u>. You can pay a <u>hundred</u> thousand for him!]
You ain't kiddin', we got lives to start over, we should go somewhere where we can really start from scatch.
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Get out of my house. You’re fired, Mr Lombard.
No! Don't!
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Why not?
You want to talk?  Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
[Within] Juliet!
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
I don't know.  I'm not sure.
I suppose.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him.  That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes.  I suppose it's possible.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
Maybe.
Live happily ever after.
How hard can it be?  I'll land there, I'll go to his hotel, I'll introduce myself, and--
You're coming with me?
I keep it in the glove compartment in case of emergencies.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
I believe it.  You've ruined a nine- hundred-dollar suit my dad gave me.
It doesn't feel right to me.  I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Would you excuse me?
Big enough?
Yeah, I know.
The drums. He taught me to play some.
Oh, I suppose you could do better.
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Guess!
Well, I guess it's safe to put on some lights now.
Aahhh...  So what color is it?
What?
You sure? Maybe next week we could...
Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
No... what about your sister?
I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
To Old Madrid.
Oh, there you are--
Gee.
Who?
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
Oh, cut the crap!
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
You know there's only one man in the world for me, Johnny-O.
Yes.
What?
So, he's not my type.  Let me walk you to the elevator.
No.
No.
I don't know.  I don't think so.
Is he gay?
Marty...
No...
No...
Marty...
Yes.
Sorry I can't return the compliment.
Not you.  You won't be comfortable unless you're distinctive.
I thought bridesmaids had to wear the same dress.
The twin part.  I like to remain impartial in my contempt.
Which was the disqualifying factor?
... you hate weddings, you never go.
What else did he tell you...
Yes -- she did.
Good luck, Buzz.
Charlie, how are you?
Dad made me go over and apologize the next day.
Rob. Please focus.
At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me?
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Give me that!
I don't understand.
He bled a bunch, but no, there was no peeing.
Oh take it!  Please take it!
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
What are you doing here?
He is real.
Does he know you think he's real?
You still in love?
Oh, God! You scared me! Yes...
Of course.
Daniels. I think they were after the children.
What were the crows after at the school?
I don't know why.
To...  To kill them.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester.
I'll need the Rembrandt now.
Everything.
I always knew you'd do the job.
Hi.
Why not?
You must have met a lot of swell society girls since you've been here. Don't you like them?
No. Are you?
You don't go out with girls very much, do you?
So you think we got 'em scared?
No, I don't want to go. I want to stay here.
Oh God.
He despises everything I stand for. He thinks I'm spoiled and pampered, and selfish, and thoroughly insincere.
Ridiculous!
No.
Who is he?
On the road.
Now, don't tell me you fell in love with a bus driver!
It'll do no good.  He despises me.
Oh, come now—
I don't know very much about him.  Except that I love him.
Well, if it's as serious as all that—we'll move heaven and earth to—
Your ego is colossal.
I spaced out.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
The clothes are not important...
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same.  Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
You are the father.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
Think of me as your genie.  Just ask.
What's your name?
I follow the wires.
Why would anyone do this?
I promise you that was the right thing to do.  He's my good luck.  Now cut.  This one.  I hope we don't die.
I don't understand --
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him...  I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all.  He thinks I just want money.
You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Rational?!  Love is not rational! Are you crazy?
Maxine...
I love you, Lotte.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
Do you mind?
A girl?
Oh great, I ran out.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Oh, Chad--what about the rest of the show?
But he's interested!
I'm fine.
Splendid, Mother. Let's hop over to Monte Carlo. It's a great place to save a face.
I suppose you're going to print them?
Oh, I don't need another guess. It's quite obvious.
I'm not interested. Smythe will open the door.
Where did you get those letters?
Will you step into the library?
No, it isn't.  I called off my wedding all because of you.
I have a tiny apartment.
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Please. I'm not seeing anyone until this is over. One husband at a time.
I would like to marry you.  But I have already promised myself... to God.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
I'm dying.
Every week --
He has a reputation for being tough.
I don't know. Ruth kept her cool, but I could tell she was surprised.
Oh, God!
Lilly's up.
Well what does he want?
I don't know what his game is. He dismissed every one of Ruth's proposals. And Sarah, we weren't unreasonable.
I don't think so.  The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun--  --on this satellite right here.
I envy you, Jerome.
Nothing yet.  I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties.  But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's here.  My heart.  I'm careful--weekly check-ups.  I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet--  I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Of course I think about it every day.
You wouldn’t understand.
Well... goodnight.
You don't mean that.  You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me.  And vice versa. Okay?
Drew, you're out of line.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's...  Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
She calls him Tommy...
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Why do you always wear that hat?
I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
It's a lovely garden.
Cathy?
The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place.  Did you want to see Cathy about something?
Are you a friend of Mitch's?
No, not really.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
She called you 'George,' George.
...did I win some contest?
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
At Annie's house. She's all right.
Let's try a little harder, shall we?
Call me Alex.
Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Excuse me?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Miles is different. He's still so idealistic.
So what?
Kip - come and dance with me
But you're going through with it?
What are you doing?
He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy.
What?
I guess.
Access codes to the vault are changed daily, passwords for our computer on the hour...
How do I look?
He's here!... He's here!
I don't get why they'd do that.
And you can't?
At least they made an offer.
But can't you wait until morning—
Why, you can't put me out in the middle of the—
Going out as friends.
Okay.
We're very lucky.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
You already did.
Night.
-- A steal at eleven hundred dollars.
I know. We miss you too.
Oh.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Oh.  Hi.  I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Yes - isn't it?
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Anna?  With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love!  God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter.  Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal.  If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more.  But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead.  And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
Again?
You're back!  Hello.  We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
You called the police?
This girl has a child?
I thought you were married!
Tipico.
How 'bout me what?
Any school you want.
Can we get out of here?
And get someone to help around the house.
Five million dollars?
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
They'll run you out.
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Don't be too hard on him.
Why did I have to do this to myself?  Watch you take off.  Call me if you need anything.
It's okay.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
You take the front, I'll take the back.
Quiet, Mother.
I'll never get close to anybody.
Looks like your old workshop back on 42nd Street.
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
I bet.  That was our rent!
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
Raise away.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
'To bed'?
Where are you going?
I don't want to see you anymore.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
Shush!
Aw, shut up.  You had me at hello. _ 130.
We need to talk.
What are you talking about?
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
The doctor said it was okay.  Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
Okay.
She jumped out of the window.
Walter! D-did you see --  -- that?
I think so.
No, no, it's my fault -- we didn't have a proper introduction ---
Unsolved mystery.  She used to be really popular when she started high school, then it was just like she got sick of it or something.
Do you wish it, Jack?  Wish you this our wedding band?
You're going to drive me crazy!
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
Oh no, I don't think that would be a good idea.
Where's Positano?
Yes.  Isn't that amazing?
Amazing...
It mattered, Mom.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I'm trying.
That's all you cared about.  I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
That's ridiculous.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
This is Adam.  Adam, meet Cliff.
You came back for these?
Your stuff?  Let me see that.
Dead?
Neither has his heterosexuality.
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
Yes.  And so is birth.  Now look me in the eyes, Nuke--  You haven't been wearing my panties, have you?
Okay, what <u>ho</u>tel?
Honey, why don't you go in the car?  I'll be right there.
That makes me feel just terrible.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Say, you got a lulu.
Oh, I never catch colds.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
What motel you staying at?
You weren't at my game.
What variables?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Like hell.
Mama???
You know who it was and you know you aren't, and I mean ARE NOT gonna see him EVER... End of story.
...Yes you heard me... Don't ever call back here again.
There's no way in hell you can speak to her and...
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as <u>we</u> go, what time do you need?  What have we been doing here, except <u>time</u>?  Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
Why? He's right in the groove.
No.
Well... well, is everyone all right?
Yes.
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
I simply can not stand that tone!
Yup.  Not far from here, actually.
Who's that?
He always look so
I'm sure he's completely incapable of doing anything that interesting.
That's Pat Verona? The one who was gone for a year? I heard he was doing porn movies.
Patrick Verona   Random skid.
Block E?
Are you all right?
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
How would you know?
Nothing.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG&E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them.  But you know what?  They're wrong.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Tell me why.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Don't want to. I love you.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself.  You have my number.
I'll take a bus.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
Where's some paper?
How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful.
You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up.
It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore.
Something that brings warmth to my heart.  Duckbill platypus.
I think you're right.  Is there anything I can do to make it up to you?
You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud.
I hate rugrats.
Please.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Is anything wrong?
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
I'm <u>not</u> everyone else, Mr. Masry.  I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on.  I trusted you.  With my kids' well-being.  Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything.  But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
All your weapons, on the floor! Now!
Oh, hell.  I'm dyslexic.
Shut up, it's all right.  Do you want a drink?
...I've never tried it.
Are you kidding?  You've never double- clicked your mouse?
He likes it.
Of course he does.  What about you? Have you just never had one with Kevin -- or have you never had one, period?
I think I've had one.
Well that's a no.  No wonder you're not psyched about sex.  You've never even had one manually?
Look!
In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice...
No, not exactly.
Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right?
Cathy!
No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand.  You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch?
Your brother told me.
We don't need forty cars.
Yes. But look at all the fun you had.  Mind if I try?
You're such a smart aleck! Nobody can do anything but you. I'll show you how to stop a car—and I won't use my thumb.
You might give me a little credit.
Mind your own business.
I proved once and for all that the limb is mightier than the thumb.
You know.
No!  No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
No, I'm sorry.  No, I didn't mean that.  No, I didn't mean that.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
You're cold?
You shouldn't have brought me here, you know.
You could have looked in my car. Oh, but you didn't know my car, did you?
Lucky for me you were wandering about. Thank you again. I've been terrible bother to you.
When you...  There were pins in my hair...
No, you are right,  I'm glad you didn't take me home... I wouldn't have known you, to thank you...  Oh, but I don't know you! And you don't know me! My name is Madeleine Elster.
So. Not bored yet?
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
How did you know that?
Rosa, I can't believe you're doing all this for me... thank you.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
What... What are you talking about?
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Create a little drama?  Start a new rumor?  What?
I know. The one who phoned. Your old college chum, Elster.
I wouldn't know.  What kind of wife are you looking for?
What? What've I done?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Why not?
You'll hate me now, won't you?
I should be so lucky.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
I guess so.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Craobhan-geanmchno...  How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
I am told so.
I told you a liter was less than a gallon.
The book said they have a lot of rail strikes in Italy.
Couldn't we just have taken a train?
So.  How do we get to Rome?
Father Barry.
You didn't answer my question.
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
I know you can.  But I'd like to.
Can you recommend a restaurant?
He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique.
Take care of her. She's a keeper.
And a leader. Didn't she meet Castro on foreign exchange?
Oh, baby, I can't believe you're back.
Me either.
You've been the man in mine.
Except for the hot affairs we'll have twice a year.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
No last names, Jonah.  Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers.  How come you're up so late?
You don't like the one he was now?
Got me there.  What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Where's your mom?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
remember distinctly Father taking me for a "piggy-back" ride—
Of course it is.
No.
I'm following you.
Slapped her around a little. Punched her in the stomch. It was pretty scary.
What?
I don't.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment...  Go ahead.
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yeah, like that.
Oh God, how horrid.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't want to stop.
I stood alone on the green, searching for something, and I started to walk to the church. But then the darkness closed in, I was alone in the dark, being pulled into darkness, and I fought to wake up...
Why don't you talk to him now?
Not even if they're a dork.  You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him.  He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
No one called it a war!
You didn't deserve me John Buckingham.
Something else.
Goodbye.
I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
He's very... clean.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
I didn’t say he was worth it.
What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour?
I'm a little embarrassed. I'm not used to losing control with such -- volume.
What is it Miles?
Huh?
Did you just propose to me?
Yes.
Oh, gosh.
April?
Yes, I guess.  Yes.
Let's stay here, Will.
No. Why?
Come on, Will.
Request; comprehensive electrical systems check.
Now's not really the time to get into this --
Don't do this to yourself.  Jerry. You don't love me.
Holes?  I don't know what you're talking about.
Answer me.  Was the first time you saw me the first time I saw you? Was it?  You've been following me around.  Do you see how that could be disconcerting to me?  That's not love, Jerry.  It's obsession. And it isn't normal and you can't expect me to respond to it and you can't expect me to feel the same way.  Can you?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost $150 at the Free Clinic.
We've got to get an abortion?
Half. Okay?  Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I don't know...
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I'll miss you, Mike.
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all.  I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks.  I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
You are such a sweetheart.
You spent it on drugs, didn't you?
... maybe it's congratulations.
Michael? What ha...
"Mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."
...What?
Yeh -- unfortunately, things are going to be pretty busy, but... okay, let's give it a try.  Four o'clock could be good.
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
It's not true, but it feels true.
What was that about up there?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
No, there's nothing you have to say to me. I'm getting out, Scottie. For good. I can't stay here. I'm winding up her affairs, and mine. I'm going to get as far away as I can. Probably Europe. And I'll probably never come back.  Good-bye, Scottie. If there's anything I can do for you before I go...
Mmm...
You're a sweet man, Richard.
Oh my God... Ted.  What are you...? I can't believe this. I haven't seen you since --
Who's that?
Why are you doing this to me?
Mm-hm.
Grandma made me the cutest outfit.  I can't wait to show it to you.
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
I love the way she writes.
Me? Oh, uh.  No.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
I'm not interested yet.
When did you get back?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
No... No. It is just the English way.
I know about you.
I'm sorry.  I didn't mean anything.
No--I'm furious!--Nobody seems to do anything about it--
So who left who?
Eventually.  We were going to be  engaged... when you came back from  overseas...
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
No.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Yes, thank you.  Intravenous if possible.
Bullshit.
I'm very tired, George.
And when are you going to realize, Ted, that your mental hygiene is the most important thing right now.
Eat this spaghetti, Ted.  It'll make you feel a lot better.
Who's that, Ted?
It's Jules, you guys haven't had a call from, say, Kimberly, have you?
... me, yeah.  And she likes Tommy Lasorda.  Case closed.
Nya-nya-nya!
What are you up to?
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
I forgot all about Aaron.  I promised to stop by and see how he did.
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure?  We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
No.  I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
What does Charlie think about that?
Do you like pigeons?
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What's that?
What?
Now isn't that just too cute? There's a brain behind that face of yours, isn't there? You've got everything nicely figured out, for yourself, including this.
I thought so, too.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Oh...ungghhhhh!
Oh Kevin -- don't stop!
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
No!
So what do you want to see?
Yes, Doctor.
Dr. Hirsch, Mr. Kessler cried out a minute ago.
Dr. Hirsch?
I'll go.
HELP! HELP!!
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Leon hung himself...
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about...  Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What's the matter with him?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
I didn't see it.
You say you perform in the Miami area?
Ted, are you okay?
But it is what I want.
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
Ok, I will... later.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Egypt?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Why?
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Whatever you're having.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
It's Charlie!
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
Maybe if I kiss him I'll feel it.
Or maybe it'll turn him back into a toad.
Maybe I can change him.
I thought this was supposed to be the one guy in the world you wouldn't need to change.
Sightseeing...  What're you doing?
I don't think you're very polite.
If I didn't know you, Glenn, by tomorrow you'd be in jail or dead.  Look at it that way.  Go on.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Yeah.  Uh, well, sure we did.  An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah.  Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in.  I was very weak.  So were you.  Now I've met someone else.
I paid for it and everything.
I've got to be honest with you.  I met someone else.  I've met someone else.  I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Oh.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
No.  I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Not the other way around...?
Oh, I do want to know.  I tried to reach you at the precinct.
No.
How about over here?
That little prick.
He's funny--maybe you can use him in the show, Mr. Denby.
That little prick.
Oh Miles!
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium.  Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me...  ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have...  One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars.  But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave?  I'm pregnant.
Yes, isn't it wonderful?  I'm so happy.  I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Yes, you are,  When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
No!
I thought I was the pro.  These women make me feel like an amateur.
I want you desperately!
I want to be had.
He won't make love to me anymore.
He' s confused--
Don't you think I'm pretty?
It's been fun thinking about the money but I can walk away from it, honey.
Was that who I thought it was?
Has this happened to you before?
Mr. Kessler?
Thank you.
You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
You don't even know me.
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Sure, sure.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
Oh shit.
And then one night -- at the gaming tables -- well I just saw him. A stranger -- looking at me -- and I knew suddenly that all my life I'd been --
I'm getting married tomorrow.
He'll not flee if I show myself?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour.  When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
Make love to me.
Everybody that I care about dies.
No, she didn't... she never got jealous before... she got excited.  I don't have luck with women. There was this girl I met while I was in college.  I slept with her once.  She started following me around, taking my picture.  She dyed her hair, copied my clothes. Lisa something... Oberman.  It was awful.
For what... to set me up?  She loved me she wouldn't frame me.
I never have before.
Why is Cole here?
Why are you stopping?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Fine.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
Quickly, please... tell me one of your funny stories.
Thanks.
No.
Because he called me.
Would you get that, dear?
Well, I told him I wouldn't - uh - go there any more.  I know it's tough to understand, but it wasn't easy. You see, he was nice to me. I mean, it wasn't just him. I got something out of it too I guess. Anyway, I told him I wouldn't go there anymore.
I was pretty hard on her last night.  And now she’s getting married.
Is that all you have to say?
Thank you.
Fill for a second.
I sort of wanted to wait to see if maybe he'd notice me first?
You're right.  At least that way you could spend the rest of your life blaming your parents instead of yourself.  Smile.
I'll call an ambulance.
For all the really important things--
Yes! And he would have a little more time for--
So he wouldn't be confined so much to his office--
Very well, madame. Thank you.
Oh, no, no, no, no, my dear child! That's ridiculous. You go home as usual--five o'clock every day. Now I'm going to be a little bit of a tyrant--I insist. It'll be nice for your little brother, too. <u>Five</u> <u>o'clock</u>--remember!
I'll do my best, madame, even if I have to work every night.
Right!
That's really cool.
Is that your camper?
She's shy.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100% real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
What! How do you know?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
No.
It never came up.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Dr. Homer Wells.
I am Nina Ivanovna Yakushova, Envoy Extraordinary, acting under direct orders of Comrade Commissar Razinin. Present me to your colleagues.
I am looking for Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Why not?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Do I have to?
You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand.
-- Then you don't need me.
... So am I.
I want my fucking money --
It's my paycheck.  Which I earned.  Which I deserve.  Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Fuck you.  Make time.  Cause I bust my ass for you.  I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you.  And what do you do for me?  Huh?  You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once?  Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing?  Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
Don't ever stop fucking me!
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too.  So I went and asked.
Uh-huh.  Spent the last few days knocking on doors.  And you know what?  They're not.  I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff.  And their pets are fine.  So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Interesting.
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's wrong with you?
Well, well.  Ho, ho, ho.  You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that?  Take a breath.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
You're acting like a crazy person.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
You mean that girl, don't you?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Told you I was nice.  I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Why not?
He do that every year?
The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind.  May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
Peter?  Peter was a mistake.  An imposter.
Way to hoop.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
It was a ouija board, remember?
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Kinda like men.
Just what you underlined.
Over this?
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
A time will come when you'll thank me for this.
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Hi, Mark.
Our salute will be a kiss.
...and we won't clench our fist...
And we won't stretch up our arms...
No, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.
I am so happy. No one can be so happy without being punished. I will be punished and I should be punished.  I want to confess, darling.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Hi.
Need any help?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I can't wait any longer.  Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
That's nothing.  I saw him myself.
Uh, Kimmy...?
We settled this.  And I reneged. That wasn't fair.
Yeah.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
It’s complicated, Dad.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
Why?
No. You know too many sick ladies.
...just for a second.  So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
Didn't Charles have any friends?
At least he knows how to behave at funerals.
Have you no idea who could have done it?
You okay?
There are two important psychic conduits called the "pingala" and the "ida".  The pingala starts with the left testicle  and ends at the right nostril.
The right nostril.  Good.
Just do what I say.  Now, which nostril are you breathing through?
That's not necessary, Jackson---  Okay, Nuke, now lean in for the sign.
The ida originates at the right testicle and terminates at the left nostril.
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught.  They see you, they see dollar signs.
Do you think I did it?
Are you going to represent me?
You must have some feeling.  Some immediate impression.  A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will.  And the things that went on in that house.  Such wild sex.  What kind of picture does that paint?
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What other issue is there, Sid?
Uh-huh.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
I'll be all right.  Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back.  I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism.  I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
I hope you're not comparing yourself to Napoleon. He was a strategist. Your idea of strategy is to use a lead pipe.
We leave Miami in an hour. Soon's we get some supplies aboard.
South America.
South America!
He's a director.
-- what guy?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
Never mind.
That's just why I'm going.
No.
I trust you.
You might do that.  Get me a ticket for...  No, you don't!
I forgot my bag.
Don't worry about it.  I thought the apricot and honey business was the real lowpoint.
Did she ever see Vada?
What happened to her?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Are you mad at me?
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
For how long?
Yes I know, it runs in the family.  New book?
They're enormous, I know.
Oh yeah?
Terrible! Nothing terrible about her. She's great! Marvelous youngster! Got a mind of her own. Knows just what she wants.  She's not going to get it though. She won't get very far. Has no money.
Holy Smoke! I forgot all about that.  Send a wireless at once, "Lovington Detective Agency. Daughter escaped again. Watch all roads—all transports and railroad stations in Miami. Have your New York office keep tabs on King Westley. Intercept all messages. Want her back at all costs!"
Actually, I don't...
I'm impressed. Can't spot a thing.
I'm just curious what sort of security system you'd have in your own house.
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away.  So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free.  Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't.  She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
Did you like making love to me?
I suppose they are in the truck. Are you going to take a lot of time with this?
Where are you going?
What's the problem?
I finally found my story.
Well, what is it, honey?
Okay.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Where are the antihistamines?
Get a garter belt...  Get a garter belt and flirt.
Like how?
I should get a garter belt.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
God.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
She really does, though.
Did something happen to make you care about reality?
You have one?
I -- I -- I...
Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way.
You think so?
That's it?
I'm sure.
Oh, hi!  Did you find her all right?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough.  Just as I could live yours!
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
... Least of all my son.  It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
Okay. That's bad.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
We'll never survive.
It reminds me of this one time --  Hey, can I ask you a question?  How come you don't have any stories?  I've got lots of stories, and you don't have any.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It's not really important.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Alright, I said I was sorry.  Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Why are you being so dramatic?
What is that sup...
All of a sudden, I'm supposed to drop out of school, forget my family, forget my career, forget all the plans I had for my life...
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Did you go riding?
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
Aren't the roses beautiful?
How d'you mean?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
Jack...can we afford all this?
How do you even know about this place?
What if they serve soup?
You'll do it?
You -- you!!
No.  I better be going.  Thanks for your help.
Jill.
-- there's not much room --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
We don't think marriage is important.
About forever.
I can give you one thing: he was in love with her.
What if I say no?
I'll give you another complication: he still is.
Oh I don't think so.
Why?... Why should you carry other people's bags?
Why?
That's no business... that's a social injustice.
I don't know.  But you do.
Yes. Yes.
No, no, please God, you're wrong. I'm a thief. Just like you.
Four shootings in five years.  All accidents.
Noah was my counselor in my freshman year.  That's probably where I got the idea for the icepick.  For my book. Funny how the subconscious works.  Hazel is my friend.
The big job.
What is it with this?  They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here!  He has no time!
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us?  She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing!  What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there!  He's not there!  And when he is, he isn't!  So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George.  I'll stop coming.  But it won't be because of Peter.  It'll be because you asked me to stop.  Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
-- Yeah, honey...
Why don't you stay and watch the fun? You'll enjoy it immensely.
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house?  Oh, it's you.
No.
You don't know anything about me.
We tried it. It didn't suit me.
Clean the slut up, take her out, huh?!  What are you trying to prove!?  I'm not a piece of meat for you to offer to your friends!
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob.  It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I don't care.
No.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, yes.
A thousand marks --
Well, he's a gentleman!
Look, it's just an evening at the opera.  Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
I know.  I said that, but...  he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it.  He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Will you take some advice?  If you're looking for romance--count me out--  --if you know what's good for you.
I was in here yesterday.
To the church, I must go there.
Please let me go.
Let me go! Let me go!!
You believe that I love you?
Who do you think I was talking to?
No!!! Stay away from me!
What are we having?
No. As far as they're concerned the only good Rick is a dead Rick. But I don't care... it's my decision.
Will! What--?
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
Oh, I suppose so.
Why did he shoot her?
What?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Oh! Yes. Hello.
I... suddenly felt such a fool.
Oh, yes. Fine. No after effects.  But as I remember now, that water was cold, wasn't it?  What a terrible thing to do... and you were so kind...  It's a formal thank-you letter. And a great big apology.
I enjoyed talking to you.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Do you swear you didn't know?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
I’m impressed. That information could have cost me £20,000.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Still the man.
Is this true, Stewart? Did you really say it?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Joe, I'm with Drew.
Why, you sweet thing, you. Where'd you get it pressed?
Thanks, Steve.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
Could you?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Mom?
I don't know...  More like when I kissed Sam.
It's not what I was expecting.
Well, what is your definition of following?
You followed me!
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
It's really cold.
No.
I was here six years.  And I only hated two.
Good night.
No thanks.
I wanna go home.
Does that mean that you want me to go there?
Then you don't want me to go there.
I see a house that looks like any other house. What's remarkable about it?
So that is your house?
Then why don't we go?  You might be an interesting subject of study.
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh. I forgot.
What's up?
They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back!
"Fun?"  Jesus, "<u>fun</u>?"  I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
What's going on?  What are you doing?
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
And I don't even know your full name.
What'll it be like in California, Sailor, do you think? I hear it don't rain much there.
I suppose so. She knew I was bound to see you soon as you was sprung, but I don't figure she counted on us takin' off together like this... I guess this means you're breakin' parole, then?
It ain't. It's part of the lessons of life. I picked me up a pack of Vantages before we left the Cape?
We got through two states already.
Yeah, I guess, but - and here's the lesson part - they ain't supposed to be so bad for you.
Pop, I got news.
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said:  'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
Learning language.
What is... Make Love?
What's that then?
Is it because I'm here?
I want to ask you a question.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
Aw, now, don't you start telling me I shouldn't dunk.
Yeah?  Who is this?
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Sure.
How'd it go today?
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss?  Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I dunno..
What does that mean?
What about them?
It's a beautiful picture of her.
Amen to that.  The supermarket's full of assholes.
Too kinky.
Quit.
Is that one of your poems?
What?
Mike?
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Don't you like me, Ben?
When is that?
When?
Bye.
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
He could let you have your vacation.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
A whole ten cents?!
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ...   and John's using hair products... I don't know who I—.
Oh, my God!
What's the difference?
You mean, you knew about me?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
What?
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
And the last thing she'd leave behind would be her wedding ring!  Do you ever leave yours at home?
Climax together.
Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me.
All right, darling.
Soon, you'll have your own rage!
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Excuse me?
Well, good, Ed.  I like working with you too.
Then don't be smart.
Yup.
Oh my God.  Oh my God.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
I can put them in a good school.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars.
I don't even know how much money that is.
I was going to ring... but... I didn't think you'd want to...
It's just another case, Sailor.
One person thinks he's doin' somethin' good and ever'body else gets upset about it.
Hi.
Mama mia.  Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
Do you <u>have</u> an Agent Lowry in your New York office?
Yes.
He went out and bought himself men's cologne the other day.  Did I tell you that?
Larry bought himself cologne?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
That's the influence of the right food, the right exercise, and the right breathing.  Greet the dawn with the Breath of Fire!  Of course, there's no doubt the body is giving out. I'm well into autumn. I'll have to be giving it all up after Saturday. Sweeten the tea with honey, Harold. It's delicious.
Me. Ha! Did I tell you I'll be eighty on Saturday?
Wonderful! Try something new each day. After all, we're given life to find it out. It doesn't last forever.
Here we are, Harold. Oat straw tea and ginger pie.
Right back to you.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself.  I feel like a little solitude.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here.  I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
Uh huh.
I just can.
No.
That's all I wanted to know.
You're good.
Thank you.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Get up!?
I don't like her.
I don't remember.
Did I scowl at you?
Well, let me see... they tore down the George Orwell monument and put up a bust of George Michael. Main Street's a four-laner, no left turns four to seven. I was married and divorced. And Grosse Pointe is now officially the new sister city to Lower Hutt, New Zealand. We have fiber-optic town meetings every two months.
Wait a minute! You're not a detective any more. What's going on?
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
Pop Leibel.
You practically bribed him with your erector set.
If what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.
It's none of your business.
Look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.
I don't want to talk about him.
Carlos had some great rock.
Then what do you think?
I am not!
Will I like it?
But I always eat like this.
Hell no, baby... I wouldn'ta done that without tellin' you.
Who?... Uncle Pooch?...
Johnnie... That's the past... We gotta get on to our future, sugar!
Let's head for Texas and see if we can pick up the trail.
This 'bout the fifth time?
The wind will be with us!  Do as I say.
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
What?
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
When you know how to make love, you'll know how to pitch.  Shh.  I love this part.
No, no, no.  Put it back on and take it off slowly.
You think Dwight Gooden leaves his socks on?
No, no, honey...  first the shoes and socks.
Did Mr. Doyle think I stole this case.
Jeff -- if anybody walked in here, I don't think they'd believe what they see.
You and me with long faces -- plunged into despair -- because we find out that a man didn't kill his wife. We're two of the most frightening ghouls I've ever known.
Whatever happened to that old saying "Love Thy Neighbor."
Damn it! You can’t fucking walk away from this!
Steady Marlon!
Goodbye!  See you!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
A new disease.
Don't bother.
Great.
You want me to dress like her?
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I understand.  That's very kind of you.
There's a light up ahead.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
What?
Yeah.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again.  This was really nice of you.
Okay?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
--Torn down in the name of convenience--
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Solid and genuine is not boring. Michael can be completely insane...
Is this what you mean, M'sieu Laval?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It's my mother.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What?
What?
Nothing? You don't even lock the door?
Is that true?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Who is it?
What did you stop it for?
Oh, no, I have a car.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
Just a romantic, that's you.
Why--don't you like him?
Isn't he a salesman?
Flashlights. Luminous dials for watches. House numbers that light up.
His personal effects. He's probably running away -- the coward.
But it takes a particularly low type of man to do it.
What about this morning? Any developments?
In this heat?  They're up now.
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
I didn't wait long.  One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
...I’m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that’s who I am. Do you get what I’m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere.  Not a chance.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You're a fag or a liar.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Hi, Dusty.
What's a prom?
You didn't show it to anybody?
All 900.
Getting loud, getting loud.
Yes! Now it's your turn! I learned your language, you have to learn mine!
So -- Mag -- you've seen this, huh?
Yes, I've seen it.  And I have to say it's the rudest and most offensive... joke anybody's ever played on me!
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're butting in.
Eli, John is a carpenter.  As well as being a fine policeman.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is...  I love you... Robert.
No.  Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You weren't.  Thanks.  How does it feel being here?
Used to what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
What about the plane?
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition.  He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
But I thought high school is only four years.
What year are you in?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I have his journal.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is.  From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
Hmmm.
