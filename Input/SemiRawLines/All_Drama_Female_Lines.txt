It won't play.
I had nothing to do with that fire.
A new magazine! I never saw it before.
Oh.
No.
No. I baked them for you.
No. I baked them for you.
It's getting cold.
Are you?
Please don't play governess, Karen, I haven't your unyielding good taste, I wish I'd gone to Radcliffe too but father wouldn't hear of it - he needed help at the notions counter... I'm being rude now, aren't I? OR should I say "ain't I"?
I know you can do it without sedation, You can, I know you can.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Oh yes, my watch. I almost forgot.
That's a big help. Where are you from?
I baked you my oatmeal cookies.
Not what. Who. What is for things. What? What? What? What? For people you use who. Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I?
Who are you?
I am Jenny Haydn.
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
So you agree you need help?
Why?
Yes. It was, actually.
Like me.
'HE'? Whom do you mean-
What's the matter?
Take...take a year. Take six months. Whatever you want. Who knows? Maybe you'll, maybe you'll be sitting with a good play.
Good.
Look. Listen. Listen. You want to write? Write.
No. No, it don't. I can't do that. I can't let m'self. All I can do is see how soon they gonna wanta eat again. They'd all get upset if I done anymore 'n that. They all depen' on me jus' thinkin' about that. That's my part--that an' keepin' the fambly together.
That's a fairly crummy way to start a morning.
Maybe I would if I knew when you were coming back.
No, there's...
You know, if you let me come over to your place once in a while, you could put on a clean shirt in the morning.
Sure. Monday and Thursday -- and Monday again -- and Thursday again --
You have to go. I mean it.
I know. Lenny, if Tran finds you talking to me he'll hurt you.
"You'll be burned out Or smoked out An' come back to me, I know..."
"Every trail that you blaze Makes me..."
Well, thank you very much. You can go now.
Why you?
And I'm asking you -
No, he doesn't. And I don't want you here. Just go, please.
Breakfast?
I was the Yoni Yum feminine-hygiene Dew girl from 1965 to 1970, but got laid off.
Going north?
I was a successful model once.
American Cheese. The king of road food.
Well, I got homework.
I don't know.
Something mi trabajo.
Spanish.
I think, therefore I am.
Yes. Is this David?
Please...
I know I must have had something to do with the palace - I've had little flashes of things - but being the Princess? It doesn't matter as long as I find my home.
Just a minute, you!
Get out!
You are! Writing words, words! You've made a rope of words and strangled this businessl But there is a microphone right there to catch the last gurgles, and Technicolor to photograph the red, swollen tongue!
It's so beautiful ... and sad.
Lost. it feels lost. This was hers?
Oh yeah. The best. Josie takes in the spectacle around her.
Yes.
Oh, it wasn't all that bad, darling. We were fortunate that Mr. Gardiner turned out to be so reasonable.
Do you feel well enough for that?
Hah!... Tell me the truth, Eve - if I wait until I feel better, will I ever meet the man?
I love Jewish men.
So why did y...
I have an appointment this after- noon. I need someone to take them to the park.
I'm already on thin ice. Yesterday, I actually thought my boss was going to fire me.
Bandaids for cuts. Bandaids for new shoe blisters. Packet of Wash n Dri's. Kleenex. Sugar free lollipops, potty seat covers for public restrooms...
Fine, forget it.
Turned out Edna. had one last trick up her sleeve. INT. FENDER COMPOUND -- KITCHEN -- TEN MINUTES AGO
Mescaline. INT. CAST WINNEBAGO -- NIGHT Domino and the others are all drinking coffee. Alf stares out through the windshield at the GLOW of Vegas in the distance.
What's wrong, Norman?
Just don't... I've got a headache.
You all set here?
I don't laugh at you, George. I like you. I like you because you will never, ever make it as an aristocrat... and that's because you're completely incompetent at hiding your feelings.
And to think I am teaching you to become one of them...
Is it? Well, I'm scared of what we've become in our freedom.
Do you? When I saw those men yesterday in the field... and the women and children in those hovels? I'm not so sure if America is as far from England as I'd hoped.
No. But someone you can talk to.
You'll see.
Your Eames table is incredible. And the B B. I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red.
I can extend that. There's some storage tanks outboard on the wrecked module. I'll have to go outside to tie onto them.
Brace yourself. We've got about 12 hours worth if we close off the sections we're not using.
I can get power to this module and sub-bay if I remote these busses. I've gotta get past the mains, which are a total melt-down.
It was... stupid really. I was leaning over and I slipped.
Because, I don't know, because sometimes...sometimes I forget things...and ever since Caitlin left, ever since my daughter left for school, there've been...I fainted and... Why is this so hard?
I know.
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you one day, and then I didn't, like, marry you?
Forget it, Bleek. Take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom. I'm sure you guys will have a really bitchin' time!
I still have your virginity!
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?
Well at least you don't have to walk around with the evidence under your sweater. I'm a planet!
This is a grotesque violation of this man's personal life, but never mind --
What're you doing down here?
That day you came over to my place to play doctor... what was going on there?
Nothing at all?
I can call them... I can call my dad.
Louis, look at me.
I did it for us, Louis. So we could be free.
Well, uh... I'm an expert-about stuff like this -- she was totally for real!
Seymour! I promise you that wasn't a joke -- you have to call her back!
That didn't sound like a joke to me... what, did you write a personal ad or something?
Wow! What was that all about?
I can't bear it when you do - I would die rather than lose you Louis. I would die the way he died.
Oh, thanks.
That bad, huh?
Because I'm getting fat.
Oh, for Heaven's sake.
I thought you said he was Peruvian?
I can't say.
Why?
Yes.
Who?
No.
Who?
She'd punish me.
One of the other Sisters?
But how do you know if the people are guilty ?
Mr. Crabtree was saying how George Sanders killed himself, only he couldn't remember how.
James'll know about George Sanders.
Just a few then. The big ones.
I loved it blond.
You're shaking. What is it?
Poor baby. This'll relax you.
What's the time?
How did it go?
Come on.
Really?
Karen, in all the years of our friendship, I have never let you go to the Ladies' Room alone. But now I must. I am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...
The moon?
I have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.
At the end of the yeat the person who got the most direct his to my head got to toss me into the pool.
I believe in miracles now.
And I don't fall in love with grown men who collect baseball cards!!
In the first place, I don't fall in love with weirdos I've only known for four or five days.
What?! Now hold on! Wait one damn minute!
To bed?
Listen to me. Your mother must never know. Never.
I do like him. I can't stop thinking about him.
Cecile, we just made out in the middle of Central Park. You can trust me.
I don't know.
I want you to make me copies of his letters and bring them to me.
Yes. They're in this antique doll house in my room.
Or pee in their pants when they see the ocean!
I didn't say that.
Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
They sent me off to the Bahamas "for the good of my health." They sent me to the Bay of bloody Islands "for the good of my health."
I did exactly what you told me. I went to Dodd and I said that I didn't have Jimmy's money, or any drugs, that this Teddy must have taken everything.
Well... G'bye.
Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
Yes -- 'Hildy, darling'. I'm just a fool. That's what I am. I know what it's going to be like.
But what's our relationship? Are we good friends, or is she just a casual acquaintance?
We're goin' to California, ain't we? Awright then, let's go to California.
I never had my house pushed over before. I never had my fambly stuck out on the road. I never had to lose... ever'thing I had in life.
I don't think I belong here.
What do you think?
That's a lie! They still want me!
Get up!!
More than all right. Miss Bodwin, she teach me stuff..Book stuff. She says I might go to Oberlin. She's experimenting on me.
Don't pay to complain.
No. Got me an afternoon job at the shirt factory. Figure between that and my night work at the Bodwins I might be able to put something away for me and mama.
I just wanted to find out what was going on...But now that I'm here it seems strange, doesn't it?
Is that true?
See if you can guess.
Think real hard, Benjamin.
Don't tell Elaine.
Are you shocked?
All right. Now let's get to bed.
Yes.
Yeah, my grammy.
Yes.
Yes.
Uh-huh.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
Will you come with me, please.
Beats me. Ask your mom.
Oh, my God.
Anyway. He walks up to her on lunch yard today. And tells her... publicly...that they're 'breaking up.'
She's devastated.
Right. Which is the whole point of this 'going out' thing, so one of them can dump the other one, and they can imitate the whole passionate adult soap opera tragedy, without ever having to actually date.
Doesn't begin to describe it. I mean, you've got cancer, this is serious.
And you said...?
You're kidding.
Why don't you come down to LA? Stay with us for a while.
That's why he has the parties, he says it's like bringing the world to me.
It's not so bad here. After all, what girl doesn't want to live in a castle?
With about twenty of his spies on my tail. No thanks.
Yeah, Orson's a real piece of work. But deep down, he's a good kid. Real deep down.
Mr. Welles certainly is a caution
Mm.
And attractive in a hammy sort of way.
I can't
Listen, you come down and stay with us for a few days. Just tell the old man that--
Very good.
Oh, thank God.
Just hurry.
I've been wrong a lot in my life.
I know where he goes.
What'd you feel when you kissed him?
Nick, what happened --
That goddam diamond stud earring that cost me a fucking fortune.
Lose something?
Will you stop? Jesus.
What's wrong with that?
A card? For her fiftieth birthday?
Well...wow...
Mac? Oh there you are. What are you doing, honey? No more work. Don't you feel breezy.
You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do.
It's always not this time. If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone.
How nice for everybody. Come swimming. The water's glorious. You'll fix it. You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas.
Typical male.
It's only a b-b-b-book...
She's watching the car again?
Yes.
YOU KNOW WHO I AM.
What is it, Patrick? Are you alright?
Patrick? I can't hear you.
Where are you? Patrick, what's wrong?
Why?
...it's my problem, too.
M'hm.
And then I remembered when I was a kid how I accidentally saw my parents making love.
Well, she said that I was very guilty about my impulses toward marriage, and-and children.
M'hm.
And then she mentioned penis envy... Did you know about that?
I was just thinking out loud... I mean, you've got this whole thing with Dana -- I'm not going to let you fuck that up...
Yeah, well... me neither...
No... forget it...
What?... Maybe... no... I dunno...
Shhh... I really need to get some sleep.
But I'm concerned with everything, Mr. Bebe.
Thanks. So do you.
Oh.
What happened?
How horrible.
Look at this one "Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other." "All that's missing is your bastard."
There's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. Free for the hauling! We should put it in Bleeker's yard.
Maybe they'll totally shit and be super mad at you and not let you graduate or go to Cabo San Lucas for spring break.
Bleeker and I were going to go to Gettysburg for spring break.
Well, maybe you could look at one of those adoption ads. I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.
There are ads? For parents?
Oh yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn." They're right by the ads for like, iguanas and terriers and used fitness equipment. It's totally legit.
Come on, Leah. I can't scope out wannabe parents in the Penny Saver! That's tacky. That's like buying clothes at the Pump n' Munch.
The Penny Saver sucks.
Yeah, but it sucks for free.
Wasn't it lovely?
That's where it gets a little strange.
I was offered that job as a waitress.
I thought someone was following me - I - er - I just needed my computer and some things...Listen, I'd like to work from home for a few weeks - is that OK?
Dad, are you okay in there?
What was it, Mr. Hillyer?
You've been married twice --
Oh, Wade.
Alright. I'll think about it.
You see, I am writing this article for CHIC MAGAZINE
LESLIE? Is that good enough?
I am sorry...
That's five. So. Why did you decide to deejay again?
Fine. That's great.
Well, I wouldn't mind a quick chat, if you got the time.
Well if one of them is this "Sin City" thing --
Look if you can't think of anything, it doesn't matter. I'll do one. My five favorite from the old days at the Dodger.
Okay, okay.
You're using this conspiracy theory as an excuse to avoid sex with me.
Why do you ask?
And so I always manage to, do you see? Like the book script thing, do you see?
No. Ain't ever gonna be scared no more. I was, though. For a while I thought we was beat-- good an' beat. Looked like we didn't have nothin' in the worl' but enemies--wasn't no body frien'ly anymore. It made me feel bad an' scared too--like we was lost... an' nobody cared.
You manage to throw me off balance. I adore you.
Incidentally, 'Joe' what?
Nnnnn. I just killed the surprise.
I think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.
Oh tsht. Yes.
-- the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" --
Yes, I do.
Go home now.
I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you.
I won't let you have it.
Well -- I think you might consider
...It's really a fine opportunity for me. But I'm not sure I want to be a department head. It's mostly executive and administrative work. Well, anyway, I told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...
He's turning blue!
You're a writer, you said.
I'm afraid of being lonely.
What?
It was a long time ago -
That's not all, Nicky. I've been backing your plays for fifteen years. And I've never been more depressed.
They're watching him closely. There's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. To bolster his confidence. And that's not all.
Ever since he started reviewing the Broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.
Steven Schwimmer. The most powerful critic in America gets his first crack at Nicky Rogan.
But not you.
Who was the other man?
Like seeing the good side of Rachel. So she'll see the good side of us.
Are you or aren't you?
Oh, no, it's not. I mean, they're not all totally in a coma. I mean, they know when I'm helping them.
Right now?
You're kidding? My God. What is it?
Oh, it's so soft.
Oh...
So, do you think it's too much if I wear these in the same day?
...Thank you.
The very fact that they're authorities should give you reason. People will do anything to protect their own interests. For all you know he was killed at the hands of the police.
Alice an' Silky gave them... free ones.
What's your name anyway?
You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
Are you really going to kill them?
Fartsbishop!
It's okay.
If you're here.
Do you want to stay here?
It's like strip poker, only, without the bluffing. One person says something and if the other one accepts that it's true, the one who says it, gets to take one item of clothing off.
It's alright. Be our guests.
What do you expect me to do? What in the world -
No.
I've been to a few -- yes.
I've tried it.
It's...
Should I... should I tell you why?
How was it?
To death?
Yes... that should do it. What am I? A luxury?
How long's it gonna take, for you to drink yourself to death?
It's so unfair.
I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you. Is this somehow related to the fire department?
Okay. But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct?
Do you have the suspect in custody?
Alright, cut, cut, cut.
Eddie, are you okay?
They don't have to be in the office Christmas show?
Nothing sweetheart.
Annabelle...wake up honey...
Mom? What's wrong?
You've done five of my ideas.
Spence.
But I'm the one up there on the screen.
Reasonable? Good, I'd like to meet a reasonable man. Why don't you ask this Gardiner to join us for dinner?
Of course I do? Bring them up!
So maybe Dr. Becker would know. But, as I'm sure you know, the statute of limitations has run out for charging the hospital with any liabilities.
How do you know about Dr. Becker?
I was. But I saw a lot of cuts and a lot of blows. I'm sorry I don't know more about your father's. I didn't know about everything that went on here.
My names isn't ANGELA...
What's with all the locks - and hammering
Of course I do!
Um-hm.
Sexual politics, racism, the environment, the military industrial...
About things that are important to me.
God, KAREN JOHNSON.
I pay his stipend every month, far more dutifully than I should.
Wow!
How much is it?
Is this one any good?
Sure!... Wait, maybe not 78s, but I can play regular records...
Sure, I guess.
Whatcha doin'?
George.
I'm sorry.
In my handbag.
I can't go out there. How can I go out there?
The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
Yes.
I already said hello.
Fuck you, Joel. Faggot.
Oh Christ I didn't kill anybody. It's just a fucking dent. You're like some old lady or something.
A wino? Jesus, Are you from the fifties? A wino! Face it, Joel. You're freaked out because I was out late without you, and in your little wormy brain, you're trying to figure out, did she fuck someone tonight?
I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal.
Like?
Then, you kiss his ass.
But . . . we can' t Jack, I need time to collect artifacts ... make sketches ... gather evidential information.
Matzoh! Are you Jewish?
You decided to help me. Trust yourself. Trust your own judgment. You can question everything, you can never know anything for sure.
You know...Where's your bathroom?
That's crazy -- why not?
Perhaps because you've always been a part of Shangri-La without knowing it.
However many. It's not enough.
Well, I was gonna head over to the Browns now. I was thinking -- Mandy really values your opinion ...
What time is it?
No, I need my car --
Some men get the world. Others get ex-hookers and a trip to Arizona.
You wouldn't have done anything like that, shot someone for money.
The Mafia hire Jack Hewitt?
Jack wouldn't kill for it. Besides, who would pay him?
Jack doesn't need money.
But not now.
No. Don't do this.
Robert, if that happens, you'll have to decide. I won't be able to.
Maybe it does. Don't patronize me Gordon.
No -- only occasional jobs.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Twenty thousand dollars.
I'll act surprised.
That aside for the moment, I'm struck by the tenor, the ill-spirit of your report... the degrading remarks by other aviators... innuendo about her performance in unrelated situations... even a reference to her sexual activity the weekend prior. In my seven years on this committee, I've never seen a downed aviator treated like this. Never. I'm deeply disturbed by this report, Mr. Hayes. Not just what it bodes for women in the military -- but for your own confirmation as well.
I'd like to think our next Secretary of the Navy would be prepared for anything, Mr. Hayes.
Your wife?
Well, quick -- get into bed. Are you all right?
So you like me, huh?
Anita, remember espadrilles?
My husband will be back quite late.
No.
Sit down, Benjamin.
Did you know that?
The fireworks are about to start.
Let's go take a look at that trooper.
So he said it quite a few years ago. So what? I never looked better in my life. Do you know why? Because I've never been as happy in my life.
No thanks.
I don't believe you.
No.
Benjamin -- this is my mother!
Don't tell me --
Please let me go.
Then you took her upstairs and you raped her.
Somebody called--something about an electronics store.
Can't you see it?
I'm okay. I just - You just have to understand. I've been with Lester since I was a kid. I just wanted to say goodbye. I - I just... I don't... I think I have a right to do that. Okay?
Yeah.
I'm not crying.
Yeah.
No matter how often I see guns, I still can't get used to them.
Bully? Are we talking about Gary Boyd? Or your dad.
But he's not quite the same guy anymore. Don't get your hopes too high?
Then you've gotta ask him about that.
It's important.
Promise?
Mr. Boone. He is an interesting friend.
I know you're her bodyguard. Did she buy it or did you?
Why?
Hi. Just checking to see if you're here.
Where could he have gone?
I'm not coming back.
But we've been at it since six this morning. At least you could've let me go home and change.
You're right. I'm sorry. Okay, let's go get 'em.
So not only am I a troublesome bitch, but I'm fat too?
I know. I suppose you heard about Mr. Sheldrake --?
Fine. How's your eye?
That's up to you.
I never thought he'd do it.
They've got my Amado.
Well, don't give up now, Slick. You've already done so much for me. Hell, why don't you go back in time and save Mrs. Halpern and her baby. Then maybe Lenny wouldn't freak out and ruin my family.
Dad, no. But I didn't want any problems, so I decided not to sleep with him.
There is no fuckin' way on this planet or any other that I was in some fuckin' sorority.
There's one major hole in your story.
Off to change everyone's life again, is that it? Maybe this time you'll pop up in some mansion while I wind up in Tijuana doing the donkey act.
Sure you don't want your wallet?
Look at his face, he did the deed.
Excuse me?
You have?
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
Sir, if someone is suggesting that I'm a lesbian, they're wrong.
It's so late.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
It's just not the right time t...
Nice talk, Ben. Keep drinking. In between the hundred and one proof breath and the occasional drool, some interesting words fall from your mouth.
Right... the suitcase was clinking. So what did you do with your clothes?
Do what you've worked your whole life to do?
I didn't mean it nothin' dirty.
Are you drunk? Keep drinkin' water and you won't get a headache in the mornin'.
I guess you have.
Laz? Can I sleep with you tonight?
He said it was a gift.
Have a good day at work today.
I'm sorry, Doll, I just didn't want you to be late.
Hon.
What do you want?
When do we start?
Yeah, I know, I went back and forth on it.
Well--cut it out. See? Who cares anyway?
Do you know how I felt, Diz?
Like a mother sending her kid off to school for the first time--watchin' the little fella toddling off--in his best bib and tucker--and you sink in the middle--hoping he can stand up to the other kids--won't get his feeling hurt--and--if you could only spare him the knocks he's gotta take-- Say--who started this?
Shut up, Diz.
And I got him all dressed up, too-- to go way up in a balloon--so they can drop him a long way--make sure they break his heart. Why, not all the Boy Rangers in the world, working night shifts, 'll be able to put Humpty-Dumpty together again--
Are you limping? Why are you limping?
I see. But I hope you have a lot of sugar. Eli is ready to go to Zook's.
Ames here. Yessir...
I'm pregnant.
There are major fortunes to be made here. Leisure time and life styles.
You want to classify prime numbers?
This isn't a person to person call, Mr. Kitz. I don't really think the civilization sending the message intended it just for Americans.
-- which we'll also need the network's help to receive and decode!
Thanks for picking me up.
Thanks. So do you.
I know. He's just the best.
Yeah, I swiped it from Ms. Rancick.
Will you please take it?
What's it about?
It's not your table. It's the place's table. Behave. This once, you can sit at someone else's station.
Well... sure...
And who's Jill?
Wait a minute, the fourteenth, that's the same day the worm ends its run. I mean... Da Vinci virus, didn't Phreak say that's what he was being charged with? Look... "Infecting ballast programs of Ellingson tankers" - they blame hackers!
They need the money for my band uniform at school.
You never talked to me like that - in all these years.
Who is there?
What about the FBI?
And I with you. But you must wake.
Wake up, William. Wake up!
You're not a psycho!
Mom. Are you ok?
He belongs with those reptiles, Louis. He deserved to die.
I will let him go. He is dead to me as he is to all my mother's people. I turn my hand against him.
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts, I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to. I have intrusive thoughts all the time.
But one must love a father.
I don't know. As a child. I longed for a father and now - I don't know
You've earned it -- the horse ranch on the Toulomoe -- the girl in the spotted gingham.
You should know. She's in your dream.
Ever since you've looked after Steve you've had the dream -- a ranch on the river -- good grass, good water, barn corral and house --- that part you've shared with Steve. The girl in gingham you plan sneakin' in when he isn't looking.
She wears this gingham dress -- cooks popovers -- makes jam in season -- makes her own soap from pig fat and wood ashes and has cheeks the color of red apples.
But the rest is right.
Shut up. They'll hear you in the back.
All right.
I don't believe it.
Do you wanna tell me what that was all about?

Bye Niece, Vada.
Mom, they don't mind eating with one fork.
...umm...Listen, I'm sorry...you had to sacrifice your entire vacation.
You mean...it wasn't that terrible?
An adventure?
You're right. Good.
Too bad you didn't bring your whip.
But he knows you. All you have to do is get in touch with him, and tell him that Mimi says everything is all right... but that I've got to see him.
Dorothy! Is she here?
Geoffrey, you do so love putting on a disguise.
Can't we really go home? I can't breathe. Aren't you dying for green, anything green, or rain, wouldn't you die to feel rain on your face? It's Christmas and it's all - I don't know - if you asked me I'd go home tomorrow. If you wanted.
What?
I said I'll drop it.
So let's just drop the whole thing. Sugar? Lemon?
My husband's at the office.
That's not his apartment.
Mr. Gittes, you've talked me into it. I'll drop the lawsuit.
Thanks a lot, Brad. I really appreciate it.
Was it good?
Billy, do you have to smoke? Wendell can smell if someone's been smoking.
Oh great!!
I won, I won!!!
We moved around so much I barely knew my teachers.
I wouldn't worry about it. You've gotta figure most people around here were their teachers' pets.
No, I know what you mean. I used to spend my life wishing people could be like computers. Least they make sense. Sometimes you think they've betrayed you. Like a person would. But then you see, no, you just missed a step. You can go back and make it all work.
...Something like that. Yeah.
Father It's somewhere south-west of here - we need to inform the museum ... organize an expedition -
It's empty. Why would someone build a ship like this?
This is my brother-in-law, Karl Matuschka.
Please, I want to go back...
Anderton --
What is it?
I'll do it. I make a fabulous martini.
Don't worry about Paley. He can't touch me. No one can. I've thought it all out.
What a beautiful thought.
I do. I need a new sponsor.
He hates my fuckin' guts.
Exactly. He hates me.
I'm not as tough as you think I am.
I'm not and he scares the shit out of me. I never know what he's gonna do.
I need some help. I do. I need some help. You gotta help me. I need a new sponsor, Nicky.
You know what's wrong.
Uh -- Yes. Seventeen. Yes, I -- well no, I -- I never really... There's a place I go now, the cutest little place near my apartment in Greenwich Village. It's called Ann's 440. It's a beatnik bar.
I never know anymore.
Ta.
Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday.
What is it?
Yeah. Asked Rev. Pike if he could stay in the cellar.
He's sleeping in the church.
Unrile yourself, Stamp. It's only a few days he been there.
Can't nobody read minds long distance. All he have to do is ask somebody.
Pass me the empty bottle. I may find her... why, look. There's Rasputin.
You won't be long?
Merry Christmas eve.
And the passage to the barn?
Yes.
What did she mean?
The statue. She had shown it to me the day before.
Who?
Him.
Why?
So I could go to him.
How did she know about him?
She'd seen him too.
You shouldn't have talked to Norbert that way.
It's done with, Royce. Let it go.
What about him.
I'm tired of fighting back. I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
I said shut the fuck up --
You're heading for trouble, Fergus --
You shut your face --
Doesn't matter if he's hot. Just cover the fucker up.
Put that thing back on him, Fergus.
You will take them all, Mr. Jimmy?
Good night.
Don't knock it. A girl can save up a lot money doing this -- big money. Then you're free. You can go off to Europe, meet somebody, get married. My girlfriend's going to buy her own beauty parlor. Not me. I'm gonna travel. 'Keep movin' that's my motto. Would you rather work at Copper Penny at a dollar-eighty an hour, having every two-bit cocksucker able to yell at you? I can make more money suc... doing what I do for five minutes than I can all week at another job.
You don't understand shit.
I can paint anywhere.
You know what he's like. He just wants to work on stuff that's cool.
Did you ever live in a room with six people and you didn't have any money, any food, any furniture? Have your brother come out, his car break down, he can't get a job? Your friends stealing food, going through trash behind a supermarket?
Stop it! Stop it! IT HURTS!
Or what?
LET ME GO!
Bye.
How long can he stay down? Without breathing?
Turn around?
Two?
Yeah?
And look at it this way. How about Jim -- it puts him in a sort of tough spot.
Yes, that's why I said it.
Lightning struck. We caught it in a bottle. Don't let it out. I want to be with you, Joe --
Don't. That will come later.
It's a saying.
'Love will find out the way'.
I don't think so. Of course I was terribly upset... I hardly knew what I was doing.
Cecile if there's one thing I'm great at it's love letters. With my help, he'll be eating out of the palm of your hand. Perhaps we can arrange a little get together for the two of you at my house.
What happened to your neck?
I don't suppose there's a drink left...
I don't think I'm going.
Because I don't want to.
No, it's not. It's for this.
Where did the baby come from?
What baby?
The baby they made up.
Is that where they say it came from... ?
No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
Where'd it come from before that?
From God.
I don't know...
Yaay!
What are these?
It's gorgeous!
Yaay!
Yes, but the rope might be--
Am I really gonna have my own room?
Did you hide the letters?
Okay.
Oh? How's he doing?
Really? Congratulations, by the way.
'President's Science Advisor' -- so what, you just spend all your time jetting around on Air Force One now...?
No doubt.
Hey, screw you! Okay? You think I'm just somebody you can buy off! Listen, let me tell you something--
Well...yeah. Okay.
Okay. But you know, this business of finding you a wife -- it's kind of ridiculous, don't you think?
Yes it is. A girlfriend maybe. But a wife? I mean...
I was never politically correct enough for Comrade Dowd.
You're an anomaly in today's world, Max. You're good at what you do, so you must take pride in it...?
No? How many cabbies get you into an argument to save you money?
Why'd you do that? Don't tell me you're a gentleman, Max. I thought chivalry was dead as a necessary consequence of gender politics...
Different instrument altogether. You know, if you'd only listened to me, we'd be bogged down in traffic right now, and you could have made yourself an extra five bucks.
Violin. I never had the lungs for wind instruments.
I wonder did you ever think about it from my side.
Otherwise whatever we're looking for could be anywhere.
2,400?! Are you out of your mind?
Those shoes were twenty five dollars. C mon, take it off. We ll go to the food court and get one of those funnel cakes you like.
I mean...wow...off the charts great.
No?
Who?! Fuck, Leonard! Dodd! Dodd beat the shit out of me.
What happened, Duff?
What are you two up to?
I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral.
This is my good John Brown.
You've made me very happy, Johnny.
Sure.
So what's the big deal. Oh. Okay. They're like not good at basketball anymore. Like--omigod, what a tragedy.
Steve, stop it please...
No, Richard, no. What has happened to you? Last night we said --
But Richard, no, I, I --
Andy, the theater's that way!
I don't think so.
Cosmo?
I'll be with you in a moment, Benjamin. Will you send a police car to twelve hundred Glenview Road. We have a burgler here. Just a second. I'll ask him. Are you armed? No -- I don't believe he is. Thank you.
I think we have everything quite under control now, Benjamin. Would you like a quick drink before you go?
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite you to the wedding, Benjamin, but the arrangements have been so rushed --
Ahh. I don't think you'll have time for that drink after all.
Who's Herne the Huntsman?
Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe.
I see.
But everybody is all right.
Good boy.
We were in a car accident --
Pervert! What are you talking about?
To all those cons...
No, baby. He wants me.
He wants... your "sister"...
Yes, Billy?
I don't know. It all gets back to that Cynthia thing. I don't like her... eagerness. There's nothing left to imagine, there's no...
Not yet. I'm not sure I will. I just want out.
Kind of. I mean, John's like this kind of... craftsman. Like he's a carpenter, and he makes really good tables. But that's all he can make, and I don't need anymore tables.
Subtlety, yes. No subtlety. Plus, I've never really felt able to open up with anyone. I mean, that other person I told you about, I enjoyed making love with him a lot, but I still wasn't able to really let go. I always feel like I'm being watched and I shouldn't embarrass myself.
I'm babbling.
She's left before...
Do you want to get it now?
"Future" of...?
What's "nothing"?
Why don't you get it.
I don't think your gun's loaded...
Do you have a good map of Death Valley?
You don't make money gambling. You lose it.
What am I wanted for?
This is crazy. We don't have time for this.
I'm sorry, Walter.
What was prison like?
It's Thanksgiving.
Was that you? I remember that. I was only three or four, but I always heard about it growin' up. They say you're well?
Something must've happened! What set him off?
No, it wasn't a bat! I saw this horrible man - I remember him, I think...
Oh God... what did we do?
No -- you're not.
We been through these off-seasons before -- we made it.
You're too weak, Frank. When you want something you have to do what- ever it takes to get it. If something gets in your way you remove it.
Fuck him! He tried to shatter mine.
I do need you. No matter what you think of me -- I didn't do it.
I knew you were thinking that. I could see it in your eyes today in the courtroom. You're wrong, Frank. I need you to believe that.
I'll... take your word for it. So who are you, then?
We object, Your Honor. It would unfairly influence the jury.
I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.
And what if the broadcast dishes on top of 21 aren't hot yet? You said the place isn't finished.
'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
This sofa is a lethal weapon. The springs... are... the springs... what...?
"For Excellence in the Pursuit of Truth."
The...Silver...Mike...Award!
Yup.
Thank you.
Yeah, but if you heard this band called the Crumblers, you'd --
No way! I'd cramp his style. And I wouldn't want to listen to all that stuff happening on the other side of the bedroom wall. I'm way to unattached for that.
Yeah, I know the Crumblers! I bought a used Blasters album in New York about ten years ago and somebody left a Crumblers single in it. My everything changed for a couple of weeks.
No, sir...
The stiff one eye?
Melvin, I'd rather not.
What are you doing here?
No, Travis. You're a sweet guy and all that, but I think this is it. I'm going home.
Caesar, maybe we should run --
I mean it, Caesar, forget Johnnie, forget the money, let's just go now, before it's too late --
That's all!
Okay, are you sure, cause, I mean, how do you know? Because, see, the crime I'm investigating, the perpetrators were driving a car with dealer plates. And they called someone who works here, so it'd be quite a coincidence if they weren't, ya know, connected.
The hell you will, Harry York.
Oh my God, sorry. I'm interrupting.
You know it's true.
I'll be right out.
It's our anniversary, Panes.
We're just feeling our way back.
Oh, hello.
I don't think I ever spent half a day in the Beverly Center.
I'm in the same room with Sally Nash. Oh my God. You're my icon. I've been watching your films since I was a little girl. Like, four years ago I followed you all around the Beverly Center - at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.
I unnerstand. I'll keep it real short, then. I'm on my way out of town, but I was just - Do you mind if I sit down? I'm carrying a bit of a load here.
Oh. The bullets.
David, let me tell you something. These people don't want to be geeks. They want to be "attractive." They've got a lot of potential, they just don't know any better.
David, nobody's happy in a Poodle skirt and a sweater set. You like all this don't you?
I mean, you don't think it's just like dorky or funny or something ... you really like it. Oh God! I am just so personally horrified right now ...
It sounds kind of nice ... being somebody brand new.
Rita... I want you to stay here and you don't have to give me that money.
But I want to.
Sure, Heaven! You've probably thought up another coal mine to send me down in -- to get a new story for your paper!
Oh.
Just a little. I've had a tough day.
Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles.
Paul! Paul's eyes adjust, he recognizes many of his neighbors, all crowded into this small room. Then he sees their friends Odette and her husband Jean Baptiste.
Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor.
But she watches... she listens.
Nonsense, I'm your mother now and I want you to eat.
Mommy I'll get bigger and bigger every day and then I'll pop but... but if I stay little it won't happen.
Your mother tells you this?... Agnes your mother is dead.
God blew up the Hindenburg. He'll blow me up, that's what she said...
Who?
No... I mean... I mean look at these. I've got to lose weight, I'm a blimp.
Oh my dear child.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat something Agnes.
No.
You don't know that.
Wait...
Yes.
What?
You better know what you're doing, George. You're playing with fire.
Oh, don't be such a fucking hypocrite. I quit smoking, didn't I?
I know what you just said. Ellie, clear your place.
That's enough of that kind of talk!
I don't want you up all night reading Edward's case file of the nine millionth time. Balance, dear girl, is the key. Leave the work here.
In his apartment.
Tell me he's living in squalor. Tell me everything he has is being repossessed, including his filthy, dented mobile home.
Boats. You go out in them. You come back in them. I hate them.
Someone from the office.
So I was thinking about what you were saying - y'know, about really being kissed? I think Roger could be the one.
All right. What's the scoop?
Did you memorize the whole book or only the good parts?
It's your choice. Because it's not safe for you to be awake. To be walking around. To be thinking about things.
This is what I'm talking about, Norman. Don't you see? It's in you. This vindictiveness. This rage.
Yeah. Lenny. I have.
I guess.
One thing that's hard to understand is how you could have this incredible background in music, and then just walk away from it, without a second thought...
What's wrong, Carl, you hardly ate anything...
If you're free.
Carl has hydrotherapy on Tuesdays.
Tomorrow's a full practice day... But the day after is kind of open.
How ill is he?
Then why are you not with him?
What is the matter with him?
Why was I not informed?
How long?
When did you get out of jail?
Where at?
He's just repeating shit he overheard. He ain't any more a gun expert than I am.
Want a hit?
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's a cool car. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
What kind of a horrible thing is that?
Well then, I guess I'd better leave the two of you alone. But don't forget...
Haven't you been listening?
Why not?
My boss.
I was looking for Annabelle's book, and I found your tickets. And the note. From your new boss.
I don't know wh...
We just live one flight up.
Look, here she is. Margaret Ann Muldovan - Newspaper, Literary magazine, French Club, Drama Club, Debate Club, Girls Basketball and Swim team. With Maggie's combo of good looks and talent, we're sure to be seeing her name in lights. She was gonna be famous.
We've done the hard part now. I might as well, you know...
He asked where you were! He wants you with him.
It's the leather bindings, I love the fragrance of vintage books.
No they're not. I wanna be a writer, I wanna be just like you.
Of course she is. No other name is going to sign on now and risk offending her.
His face.
Oh, you just moved here to think about it, right?
What feelings?
Like maybe a big part?
Graham, I mean, what do you think her reaction is going to be if you contact her?
Look at you, look at what's happened to you, look how you've changed! Don't you think she will have changed?
Whoa!! I'm so glad we got that on tape!! You won't answer a question about Elizabeth, but I have to answer all these intimate questions about my sex life!! Graham, what do you think she's going to make of all these videotapes? Are you going to tell her about them? I can't imagine her being too understanding about that. But since you don't lie anymore, you'll have to say something.
Mine are like my neck and my chest.
He does that every single day.
That guy is totally amazing.
At least the wheelchair guy is sort of entertaining...
I don't know... Some people are okay, but mostly I feel like poisoning everybody.
God, how can you stand all these assholes?
That rules!
He's a total asshole... He doesn't even need that wheelchair, he's just totally lazy!
Yep, yep. But he has to know what he's doing and where he's going. Because they can like touch you for hours and they won't ever know.
Hell yeah, they don't know.
Like where are your erogenous zones?
Mine?
You ain't dead.
Who told!
Roger in Op Ed.
Well, that doesn't mean it was going to happen for sure.
He didn't have to hit him. It's not exactly like I'm sleepin' with the guy! And he makes me sneak around to see my own friends! What the fuck is that all about?
No!
Dead?
What's the matter?
Well, haven't you got anybody else?
Sweeney? Well, after all, he didn't do it on purpose, did he?
He could have killed him! Okay? He could have killed him.
I do.
I would just want to clear some things up:
-- just to clarify --
I'm confused about your past is the thing.
What?
-- let's talk more about your background --
It's getting quiet.
Stop!
Well, we've come a long way, haven't we? I want to go home.
Why would you put a fallout shelter under a porno shop?
Adam!!
"And so the Professor lifted Colombe's skirt high, above her waist. 'Let me be your Tutor,' said he, 'in the ways of love.' With that, he slid her pantalettes down, down, down over her knees, and there -- nestled between her legs -- as pink as a tulip, as slick as an eel --"
Then how can we know who is truly good, and who is evil?
I just wanted to say hello.
I'd never be able to talk her into it. And even if I could, those things cost money. And that's just what I don't have. I'm flat out dead broke.
Always the lawyer.
I'd like yours too.
I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job.
This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as "the early 70's." Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me.
I don't care what his family's like or if he doesn't have any brothers, but he doesn't have to lie to me.
Is that supposed to comfort me?
I'll buy that. Black's always good.
These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide?
He read the letters, Nick. Some day I wasn't there. He went through my room. He found your letters.
He's not a bad person, Nick... he's not...
Since Janey moved in... Gabriel... he's come over more and more. To the apartment. Janey's the divorced one, 'member, with the tit job --
Nick, no --
Hello, Juliet. Juliet take off her jacket.
Hello!
turns around and Juliet presents her with a brown paper bag.
Fruit.
Oh! I'll pop them in a bowl.
That is so unfair.
Like recognizes like. I'm pretty tough, myself.
You're tougher than Bud thinks you are.
Actually, Bud's only tough on the outside.
-- No. No really.
Quit feeling sorry for yourself, Tom. It gets old.
Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
Don t go, Jack...
The same thing I suppose.
Go. I m sorry, you should just go...
Right, for us. But...I m afraid that if you get on that plane...
We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
Me?! You want me to take care of Billy?!
I know! I know!
Nothing.
It must be something.
Well, it's George.
I thought you said things were great with George.
In general. Do you take risks in other areas of your life?
Do you take risks?
Well they are. But we have problems. You say things are great with Lester. Is he going to marry you?
Yes. My room is down here -- I'm not tired. Do you want to keep talking?
Another thing I can't stand is ...when White House reporters bullshit with each other after a briefing and then one of them has a theory and the other quotes it in his story as "White House" sources say...
I was doing sports at the station. The newspaper ran this untrue story that I was leaving and they got all these tons of protest mail. So they made me anchor.
So great -- right?
Come on...Even I'm not that hard on myself.
But you have problems?
How are you at back rubs?
Consider this my resignation --
Yes, I'm ready. Goodbye, Rick. God bless you.
Yes.
And you, you-you're going?
You look it too. You haven't been working out, you haven't been taking your vitamins! You haven't been drinking your herbs, you haven't been...
Right now, I'm more worried about my mother than anything. They won't let her see my father.
That's what I told her. If she could just see him a second, then I could take her home.
I'll get some towels.
You want to go with me?
I got your package. It was fun getting a half-a-million dollars in the mail.
You were asleep when I left. I didn't want to wake you. Did you go out?
You know, I've been living here for almost three years. Now in three days it seems as if I know everybody. When I pass people on the street I want to stop and say, "Listen, I got a fella."
Eddie, where do you go when you go out?
... And if we repaint the walls, we'll need new curtains, you put the painters on you Visa and I'll do the curtains on American Express... for the couch there's Bloomingdales... or are you still over your limit?
I'm sorry, she hung up. What are --
"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's kiss and make up."
... Where are you calling from?
And you're not now?
And do what? Take on his whole posse?
No! No! I told him all about the guy before we ever got married. This is no fuckin' surprise.
Tell me.
Yeah, no shit.
Leave him alone, Peter. He's in love.
Do you still teach?
Hi! Hi!
Glad you could put in an appearance.
Yes.
He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him?
No.
Can you do it or not?
Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity.
Will you excuse me?
Well -- thank you.
Yes, I know.
I don't know what you're talking about.
You do and I'll die, Martie...I will! I'll just die!
I can still see myself in the line: Bebe Daniels, Marie Prevost, Mabel Normand ... Mabel was always stepping on my feet ...What's the matter with you, darling? Why are you so glum?
Who?
Now, now do you belive me? I told you deMille would jump at it.
I don't know it. I feel it.
No, I don't.
Hi!
It's him. He's got California plates. It's the same guy.
Pass him!
You're drivin'.
Oh my God! Louise! Look! Look! See if that's him!
It would have to be pretty damn good.
We should head a little further in. There's not that many roads in this state. I want to try to hit Mexico somewhere not so close to New Mexico. They probably wanna kill us in New Mexico.
He's gonna die! They'll kill him!
We're fine! How are you?
Jesus Christ ! How could you do this to him? How could you do this?
Don't let them separate us.
AH UGH.
They know. They've been watching us. I can feel it.
I thought you were someone else
You sure say "God" a lot when we're doing it.
You know, I've decided: I'm just gonna believe what you believe about this whole Solaris thing, it'll make life so much easier; the little wife agreeing with her big, strong husband. You must get such a headache thinking about those Great Big Problems all day.
I like that too.
Good. Because I want you to know. I really like fucking you.
Do you have any idea how much I like fucking you?
Okay, til tonight.
Yeah. I'll do that. As long as you're not patronizing me.
I love you.
No. No, listen to me here. I want to know what you're talking about. You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and...
Promise?
I know. I know. He didn't go.
Yes, but what happened to George?
Jesus Christ, Ed -- you know, the more I work on this thing, the more I realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. Here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer -- that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water -- and we're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? That's just not right.
That's a secret.
...give a kiss to Edward.
Give a kiss to Edward.
Thanks Miriam. Say hi to Henry and...
You're looking well.
Agent Novak.
Mister Washington, why don't we get a good head start on the day by shaving Mister Bromden and see if we can't avoid a disturbance.
It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas.
I'm beginning to have my doubts. It couldn't be that they're in love?
Twelve years ... But why haven't they married?
I can't imagine you crying.
I'm telling you your life!
Plato, where's your father now?
Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed?
You must not remember anything. Come on.
'63 Chevy.
That is so amazing. I'm in awe of people who can fix things. My dad was like that. We never had anything new. Whenever something broke he would open it up, tinker with it and it would work. His hands were magic.
Be a gentleman. You have to help me down.
No, no trouble. There's other work to do.
Yes, it really causes problems. Sometimes it's like you're in the same room. But if it's too much trouble, I understand ...
Yeah.
You're doing everything yourself?
Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, right. Fuck you.
Okay, thank you.
What? What do you stand for?
Typical male.
Typical male.
Now don't make me feel as if I'm being too forward, OK? If you don't --
Well, maybe they have one of those filter jobs in the kitchen --
My husband is probably passed out in the bathroom, or at least he wishes he were. I've been married to him for 17 years and I don't have any intention of going in there to get him... so what I'm proposing is that since your wife has gone off with a boy, and since you are standing here alone, I'm proposing that you and I do what makes sense. Stay warm. Pass some time. That's all.
Let me.
You couldn't have hoped for much better when you came up the walk.
Oh, Calvin, I'm not sure we should be making promises that perhaps can't be kept.
Oh-oh! Touch , Mr Lombard! But tell me, what would you know about sisterly love, eh? No. Don t. You might get confused speaking of things you don t understand and we need you clear- headed, at least until you ve done what we are paying you for.
JUST DO IT!
What's wrong with you?! Tell him I'm not here!
I came with Captain Renault.
Could I speak to you for just a moment, please?
Monsieur Rick?
So are you. Are you shaking?
What was that?
He's my friend, too.
Pick a suit.
Are you really a virgin?
Does it bother you? What he said?
You're not a loser, Eddie. You're a winner. Some men never get to feel that way about anything. I love you, Eddie.
I love you.
Yes, I need them very much. And if you ever say them I'll never let you take them back.
Yes, I'm glad.
Mr. Loomis, you're so busy being defensive that you haven't even reacted to the most serious fact of all. Mary is missing.
M'm, that was so nice. That was nice.
And this guy is...
You didn't care about my case?
Frank...
Oh. And your first wife was Allison?
You're insane.
I'm sorry I brought the whole thing up! If you're gonna flip your wig --
We've had this conversation already, Daniel.
Gustafson's accountant.
Why?
I've thought about it for years. I knew you'd come. And I knew if you did - you'd never leave. Am I forgiven for sending for you?
This'll be our first. We've been waiting a long time.
Yah. Well, I just can't thank you enough, Detective Sibert, this cooperation has been outstanding.
End a April.
Oh, my.
Boy, this thing is really... geez.
...Tonight!
My parents are growing suspicious! I can't keep meeting you every night!
Shush. It's only been a day. And it's seemed like forever.
Sorry - didn't copy.
I'll call you again.
No.
I think he suspects something... We have to be careful... I miss you.
Pete?
Nothing's changed since yesterday, or last week, or last month... the answer's still "no."
And I should have a son who calls me "Mom". Looks like we're both shit out of luck.
Betcha' didn't predict that.
To see Dad?
What are you going to do with it?
Where did you get that?
Where's Mom?
Will you give this to him.
He won't neither. He never has.
He can take all comers.
I'm afraid not. I promised to have a drink with him -- he's been calling me all week --
What time does the show go on?
Just tell 'em -- now and then.
It used to be serious -- at least I was -- but he wasn't -- so the whole thing is more or less kaputt.
Great.
I was born just two blocks from this studio. Right on Lemon Grove Avenue. Father was head elec- trician here till he died. Mother still works in Wardrobe.
It's that old familiar story, you help a timid little soul across a crowded street. She turns out to be a multimillionaire and leaves you all her money.
Look at this street. All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors. I like it better than any street in the world. Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid.
I don't think so.
You know, Babe Brother's wife just dumps greens in the pot without washing them.
You're insane if you think you'll find anything, and sure insane if you think you can get us there and back alive.
I have cancer. Do you know what that is?
Nor have I. Even though you disappeared... But what's the point of talking about it? We risk being pathetic and ridiculous. You still live in Rome?
I'm not making any promises.
More this way.
STOP!
Can you fly?
To the shark.
...Brian hurt his foot.
No.
- in a tin can, cellophane or wrapped in a Navajo blanket, I want you home...
When - when are you coming back?
Bill, you know how much I do - but over the phone, now really, that's kid stuff...
Sing it?
But "nice".
That's nice. And you live in Queens? With a child, and a dog...?
I saw you with a dog, in my mind.
You don't like him, do you?
The bathroom.
Thank you, Mr. Bates.
I have?
Early, can we stop there... just for a little while.
I want to talk to them first. I know more now about Ordell's money.
The Delfonics.
'74, I think.
I called in sick this morning. As far as the airline knows, I'm still available.
I don't know yet. I'm going to talk with Dargus and Nicolet today. Do what you suggested. Offer to help and see what happens.
Can I have milk too?
Can I have my supper please?
Because John said I mustn't.
No.
How are you today?
I have a question for you, Mr. Stephens.
But we must respect that power, we must be in awe of it.
Oh. Does that make you sad? Or anxious? I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest, y'know? Taking advantage of every possibility? Just making sure that I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.
Well, I go to a psychic and she's always telling me I'm psychic. She should know. Do you believe in that stuff?
Me neither. But sometimes I have premonitions, so, I don't know. Maybe that's just coincidence. Right? Y'know, you think something and then it happens, or you think a word and then someone says it? Y'know?
Exactly. Exactly! That's exactly my feeling about it. It's hard to know. Like, okay, but how many times do I think something and it doesn't happen? That's what you're saying, right? You forget about those times. Right?
But I think I am. I like to think I am.
It's helpful to think there's some order to things. You're kind of closed mouthed, aren't you?
I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it.
Be kind to her. She loves you so much. In a perfectly proper way, of course.
But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard.
Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in.
So find a dime. Let's get out of here.
It's isolated.
You got anybody, Wick?
He was married?
How'd you make it last time, Wick? How'd you get through this part?
Let's keep talkin', Wick. Just keep talkin' to me...
Here, I stole you a couple of extra clams.
Well, let's hope so.
Uh, no, the shrimp puffs are Holly's. I do the, uh, cr pes caviar.
We need more bread and some baked lasa-- uh, lasagne. Hi.
You've got to get yourself out of that place. They're going to kill you if you don't.
What about Captain Medley? He never told them what happened to you over there. His testimony...that coward wanted them to think you were crazy.
They told me Becker's in Shelbourne now. I looked him up and he was listed.
How long do we have?
He's a decent fellow, the President, isn't he?
You take care too, Bobby.
You're right, Mr. President I don't like feeling sorry for myself.
Nonsense, Mr. President - I thank you for coming to spend time with a dying man.
My name is Miss Ratched. I'm the head nurse here. You've already met Miss Pilbow and Aides Washington and Warren.
Mister McMurphy!
He was quite impressed with your comments, Chauncey - he hears my sort of analysis from everyone, but yours, unfortunately - seldom if ever at all.
Jack, are you okay?
You made the front page.
Great place for lunch.
Maybe you just need -- look, can you wait here a sec, I need to tidy up -- just a minute, I'll be right back. You'll wait?
Ben, I've got a ride home. Maybe you should sleep this one off on the couch here?
You'll get some sleep on the couch out there?
Just my dad.
He was here for four days.
So you sat it out, that's what you did?
If you were Diane Court, would you honestly fall for Lloyd?
Well, it shattered your faith in everything.
Like you need to admit that losing your parents when you were twelve was traumatic.
So am I.
Nay, bigger; women grow by men.
But my name isn't Leland Palmer.
I'm sorry, Mom.
Dad.
Don't be late.
Yes, daddy.
Yes, daddy.
I'll show you.
Yes, I did.
Yes.
Where did you find that?
That day, had you followed me to the market?
Shall we be all right?
Nothing. I mean, nothing. I try not to do anything that will produce garbage, so obviously we're talking about eating and basic stuff like that. Did you know that the average person produces three pounds of garbage a day?
I understand.
Give 'em my number.
Is something wrong?
Lungs sound fine. You didn't have any pre-existing physical conditions, did you? Allergies? Infections?
Right down to the ground. Let's get to it.
You put filth in my child's mouth.
Aw.
You had her lie about that... that fancy-boy model!
He was almost expelled for calling one of his professors a "pompous... Fellow..."
He set things right with a proper apology... and now they've put him in charge of dissection lab!
Designer clothes.
The fitting room. There's a sign over the door.
This is spectacular.
...Did you really say that?
Besides, I don't want to be what you want to make me.
Normal. Average.
Do you expect me, for one moment, to believe you have greater insight into my personality than I do?
You may discuss my predicament, Doctor. You may discuss it with anyone you like, but not with me. I'm not interested. I can solve my problems without recourse to a veternarian.
Damn, Jimmy, did you take a pill that makes you say all the right stuff?
Be brave. He'll come back - with or without gas.
I just never think of Lloyd as anywhere but indoors and anything but sitting down.
It doesn't matter.
Do you want it on?
Thank you, Lloyd. Godspeed.
It seems to me that walking, for most people, is not very dangerous.
He always looks so pathetic whenever he does anything physical-
Karen. I haven't been pleasant this weekend.
I detest cheap sentiment.
Yeah?
He's got more sense than you have. Thank Heaven you're not on this case.
I wish that doctor'd come. How do you feel?
Easy.
It's your time mister. Fifteen minutes ain't long. That cigarette burns out, your time is up.
I don't like my real name.
It's easy to remember. Easy Lay.
Iris.
No, I'm serious.
But Mrs. Farren just started to tell me a story. Please.
The Walkers loved Sean. He was their only child...the object of all their attention. I mean, Wendell's a withdrawn sort of man. That's his nature. But Risa, she's still got dreams.
Patience. Concentrate. You will find a way.
Doesn't that come next?
Whatever it is that makes you such a riot with women.
Come on Cyril, try a little bit of it out on me. I haven't had any first-class blarney thrown at me since the day I was married.
Now let me see, what comes next? Oh yes, I know - what are you doing tonight, Phyllis?
running around. Not your work. You'd better start reforming, Cyril!
Not bad, not bad at all. Do you know something? I've always been curious about your line.
Oh, I worked there for a couple of vacations, but I don't know . . . I guess I was homesick.
As above, so below.
No, you're only going to hurt him some more.
Oh my God. That is so not funny. You're late. You're really late. Now get out here and have some cereal.
Ok, well... I love you.
Oh well... ... look through the wigs, maybe it got caught-
Every day.
Where's my coat?
I'm a friend of Bonanza Jellybean's.
To the hospital.
Why are you saying that? We don't have long, do we?
Because your body can only take so much of what they're putting you through.
You'll take fifty and like it!
Don't Hildy me! Are you going to let him out?
And who accused him? Diamond Louis! One of the worst crooks in town! Why don't you arrest Louis instead of innocent people that he frames?
You can let him out on bail, can't you?
All right. You can't. But tomorrow the Post will run the story of that roulette game on 43rd Street that your brother-in-law runs. And we'll print that you get five hundred a month for forgetting about it!
That sounds great can you hold on... What Zoe?
It was the beginning of the end.
Yeah.
Why?
Merry Christmas, Jack.
Can I stay here tonight? Even if she comes here?
Jack.
From Hurley's?
Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
Why not? But that's not how things wound up. I'm with Lenny, Lenny's your friend. And there it ends.
Yes, Mister Harding?
... There is no longer any margin for inflation, it has gone as far as it can, you've reached your limits on taxation, dependence on foreign energy has reached a crisis, and, from where I see it, Mr. President, the Free Enterprise System has reached the breaking point. We are on the brink of another crash from which recovery might not be possible.
I'm afraid so.
Sure. Just like your men do.
No.
I know. She's so young and he's so -
I don't know. I thought, maybe I'd move in with my parents for a while.
Yes, we're going to have this conversation again. I...I have to leave. I have to move out.
Because I have to!
No.
Stop staring. Do a vase.
No... Absolutely not. I'm shyer than you think. I give the wrong impression sometimes and...
All right, cut me a break.
Thanks. But I just want to take a bath and...
Maybe.
I can imagine.
I have a tattoo, would you like to see it?
Lainey and I just wanted to congratulate...
... Simone.
I promise. Come to bed, honey.
It's a good idea for a newspaper. Four hundred sixy thousand.
Look at that.
Let's hope they like it there.
What?
You're what?
I know the truth, John. I'm flying in some guys from your unit in Vietnam tomorrow. Interviewing them live on network hookup!
Yes, mom?
Do you have any family, Mr. Creasy?
This is Mr. Creasy.
My father's the preacher.
It was my idea, Grandma. I always wondered what went on at those lodge meetings.
Grandpa, if you had a chance to do it all again, what would you do?
What does Grandma think you do at your meetings?
Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay.
Certainly, Mr. Duke!
Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross-section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. "Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you."
That's right.
I'm sorry, I just...
I think it's cute - look at his little weasel teeth.
I have feelings for you.
How long you been up, you need a nap.
You know, I think I... ordered some just the other day.
What's the first?
Why are you doing this?
You're tired, Ronnie.
If you think I would ever give you the nanobot after this, you are deluding yourself.
I need an introduction to the Obregon Brothers.
Ohhh yes. No, no. Just a little, you know...We're fine.
Remember this from our junior prom? Boy, were you ever mad for Madonna.
But we do have a choice. To make it better. Instead of worse.
Uh-huh. What can be?
No. I'm just not sure what you mean.
Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man.
Tired.
Come on, sit up.
No, they couldn't. Father was a doctor. The kind who placed ethics above collections. That speaks well for Father but it always left us kind of-- Could we get on with this, Senator?
Oh, wow, she's great.
Potato bug sits on the leaf in the sun, Sleep, sleep, my baby -- Raccoon sits in the spruce all night, Sleep, baby, sleep --
Peter.
When you lived with the Fairfaxes?
You too.
That woman!
Sam. He said an hour. Or less.
'Pro bono'. That means doing good -- Going to be doing good all your life?
Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now?
I can't leave him!
Because it's quiet. And he wants to talk. Alise -- Once he saws you in half, it's bedtime...
So, aren't you going to ask me?
He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead... You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same.
What do you think of that, Jabez?
I don't care what you wanted to tell me. You're through! Get your things and get out!
Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up now. If you want to ask me any questions, call me at home in a couple of days. I'm in the book.
He doesn't want to hurt anybody. Please leave him alone.
You sure this is your car?
No, you're naturally smart. You always think of the funniest things to do. Remember when you passed me that postcard during Spanish class, and it was addressed like, "Junebug MacGuff, Row 4, Third Seat From the Blackboard"? And it said, "I'm having fun in Barcelona -- wish you were here"? That was hilarious.
No, for real. I think you are the coolest person I've ever met. And you don't even have to try.
Also, I think I'm in love with you.
You know, I've been thinking. I'm really sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You didn't deserve that. You never deserve any of the poo I unload on you.
Plus, you're the only person who doesn't stare at my stomach all the fucking time. You actually look at my face. And every time I look at you, the baby starts kicking me super hard.
No.
Did it really go well?
Okay. Sorry. Don't yell at me like that again, you scared the life out of me.
You really think I look sexy in this smock?
Yes.
Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
Oh darling -- is that for me?
Helen, did you ever try competing with a bank?
Oh, it was.
No.
Please don't ask me to go back again. I'm frightened! I'm very, very frightened.
Oh yes, sir. He's all right. And he's working on it very hard.
mmmhmm.
I don't want you, Steven.
In five years?
You're here?
There's nothing to talk about.
Oh? Purely scientific interest I'm sure.
Well, that'll be a little complicated --
I can handle it.
Grace?... Grace, you want to come with us, take a look at Pilgrim?
You don't seem too happy about it.
Let me guess, Russia came up?
Grandma was still alive. Chiro was still home going to school. Now he's married and gone to Florida. If you and Johnny moved in, had a baby...
I figure, if we could take care of a puppy, we could, you know, take care of --
Johnny has a big apartment. We'll live there.
Pop don't like Johnny.
We sat in B massive traffic jam under an off-ramp. I don't think we moved more than fifty yards. I'm thinking of taking up a new job with the Road Research Laboratory. They need a medical officer. The salary is larger something I've got to think about now. There's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, I'm beginning to feel. Well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.
I've found that I enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. I like to look at it. Yesterday I hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. "Anywhere", I said.
Do you want a cigarette? I started to smoke at the hospital. It's rather stupid of me.
I work in the immigration department there.
It's much worse now. You noticed that, did you? The day I left the hospital I had the extraordinary feeling that all these cars were gathering for some special reason I didn't understand. There seemed to be ten times as much traffic.
Oh my G-d. We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him. I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!!
I want to hear everything he said.
Alright. Go ahead.
What do you mean you know? He told you he was gonna propose to me?
Oh, nothing much. Just that the state had proved he was sane -- and he admits it himself. If you don't want me to run it --
All right, then, I'll just run the story that Sheriff Hartman is afraid to let reporters interview his prisoner. Of course, with election coming, that might do you a lot of harm, but just as you say.
Same way you did. Through that gate.
Woman can change better'n a man. Man lives in jerks--baby born, or somebody dies, that's a jerk--gets a farm, or loses one, an' that's a jerk. With a woman it's all one flow, like a stream, little eddies, little waterfalls, but the river it goes right on. Woman looks at it like that.
Could you stop, please. You're giving me a headache.
I know. Maybe that makes us tough. Rich fellas come up an' they die, an' their kids ain't no good, an' they die out. But we keep a-comin'. We're the people that live. Can't nobody wipe us out. Can't nobody lick us. We'll go on forever, Pa. We're the people.
I'll have it.
Next week.
I'll have a decision by next week.
Oh Joe... Joe she didn't kill the baby.
I can get you new evidence next week.
Good evening.
And isn't it a lovely one? So sturdy, so straight --
Candy-stripe a cancer ward. It's not my problem.
Why?!
Please don't go.
Look at me! I'm gonna change.
Yeah? Give me a goodbye kiss.
Not even when it meant something. Is that One Night up in Flatbed?
Don't worry about it, boss.
-- Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.
You're not serious.
Dr. Allen, could you please tell Mr. Kelson what you heard as you tried to enter Mr. Birdson's room?
Yes. As I said, I couldn't keep my eyes...
In fact, never.
Much later.
Later, "Dude".
Thanks for the tape - I'll have to pay you later, I'm broke.
We should follow them!
Hey, look, the satanists are leaving!
You know, sacrifice virgins and stuff...
What do you do if you're a satanist, anyway?
I don't know.
Get in, Auggie. I've got something to show you.
Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
What's inside?
So you think time travel is possible? For people?
What's that?
I	know what a burrito is.
And the other alternative?
---and you'll end up doing a free consultation on his arthritis or urinary problems and---
What value is that? You may recall what German guarantees have been worth in the past.
You're not really going over to have a beer with that old guy, are you?
Occupied France?
This morning you implied it was not safe for him to leave Casablanca.
No. Answer it!
You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
Crap. It's not relative. It's unfair. Like your casino. It's designed unfair. And your croupier's a little shit because he goes along with it.
The door, Jack.
Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
Yeah? Like Ralph Lauren?
And I suppose you see him in some sort of strapless thing, don't you?
Well, that's blunt!
What's that supposed to mean?
Wazoo! Try to listen. Whataya think? Surfer, grunge, hip- hop, Euro trash?
Congratulations, Eve.
Thank you, Karen.
I want to know why you need that scary guy in your house.
You better quit that.
Well, I don't know. The week started off okay, but then I was outside watering the plants, and I started feeling dizzy from the heat and that got me thinking about the Greenhouse Effect, so I went inside and turned on the air-conditioner full blast, and that made me feel a little better until I started thinking about radon leakage coming up through the floor, and --
I won't.
Ah...
...but first, you have to tell me something...
I haven't seen him in two years.
Lenny, give them the tape.
Ed, it was only one review.
Where you goin'!?
Uh huh.
Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
Oh yes, of course.
Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it.
At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more.
Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least...
It takes a key. He keeps it on himself all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.
What are we supposed to do...? What about our medical coverage; what about our health? What about our car payments? The payments on this house?
No, thank you.
It's an experimental model. He doesn't dare leave it in his car, for fear it will fall into the hands of competition.
He told me one time what the proudest moment of his life was. He made Eagle Scout when he was twenty-nine years old. Oh, Norbert--promise me that Paul has not gone into the park!
No! Oh no! Three people murdered in there in the last six weeks! The police won't even go in there any more.
It's suicide!
Meaning?
Well, besides Charlie, of course.
Saturday, I have some things to do around the house.
Hmmm....
Yes, but George . . .
Thank God for that!
If I'd known you were alive --
What are you gonna talk about?
Right back, you said you'd be right back.
I got married.
I would never --
No!
You shouldn't have pushed us!
I'm fine.
THE WHITEFOLK?
Oh, come on. It's early.
You okay?
Bobby? Are you all right?
Can you make it back up?
well, I don't know. It could have been anybody. There are a lot of, you know, subversive elements around Millard. You know, like Rick Thieson and Kevin Speck and those burn-outs. Or Doug Schenken - what about him? Or what about Tammy Metzier? Her whole thing is being anti- this and anti-that.
Why are you lecturing me?
I don't know what you're referring to, but I do know that if certain older and wiser people hadn't acted like such little babies and gotten all mushy, everything would be okay.
And I think certain older persons like you and your "colleague" shouldn't be leaching after their students, especially when some of them can't even get their own wives pregnant. And they certainly shouldn't be running around making slanderous accusations. Especially when certain young, naive people's mothers are para-legal secretaries at the city's biggest law firm and have won many successful lawsuits. And if you want to keep questioning me like this, I won't continue without my attorney present.
Geez, that's a good lead. The Blue Ox, that's that trucker's joint out there on I-35?
Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
And why not? My fortune, siphoned away. My reputation, past repair. I've nothing left to lose. Silence my husband, or you'll come to know an infamy to rival his own.
Public scorn carries a terrible sting. Trust me. I'm a woman who knows.
I see you're going hunting.
You're going hunting?
What are you doing?
Nick?
Someone tell me this is really happening.
That you, Valerian?
Maybe I could talk to Rigfort, you know, tell him the whole story.
Okay, you're having an emotional crisis. You need to seek the help of a trained --
Who is this?
Whoever you are, don't call again.
I uh, I didn't finish, I... fell asleep.
It beats 'What's your major?'
It really didn't hurt that bad having him.
Shit. Hey, can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?
Thundercats are go!
Or...
Either I just pissed my pants or...
What?!
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.
You mean I have to wait for it to get even worse? Why can't they just give it to me now?
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey. The doctor said you're not dilated enough.
Ow, ow, fuckity-ow. Bren, when do I get that Spinal Tap thing?
On tape?
Why not?
I remember. You could do that, couldn't you? Go down on me?
If I asked you to, would you? Not on tape, I mean?
Can't or won't?
I appreciate your concern, but we live in that house. I need to know what happened in there.
Because what I'm doing is so ugly ... Because if you told me right now: "Claudia, I love you," I would believe you...
But just think -- the very same things you had said to her who knows how many times... maybe even just before we left, while I was waiting outside your place...
Get some sleep.
Shhh!
I don't know. We'll figure it out.
I'm sorry about last night. I shouldn't have brought it up over the phone.
If he's your brother, why does he have a different name?
Yeah. Bye.
I'm a slow reader, on account of the fact that I look at the word "dog" and see "god".
I knew how planes flew, but I was still a little nervous.
'Cuz we don't need to draw any more shit down on our heads. We hit whoever's between us and Israel. I don't want to dead the whole floor and I don't want to be killing women no matter how they make a living.
Wait, I'm getting some fucked up feedback off that earpiece --
Why?
Nuthin', we cool. There was somethin' about a fed being in the building.
When do you think you'll get leave again?
Her ballet recital is Saturday, don't forget.
Well, I guess she's more around your age... You guys could talk about things in common, like growing up in the fifties.
As if my dad could've stopped me from seeing you. What's he gonna do to me?
That was lovely.
I'll do anything for you.
It's no big deal, it just looks better carrying me. Oh, you mean because I wasn't carrying my purse at the time.
You want to go down or stay along the river?
You believe in it.
What is?
The hospital.
As much as ever. Nothing.
What happened to your big "assignment"?
No.
This is insane!
The hell I can't!
Bullshit! You don't need me! You've never needed me! I can't help you! Understand?! I have to get out.
Don't try to con me, Amado. You knew how they got all those things.
So I'm worried about you. I don't want you to end up in jail like your friends.
--you're going to be on your own.
I'm only going to have you for two more years. If you decide not to go on to college--
Benjamin.
You don't look it.
Why don't you watch?
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Will you bring me a hanger?
Please. That doesn't make you a nerd. Everyone wore those shoes.
Oh God, it's that bloody yank!
Excuse me.
I don't understand.
I'm going to marry him.
Yes. Do you want...
Like how?
LOOK! IT'S BRUCE!! Allies -- the balloons. We've got to find some way to tell him!
Yeh, sleepin'.
You're afraid to say.
You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute. I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself.
What are you thinking?
No, not here in Pennsylvania, she went to Russia undercover with her acting troupe and got a lot of highly sensitive secret plans sent back. Just when she was about to go home, she got caught, and they killed her.
That's simple. She was pregnant with me...when she went to Russia and she didn't know...and then when the Russians found out, they waited to shoot her 'cause you're not allowed to kill pregnant women anywhere in the world.
No-one invented gravity, it just exists.
Well...I'm not supposed to talk about it, but since I'm gonna write about it I might as well tell you. She was a spy against the Russians.
Not today, Burgel. Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
Which side are you with?
Uh, don't worry, I'm a very- a very good driver. So, listen-hey, you want some gum, anyway?
Wisconsin.
No, Chippewa Falls.
Well, I do commercials, sort of...
Oh, I'm in her acting class.
You go home.
Saw the sign outside. Got your own sign, huh?
You behave as though you want to fuck her.
See you over there, Miles.
I'm pregnant.
I don't want him to die, I didn't love him when we met, and I've done so many bad things to him that he doesn't know, things I want to confess to him, but now I do: I love him. I love him so much and I can't stand -- he's going.
Thank you, Greta. I'll be with Mr. Rand if I'm needed.
You have no idea what happened . . .
Oh, George, George!
Oh, George, George, George.
George, darling! Where have you been?
He's not even aware of it. When you've got his attention you feel like you're the only person in the world. That's why everybody loves him. Other times...
The thing with Dickie -- it's like the sun shines on you and it's glorious, then he forgets you and it's very very cold.
Tell me, why is it when men play they always play at killing each other...? I'm sorry about Cortina by the way.
It's always the same whenever someone new comes into his life -- Freddie, Fausto, Peter Smith-Kingsley -- he's wonderful -- did you meet him, he's a musician? -- ...and especially you, of course... and that's only the boys.
Didn't Dick say? -- He talked to Freddie... apparently it's not going to work out -- Freddie says there aren't enough rooms.
Buddy, it's not your fault, and it's not your decision.
I'm sorry. I was afraid something like this could happen.
Don't cross Gordon. He'll crush you. You've worked hard to get where you are. If Gordon doesn't buy Bluestar someone else will; and who's to say they won't do the same thing.
Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
...you think that's right...
Carla was in the car, right?
...Take advantage of me.
I don't think I'd be much good in a war...
I don't know. Not a war exactly. It's more a... a misapprehension maybe...
This is another one of your schemes to get me off alone...
I do.
Are those for me?
All right! Am I exceedingly dangerous now?
Then listen to me. You're both disgusting--with your pride, your pride. I hate you for coming here--like a federal marshal in a western film. I loved you when you stayed away. But here you are now--high noon in the Superbowl! You fool, you fool.
You fake! You're no better than the dumbest general in the Pentagon. You're not going to beat Harold. You're not going to beat anybody. You're not going to stay here, either--yammering and taunting until you're most gloriously killed. Go home!
Out!
Which brings me back to my original question. What was he doing here in the first place?
Do you think you'll find her?
You thought I was talking about getting married?!
That's right. We've got to bare it all. Here and now. 'Cause I think I'm finally ready to go for it...
Scott...
...the hell are you talking about?
I'm talking about me 'n' you stripping down on this beach and gettin' you know... 'naked in Tahiti'.
My cellmate would say she did her time for getting caught. She was always more honest than me.
Yes, it is.
Five years is a long time.
What?
The redistribution of wealth.
The redistribution of wealth?
Isn't that what you wanted to know? What I did time for?
I'm already in your bed.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.
You'll love them. We're going down to D.C. tonight to be with them Christmas morning.
I'm sure you'll be able to handle him.
Yeah yeah yeah... Just tell me your five main interests, in order of importance.
Let's just say "music" - that way you only use up one... Wait, we have to go in here for a second...
Hi Josh.
You can see me now.
Something wrong?
That bastard.
Sweetheart, it's a bore out there... let's lock the door.
George? Was he alone?
Well did he go in there with Jackie?
I like him a lot.
Unbelievable. This is a nightmare.
Dad, you and I have talked about this. Lloyd and I have talked about this. Believe me, this is well-covered territory.
A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
I figured he had a right to know.
Yes! That's right!
Yes, yes it is!
Just open the door.
You are sweet.
Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower.
Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment.
Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad.
I am sleepy.
Of course, he'll love it. You're a terrific artist.
You're saying that Christ is the child, and --
All well and good -- But tell me again what is it exactly that you believe in?
What?
Why not?
You're the moron that's been invading my turf?
Murphy kid turn you down?
Yes.
Oh, comedian. Yes. Oh, uh... you're on next.
I bet I know what changed your mind... ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me.
My brother said you were about to fire me.
I beg you, Donatien... as your wife... your only ally... you must stop making such a monstrous spectacle of yourself.
-- you've been a tremendous help to me.
Close the door, Raymond.
Is this something you're interested in? I'm not really that person I was.
Forgive me, I beg you --
Yes. I had thought that... I was loathsome to you. Perhaps I am. If I may be excused, M'lord.
He's my brother.
Michael Meyers.
I was trying to get away from someone.
I'm going back tomorrow.
Afraid not. You can pick your friends, but you can't pick your family.
It's strip reality, actually, like what the pilots always want to play.
I like to play "reality".
You're Nick's mother?
What ever happened to a good old-fashioned favor huh?
Yeah, well he left out a couple of steps, ah look, I've gotta get back to these bills, Phil will you help Vada get settled?
I sit. I think. I play games.
Two and a half days?
What are you saying?
Charles.
You've sacrificed?! If you'd practice law for decent folk instead of Communists and indigents --
You're poisoning that child's mind.
And you... should be proud. You won that contest and made a name for yourself.
That's right. I can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.
How? What do they do for you, Kaminski and his friends? They're all anarchists! Traitors!
Good.
Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders?
Well, you've been getting a pretty low salary here in New York. It seems to me that the new dramatic critic of our Chicago paper should get what he's worth.
Louise.
Louise, this young man is on his way back to school and needs a ride, and I thought since...
It's probably not a good idea.
Well, don't make him disappear before I see him.
I'd like that very much.
Nothing.
Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!!
Yes, go on.
I'm taking up the situation with you now...
Do I have to spell it out?
Well, it doesn't matter anyhow-- because we're moving.
Jimmy, you're very young--and a foolish decision now could wreck your whole life.
Seventy-two miles an hour.
Good night...
Yes, I understand.
Yes. I looked. I remember clearly now. It seemed we were going too fast down the hill. I was scared.
The speedometer. And it was downhill there.
I've been all right.
You left me at the hospital.
You can't do that.
So here we go.
He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
Claire.
I found Dickie's rings.
Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
No you're not!
He's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town...
Yeah? You know if you would have said so in the beginning, you would have saved yourself a whole lot of trouble.
You would have looked better.
What's left of my blood.
You never told me why you got kicked out of...
An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said.
Jeez... Adele!
What's she like?
Well, what's nice about her? Tell us!
Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day.
I'm positive.
I need to know that.
Big talk.
Llewelyn!
Mother, may I introduce Jack Dawson.
So what went wrong?
Morning!
Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
I'd like to mention a few names, who...
And I take this opportunity to suggest that, equally, I admit to nothing, and that I would like my lawyer present.
Mine.
I know it. What do you want, Robert?
Will you keep feeding me? How long can you live like that? Until it kills you? Until I kill you? Without your blood I'll go back.
You know what I mean.
Is this the same stuff you made last week?
...and open the French doors and go on the balcony --
I hope it tastes better than the other stuff.
Any sign of Sounder?
Oh, it's just so romantic. I just want to put on a long gown...
And these roses. They're much prettier up close.
Great.
It feels like you're in France.
So are you really friends with Andy? He seems like such a weirdo.
Don't you think he's using you?
So. Are you ready? I start Columbia next fall. Of course, there's like, a year of pre-med stuff, but whatever. I'm really excited. And: Rene gave me a job as his secretary. His poems are getting published.
Pretty much the same.
Sure.
You don't have to wait, daddy'll be mad if you're late.
Like a New Year's Day hangover.
Well, I guess you found my secret hiding place.
Bye. Well Miss Vada, what d'you say we head back?
Yeah.
Nothing in particular, just putting it away for a rainy day.
The Head Man's writing a Bill.
Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm surprised at you, Mister McGann--
Thanks very much.
I wouldn't wait if I were you.
It's French, though. It really is.
The first... What? Six or seven times I went in. Remember what happened?
Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and...
Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps?
I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now?
Thank you so much for accompanying me.
Yeah.
Samuel. Samuel Lapp. But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon.
Come here, Duff. No point running away from coincidence.
Good.
Thanks.
I suppose.
I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath. Look at me, Laurel, look at me. I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world! How do I look?
You sent my assistant on an errand.
Give me some credit, will you?
From all I can get the Sheriff let him out so's he could vote for him.
It cost me four hundred and fifty bucks to tear it out of Cooley.
Never mind it? That's not my money! That's Bruce's money!
You don't understand that do you?
Wonder. Beauty. Joy. Love.
I don't know. A lot.
Isn't that my drink?
No.
I'm sure. Pretty sure.
Please -- just let me sleep.
I'm so tired -- DR. DREYFUSS Here -- drink this.
You don't know the procedure.
They won't...
What assholes.
How come you never ask me any important questions? Don't you wonder if there's going to be a nuclear war? Or a cure for cancer? What about your family? What about people?
Did you ever go I one?
Were you a disco guy?
C'mon, don't lie.
Where were you?
With Ordell?
Murder one! God, Louise, can't we even say it was self-defense?
Oh, come on! Murder one and armed robbery, Thelma!
Jeez, Louise, tapped the phone? You think so?
To find out if he knows anything. If you think he does, you gotta hang up because it means the police have told him and the phone is probably tapped.
What for?
I want you to call Darryl.
Yeah.
Thelma.
You know he hated my story also.
No, she threw you out. What a difficult woman.
Yeah. It's just... something I gotta do, I guess.
I know. Don't tell anyone.
I got your number, Mister Man.
Well, who have we here...?
Frances, you remember my lawyer, Alma Styles?
Yeah.
Buddy... does Rose really... "do it" with all those boys and men?
I'll talk to her, I'll reason with her.
I bet we can fix it.
Sixty forty.
WHAT'S THIS? WHAT'S THIS? GOD DAMN BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT. DON'T PUT THOSE --
This isn't your responsibility. Remember that. Don't let them use guilt as a tool. If you want to stop, say so.
M'hm.
M'hm. Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah.
Oh! Italian, right?
Oh, yeah.
What.
Thought you wrote you had a mustache.
No, no, no. Be like you want to be.
Saw me --
You are to me.
If he were only that. The man's evil himself. Some day you'll know him as MacFarlane knows him -- for MacFarlane he was to Knox as you are to him. That brought him close to Gray, he roistered with him and drank with him. Aye, and Gray even brought him to my door and my love. There is all that between them and more -- Burke and Hare and Knox --
He could have been a great man -- a good man and a fine doctor, but there was always the shame of the old life and the old ways to hold him back -- and always Gray -- Gray to hound him to his death.
Is it a great man whom Gray can order to his bidding? Is it a great man who for very shame dare not acknowledge his own wife so that I must play maidservant for the world's sake and his success?
Save yourself. Master Fettes look at MacFarlane and be warned.
I am not a wealthy woman.
How am I going to be the progenitor of a tribe when I'm living on an isolated ridgetop with Delores?
We should talk alone.
I don't think so.
What's going on?
Oh God, Lenny. I was trying to keep you out of this.
It's tainted money, Doctor.
Love.
-- Maybe she'll come with us. If I tell her how important it is to me, I don't think she'll mind. Do you?
Except for last Thursday when Rachel forgot to pick them up --
Goodnight, John.
What's that?
Is anything missing?
After you got knocked up, my mother didn't want me to talk to you. She thought it was contagious.
Don't be so sure it's my last. There are a few people back home I'd like to put under a red hot iron.
What?
John?
Have you ever felt so completely consumed by a feeling for someone that you couldn't breathe? That the time together is so passionate and consuming that you felt physical pain when they would leave?
-- Numbers, and I don't need to place myself in that kind of position.
Nummers.
And what?
I would not be too sure.
No. It's useless, Robert. It wouldn't work, not ever...
He's a reality television producer. His name is Mark Weiss.
Morning.
Well, I, my most unabominable snowman, have been impressed by you. In fact I propose a pairing. So I'm here to set you free.
You're implying that the whole selection process is a sham?
This... seemed best.
Oh yes, I remember you.
Okay, gotcha. What did you think I was going to ask?
Melvin... I'd like to know exactly where we are going.
Yes.
Viktor, do you realize you always do that?
Are you and Simone... ... getting married?
Well, yes. From a studio point of view, it would be better if Simone stayed single. Anyhow, I thought she came across great tonight. Intelligent, well informed, a natural. And touching. She was spectacular.
And who's Lydia?
Yes, you do... Anyway, tonight was a good start.
Lift me down.
Nothing.
No... Lester likes it on all the time in case he wants to use it.
You think he killed her?
Good-night.
Yes, he's fine, too. You saw them at Easter.
I guess she's busy.
But you're wrong. I do know you, at least by reputation. Edward Bloom from Ashton. See, I'm actually engaged to a boy from Ashton. Don Price. He was a few years older than you.
That's just so embarrassing.
What?
You told me to change.
Where'd you get that... ?
Where'd you get that gun?
That gun. That... that's not automatic. The guard had an automatic...
She did? I love her so much, and I haven't seen her in such a long time. And Grandpa Barney. Is he all, right?
Ssh. He's great.
You can hardly get your arms around me. How depressing. You're so early.
Aw... that's so sweet.
Do you want to-
No, you won't. You'll die of cold out there and then I'll have to feel guilty. And I've already got more guilt than I know what to do with. Do you want something to drink?
Where are you going? You'll freeze out there. You don't even have a coat.
You know what? It's Christmas Eve. And you look clean -- I mean, you're normal-looking. It's Christmas Eve, and I have a couch.
McCool's that same rank. We're both j.g.'s.
But... You may not be well enough.
I don't believe it! You're lying!
Surest thing you know.
I... I never lied!
Sure, sure, just the money, and the aristocratic pleasure of seeing him fall apart. You're a Roman, Bert. You have to win them all.
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.
I don't want to go back.
You're also an idiot.
I'm glad you came to me for help.
Just like old times.
You're not protecting the world, you're obstructing progress!
As soon as I saw you loved me, I was pleased, and I gave you every opportunity to fall more in love with me, being certain that, for my part, I would never love you. But after our first kiss, I found that I had no power over myself. I did not know that one kiss could matter so much.
C'mon.
What happens if you lose?
No, Mikey.
Sandy, you scared the shit out of me.
Mm-mm.
A Porsche.
Quien es?
Yeah. So, what about you?
It's ok. It's ok. Relax. It's just a cut. We can get it fixed. But we need to get you to the hospital now. How'd you get that?
Can I look at the pictures?
Don't you open them anymore?
Somewhere else. I've never been anywhere else. Just once. Years ago. Went to the state fair. It was nice, but it wasn't nothing.
I...1 would like to...thank you, Mister Wat... Gene.
Leonard. What my daughter is on about, Mr Lombard, is that Leonard is somewhat of a Bohemian. You might as well know that...
Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
Yes. Do you mind?
And she waited here for him?
I left early because I wasn't feeling very well.
Hm hmm.
Fish... ... brussel sprouts.
Hm hmm. What did you have for dinner?
I ate.
Oh don't be, I'm here. It's alright. I want you to tell me what you did before you went to bed.
We went to chapel for vespers.
And then what happened?
I hate them.
You don't like brussel sprouts?
Yes. Like the quiche.
I thought real men don't like quiche.
Hi.
Hi, Mike. I'm Lorraine.
Why? You're not a real man?
Open it.
You son Thomas and Virginia, they come to my house this afternoon...
Who?
Your son Thomas and his wife Virginia...
When was this?
What they say?
You know what they say. They say things are no good in this house. Catherine, your son is married. Leave him in peace. He wantsa be alone with his wife. They don't want no old lady sitting inna balcony. Now I tell you what I think. I want you come live with me in my house with Marty and me. In my house, you have your own room. You don't have to sleep onna couch inna living room like here. We will cook inna kitchen and talk like when we were girls. You are dear to me, and you are dear to Marty. We are pleased for you to come.
Catherine, don't make an opera outta this. The three-a you anna baby live in three skinny rooms. You are an old goat, and she has an Italian temper. She is a good girl, but you drive her crazy. Catherine, you are no fool. You know this is no good, an old woman living with a husband and wife. Two women inna same kitchen, anna house burns down.
So I am an old garbage bag, put inna street.
No no, I'm fine, really...
I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
I thought for ol' Cliff here -- Look at you? You're more adorable than your pictures. Look what I got for you.
Beautiful.
Well, why not? Hey, what is this? My life's rushing in front of my eyes.
Sit still. It's not finished -
You don't know how to love.
Sure. I'll join the crowd.
What did you think of the music?
Did you know? Had you heard?
The marriage!
How was I? Tell me honestly.
Nothing! He can marry who he pleases. I don't give a damn.
The sun.
Awright. How's our girl doin', anyway?
-- and now I got reporters from Toadsquat, Iowa, calling my office and askin' what I know about this "G.I. Jane" thing.
Commander, are you of the habit of letting photographers traipse around your base snappin' their fill? These were supposed to have been discreet test cases --
Well, seein's how this thing is out, you let me handle the r.p.m. From this point forward, I want all press matters coordinated via my office. I'll be god-damned if I'm gonna watch Hayes pull flowers out of his ass and take credit for this one. Him or the President. This my shade? "Midnight Mahogany"? 'Cuz I'm comin' dangerously close to lookin' like Ronald Reagan here.
See me, sir?
Are you truly mouthin' off to a senior member of the Senate Arms Committee? I mean, I'll give you points for style -- just nothin' for smarts.
I'm sorry, I don't recall meeting anyone who fits that description.
Yeah?
Oh Will! I was wondering when you'd call.
Branding? I haven't branded in years.
I'll come.
Uh, I don't, honey. Branding? Oooh... I think we'd just be in Mr. Booker's way.
Now could she just...forget me!
No I didn't see anybody I know. No I don't want to go to school here tomorrow. I want to go home.
No.
I don't want to be here. Don't worry, I love you, Daddy, I do. But I want to go home.
Oh, you know what. I'm suffocating!
No. We can't can't go on this way. We can't go back to the old way either.
What would we do if a German came into the house?
Because you're leaning? No, you're just on an angle. You're too heavy!
He can't even move.
Half the time he's bluffing.
He always knows.
Objection!
There were some shots.
Are you afraid of me?
I'm tough, Creasy. I'm tough as you.
The gunshot holds no fear.
Because I like you.
Well, Mary, you're about as helpful as a broken sewer pipe. You do know what runs out of a sewer pipe, don't you?
Hey, there.
Something was just missing.
Why do you keep asking me that?
It's a trip, you know? When you're a kid, you see the life you want, and it never crosses your mind that it's not gonna turn out that way.
I get it!
Let me get at that typewriter and I'll show you how a doll-faced mugg can write!
Whoa -- wait a minute. We can't leave Williams here. One of the other fellows'll --
That one -- how you gonna take him? They'll see him.
You can't take that desk out. It's crawling with cops outside.
I love you, Norm.
Oh, please, it was long over by then. God damn, he made me look like some cheap --
You've... found it. What could I possibly have that you would want, Mr. Hadden?
I'm sorry. I thought I was to be the light. But why do I confuse you? Am I so strange?
I don't care to meet anybody until I get paid--come on--come on. One dollar each, please, for the Milk Fund.
That . . .
I'm so glad.
I'm sure of it. Just as I'm sure there's a wish for Shangri-La in everyone's heart. I have never seen the outside world. But I understand there are millions and millions of people who are supposed to be mean and greedy. Yet I just know that secretly they are all hoping to find a garden spot where there is peace and security, where there's beauty and comfort, where they wouldn't have to be mean and greedy. Oh, I just wish the whole world might come to this valley.
Oh!
Oh, Walter. I don't deserve you.
You okay?
I'm not at the top of the Empire State Building. I'm here.
No.
Jammer saw something in there, something that scared the hell out him--
But what did he see that made him panic?
I don't know. I DON'T KNOW!
Well, a suit. There's one I had my eye on.
Are you humoring me?
I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
What you heard wasn't sex.
What the fuck was it?
All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
What was it then?
I don't need pills... just sleep.
I'm sure. Thank you all the same.
Charlie, I thought I knew everything about you.
You look awful, like you haven't slept in days. And so old.
Charlie? Was I dead?
Oh, don't be a grump.
Me? Us! The party at Nirdlinger's--I told you last week, for the Christmas Push.
What about Janet?
Yes.
Yes.
Sure.
As appealing as that sounds...
You said we would be safe in Philadelphia.
No...I need to sleep.
But, this could be serious.
Right now, before I back down.
Ooka.
Oook. Oook.
All right, but...I'm going to check on you.
I don't know! I don't know either!
What?
Okay.
George, he wasn't asking.
Well, I got a call from Pablo. He said this thing with Diego is a disaster. He's giving up lab locations, names, bank accounts, he was very pissed off. Pablo said to take him down. His exact words were "Fuck Diego."
You look adorable.
Matt, come here!
Just so you know, I think they recalled these cars in 1974.
Hey, Josie, how are you at Calculus?
Sure. No problem.
And so you did your job, right?
Come here, honey!
If I lose, I'll buy you a wedding present.
It was magnificent, man!
That's right. There's no place left to go is there, James?
Good night, Mom.
Och, you do, Fergie.
Yeah?
I need it.
What kind of stupid question is that?!
We had a deal. Remember that? He said if it didn't work out between us, that I could get my things and I could leave.
And what was he doing here in the first place? That's what I want to know. What's a man like you messing around with a black boy like Thomas for? Are you some kind of pervert, or what?
Don't give me any of that. I know he's been here. You can't fool me, mister.
Thomas Cole. Thomas Jefferson Cole. My nephew.
He wants to talk to you.
Landon. You have two parents. We're both here for you even --
... What?... You don't want to commute?
... I would love to start looking at least. You know, maybe a two bedroom or even, maybe the top floor of a house -- like in Brooklyn or Staten Island...
You awake?
Well, let me know when you figure it out.
He said they're charging us with murder.
I know. I know what you mean. I don't wanna end up on the damn Geraldo Show.
And we have to decide whether we want to come out of this dead or alive.
Eeuww.
Louise, do you think we should change cars, get another car?
Gosh, didn't he say anything positive at all?
No.
Sure... You know how to hotwire a car?
Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside.
It was the owl--come to bed
Then why are you so upset?
You would not leave me?
Moonlight!
Even your play.
And that was only my first try.
What? Ah... yes, yes, I see what you mean... Yes... so, you'll be responsible then?
The woman who left that message for you sounded very disturbed. I think she was crying...
Oh... yes... yes... This terrible war. When will it end?
Well, certainly... We're always happy to cooperate with the police...
Well, uh. She didn't say Mr. Duke. But since I know you're here with the Police Convention...
Alone?
I don't know. Please...
I'll play you.
Thank you.
I do seem to be... Maybe because I'm just a little bit terrified about tomorrow.
Well you can try, can't you, to be good?
Yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. Not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. But... they were still attached to God. Agnes has that birth. No more... we're born, we live, we die. No room for miracles. Oh my dear, how I miss the miracles.
Do you want to become one?
Do you think they ever existed?
Yes I do.
Right. What do you suppose today's saints are smoking?
There are no saints today. Good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those I'm afraid we are sorely lacking.
Oh, you've come a long way baby.
And Saint John would chew tobacco.
Good. 'Cause I'm enjoying myself.
Whatever the reason, I m sorry I did. Goodbye, Mr Lombard. I believe you know your way out.
Have you finished?
Hello?
What?
Juno, what's the matter?
I'm not crying. I'm allergic to fine home furnishings. See you later.
What are you referring to?
You couldn't wait until morning?
Thanks for coming to get me.
This is a nice car.
I can't hear you.
Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him.
No.
Huh! Don t you recall convincing me he had? You should learn to live with your mistakes, Mr Lombard. There is some merit in it.
I've missed you.
I read George Jean Nathan every week.
He looked old, didn't he?
The colored vote happens to be very important to the Mayor of this town.
If he's nuts, why doesn't the State just put him away?
Hello?
Yeah?
Maybe she didn't feel like she should have to. Maybe she felt like if you'd been paying any real attention to her to start with, maybe you would've noticed.
Oh for shit's sake, Ted, you are the most selfish human being I have ever met. No wonder she said you came first, then Billy, then, if there was anything left over, she got the scraps.
What d'you know about how Joanna felt? You went off to an office every morning and you'd come dragging home at seven or eight every night and as long as dinner was on the table you thought everything was swell.
No.
I don't know. You can never be sure with Vaughan. This is his show.
It's your car but I don't want to hear it. If that means anything.
Let me see... Ahh, gorgeous!
I don't want to hear that music right now.
I don't.
Uh-huh. You said you wanted fireworks.
Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear?
I'm so happy to see you!
I once vowed never to invest too much emotion into anyone, anything.
Please, it's Lisa... I'll be coming with you tomorrow. I have lunch with friends.
It makes it all seem so serious.
No, you're right. You were hired to protect her, that's enough. I'm confident you'll do that.
What are you going to do?
It might save some of the pieces, Jeff. It would leave a doubt about the whole thing--about you. Might blow over, this way.
I'm not.
No. That night--I--well, you know-- I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort of brother, that's all--
Well, I guess it's a chance.
...You can sleep, hon. It's early yet.
Yah.
Your job isn't to give Mrs. Kane your opinion of her talents. You're supposed to train her voice. Nothing more.
He was in love with me. But he never told me so until after it all came out in the papers about us - and he lost the election and that Norton woman divorced him.
He wanted me to be comfortable - Oh, why should I bother? You don't believe me, but it's true. It just happens to be true. He was really interested in my voice. What are you smiling for? What do you think he built that opera house for? I didn't want it. I didn't want to sing. It was his idea - everything was his idea - except my leaving him.
What do you mean?
Yah, ya know we've got the big statue there. So you haven't had any vehicles go missing, then?
...Mr. Lundegaard?
Champagne on the rocks. Oh-could I have that with a twist? She starts to sink back in her chair and Bateman leans over and pulls her back up.
You smell weird.
What do you want me to do?
There's a lot I haven't done with a man before.
She's not a psychic. Just a very enlightened spirit.
Thanks, but I'm fine.
It soothes heart-ache and promotes psychic wellness. Sela suggested I bring--
Yep.
It's niiice.
So you'll have some later. Notice anything...different?
Beautiful thing, alimony. Lose a husband, get a car. Think it'll help me pick up dudes?
Oh yes, Major, I have recordings of all his symphonies. I kept them safe during the bombing. My favourite is the Seventh Symphony.
You're late, George.
Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with.
It's from hunger.
Schaefer. Betty Schaefer. And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me.
Who's Spalding?
I don't.
Yeah, an honest tramp-ass ho. But I guess you'll stick your dick in anything.
And? She's not saying, "I think you're a nice guy and I wanna get to know you better," she's saying, "I wanna bone."
She's a ho cause she's sending her coochie through the mail.
If this was my office, I wouldn't keep that closed.
Oh no.
I never met my mother.
My mother.
Then Grammoo said on Christmas Eve, there was this sickening smell permeating the entire house.
No.
-- how you -- how anyone -- could do a thing like that.
Not much, really. Caesar was nervous, kept cleaning the apartment. The first time, he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.
Is that the kind of girl you think I am? What can I do to make you relax?
Does Johnnie hit on you?
I can't move. I can't get out.
Yes.
Please don't move me. It hurts too much.
If he says that's what happened, Jake, it must be true.
Then - would you talk to Mr. Fabian about it?
Look! Either you talk or the creeps are gonna walk. For god s sake. What am I supposed to say? I got this from a French guy from England who broke in there to have a chat with an Austrian child trafficker? Is that it?
Why are you taking this out on him?
We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer.
You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
It's me?
For a second there I thought you were a fanatic.
And what was that explanation?
Is this a religious thing?
I don't let anybody call me that.
Well, personally, I never went for church names.
A good lay.
You sold your soul, remember? That's what you told me.
The best.
So where is the lamb?
What for?
What for Paul.
Where the fuck do you think you're going?
Yeah, can you believe it?
Well, I mean, why not? You know, wh-what have I got to lose? Uh...
Really?
You found all this, all this out on one date?
...he's really paid his dues, but...then she helped put him through architecture school, you know, so...
I've got a singing audition for a Broadway musical. Of course, I'll never get it.
Well, I think he was dying to open up. It's so sad. Now...what should I wear to my audition?
Well, you think everybody in m- musicals sings so well?
Well, no...I-I know, I just, uh... No, I-I, eh, you know, I, I didn't, I didn't know you sung.
Wait, uh, I, I don't understand. Start again -- He's alive...
Diane Court doesn't go out with guys like you. She's a brain.
What?
Brains stay with brains. The bomb could go off and their mutant genes would form the same cliques.
No, not at all. Actually, I don't think John likes him much anymore. He said he thought Graham had gotten strange.
Is he? Strange, I mean?
What's lucky about that?
Daddy, I'd like to be in that Wally's shoes every night.
Let's go, Lainey. There's nothing here.
Be good and be smart, little boy.
I'll see you at National.
Ah.
Like Joe.
No, thank you.
You don't believe in anything do you, Bobby?
He's a novelist.
I'm sorry. Slip of the tongue.
And that's the part of Harry that's being manifested.
Why would Harry go back to using a code?
Jerry. Right. I said Jerry, didn't I?
What?
Yes -- which is why "quiet, dependable people" have to take charge of their own lives.
You think what we're doing is so wrong? And what are you doing? Pursuing goodness? For what? To answer to some supreme tribunal?
I trusted you. I stood up in court five years ago and I picked you.
Okay.
You let me believe you. You knew you were guilty, and you let me become a part of it. God, how... how could you...
No, but you stole from them.
Now, Thelma, that is not...
Boy, he wasn't expectin' that!
What?! What about him?!
Just the look on his face when you... ... it's not funny.
What?!
Harlan.
What? What's not funny, Thelma!
What?
Nothing. It's not funny.
You stole from them, you lied to me. How do you think that's supposed to make me feel?
No. I want to know.
You must have been dreaming.
Look at the guy! He just saved fifty people. Now he's going to disappear. Who is he?
Okay then, you're crazy.
You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
I thought you were enjoying yourself?
How else was I going to get you here? I haven't seen you in a week.
Come in then.
What took you so long? Is it hot?
It's still just death, the absence of life--no honor at all. It's worse than the blue soup by far-- that nothingness. To you, though, it's the honor that crowns them all.
Honor, I suppose.
But it's all balled up in your head with death. The highest honor is death. When you talk of these animals, one by one, you don't just talk of killing them. You honored them with death. Harold--it is not honor to be killed.
Don't turn us out, Abbe.
Would I be the only one? The only woman?
Yes, dear.
So did I. I figured when the time got right, we could all take a day or two and walk up there, but it's not the kind of long trip for a child to take alone.
There'll be more to follow -- but yes, dear, right now you're the pick of a very large litter. And your success would mean a lot. Jumping, now...
Captain Dwyer. Technically.
This is just a test case, O'Neil. But if it works out -- if you work out -- it could well change the Navy's official policy on women in combat. Or, actually, its official non-policy. Now who's your immediate superior there?
It's a sin against God for me to refuse your kindness. But my heart's held fast here...
My office will fill him in and help expedite. Look forward to meeting you at the proper time. Jumping off now...
I was there, I saw her do it.
What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong?
Give me fifty bucks and they're all yours.
It's okay. We broke up.
Just now.
I know what they're worth. Give me fifty and get them out.
Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
And her...?
How's everything, Gus?
I suppose I can't call this off without creating a scene -- but remember, it's your last fling.
Hey? What did I tell you? Why don't you come? It's just dinner. You'll have something to tell your mother next time she calls.
Never... never... never!
I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John.
I suppose so.
Huh.
Thanks for calling.
You're back.
You fucked with me for the last time!
You want to take your bath? We have to get up early tomorrow. You may not have enough time to --
But?... But? There is a "but," Nathan.
Not in front of the boy.
Stop. Get away.
You have to choose Nathan. It's like Sophie's choice. Only it is Nathan's choice. Did you ever see that movie, Sophie's Choice? It is like that. Only it is this.
No! It is now that you must decide. I love you, Doctor Nathan... ...but I will not wait. I will not be your chippy. I will not be your little Mademoiselle Parlez-vous side dish. My love. I want to have a sweet tiny baby inside my belly... from you.
I was at Lena's last night. You were terrific.
No, I'm just not that hungry.
He alive to see this?
Only in the movies.
Stick with me, kid. Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes.
What about your grandmother?
Really?
Where s my real dad?
I asked Odette to take a look at little Anais. She has a rash.
Yes, with Fedens and the children.
You still didn't answer my question.
They did a pretty good job.
Oh, he's fine. He's-he's, I guess he's fine. I don't know. He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months.
Mike! You have a mess on C-9!
Get going.
Gay.
Good morning, Gentlemen. Please be seated. I see we're still dressing in the dark, Eugene.
Precisely what you're paid to prevent.
Virus?
Right.
I love you, Harry. I love you.
Do you mind? I'm-I'm my own person.
I'm sorry, are you saying that if this thing goes to trial, it'll be ten years before these plaintiffs see their money?
Get Dr. Corey.
Thank you. I can't imagine how Mrs. Kane came to make such a silly mistake. The sedative Dr. Wagner gave her is in a somewhat larger bottle - I suppose the strain of preparing for her trip has excited and confused her.
There are no objections to my staying here with her, are there?
No, I didn't...
I'm sorry, Mike.
It sounds like you're doin' really super.
It was just a voice.
They ran away.
What brings the rats out of the sewers?
Okay.
If there ever was a devil in this county, Ike, you is it!
Just to see if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
So unbolt the fucking door, Einstein.
We could call anonymously from a pay phone... just to see if there was an accident.
No.... I don't...
Give it to me.
How are you?.... Oh, I'm Mrs. Jorgensen now.... No, she isn't here. Is it about her father? Well, can I take the message?
Dad, I'm trying. The chairs, they won't scrunch.
Then I'll throw up a little bit.
Hi, Mr Crane.
Oh, in there? I messed up a little bit in the scherzo. I guess, if nobody noticed, it's OK. Mr Crane, this is Tony, a friend of mine. Tony, Mr Crane.
Eh, Mickey, it's getting late.
Mulholland Drive?
How will I get back to Baltimore Saturday? Oh God, I forgot my present for your stepmother -- I took it inside by accident.
Don't be silly. I'll just be ten minutes behind you.
Even when you were young?
What happened to Sam?
Yes, probably... maybe...
No, of course not... I never killed anyone...
No! I warned the English to go back home -- I begged them not to force us to fight -- they knew the defeat I would bring on them... why didn't they listen to me?
And so I... I prefer my banner.
To avoid killing anyone.
I didn't learn Arabic because we were getting shipped here. You don't learn it in a couple of weeks. I studied it in high school.
As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
No, why?
He's Black, OK?
First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
He's dead.
I thought so.
Well, listen to this. He got mad at me one day. Boy, did he get mad at me. He took the light bulb, ya know. I thought he was going to cram it right up me, ya know. But he ate it. He ate the whole fucking light bulb. Now, tell me! Is he crazy? Tell me! Is he crazy?
Yeah, well, I'll tell ya somethin'. I'll tell ya somethin'. I had this boyfriend, Chuck. Ya know him, Mac. Ya remember, Chuck.
That's what I told his mother. And she said I was crazy. Her son ate the whole fucking light bulb and she said I was crazy.
But you will bring it down if you kill Leo Crow. Why, that will be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime... didn't work.
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the mother and father of Precrime. Well, in my experience, parents often see their children as they want them to be, not as they are.
Do you? Really?
The system would collapse.
I'm glad you came. I'm sorry about the precautions.
Jim Garrison?
I could give you a false name, but I won't. Just call me X.
Jody and I. And she was there, Norman, she was. It scared Jody so bad she had to leave.
Jody brought a Ouija board and we summoned her.
No one's asking you not to work. I just think you could make some time for your son.
Not true.
What are you doing here?
That's an interesting piece of news.
Not even Mutual of Omaha thinks so anymore.
OK, the press call you the WHITE ANGLE because you only kill girls wearing white - why white - white clothes, blonde hair...
Don't talk like that!
Mm-hm.
Point out all the lies and fucked-up thinking.
Bob?
Is this a bad time?
You know the joke: a Jew's shipwrecked on a desert island. When they rescue him, they see he's built two synagogues. They say, for vhat do you need two synagogues? He says, vun to pray in, and vun I'd never set foot in so long as I live, so help me God. You pray in the one you'd never set foot in...and vice versa.
Thank you, Bobby.
You did.
Out where?
About a year and a half.
Oh. Michael's 17 and Carolyn's 16.
And how long are you here for?
My husband took the kids to the Illinos State Fair. My daughter's entering a prize steer.
I'd like to, thanks.
I don't understa-
What's the matter, honey? Gonna miss Pilgrim?
Tom's gone.
Well... honey... you know... that's just not his way. Maybe you can write him a letter or something. Say thank you... Don't think about it... You take care and I'll see you home.
Could you give me a ride?
Everything.
I'll wait there.
Really?
A casa de Porfirio Zayas. He used to be a doctor on the other side. Gunshot wounds, fixing babies--if you can pay he can handle it.
How awful. What will you do?
Oh really?
Not at all. I was thoroughly enjoying by book. Please. Signor D'Agostino, Herr Bermann.
I can't.
-- well, more than anything else -- -- I'd like to suck his cock.
That's very sweet of you, Mr. Roth.
Okay. In that case... I'm at the airport in Nice.
You bastard...
How?
Trust me ...
It's s'posed to happen, Biff.
How 'bout some Marshmallow Rice Squares?
No!
No!
No! Stop it!
You win. It's--Clarissa.
Now, Susan --that's really a pretty name--
Sam.
Just wait here?
Ready for dinner, Brad?
Re-figure it, Mr. Bernstein, at two cents.
It's a saying, Mr. Bernstein. A new broom sweeps clean.
Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know.
Funny. I thought that's exactly what you did. You just don't have the courage to admit it to yourself.
I don't know, Nathan. What are you supposed to do?
Please, Nathan. I really need this. You've been working late a lot.
Can we look around in your camper?
Sure. I'll give you the royal tour.
Hi.
Harry, I really think she.....
Uh huh.
So what now?
You know, you never told me why you left the army.
For what?
Rob's?
Barton, I think we should concentrate on OUR little project-
You'd heard of AIDS in 1984, 85?
And I thought I was weird.
Well, the basic ideas were frequently his-
Why?
Hi. Why ain't you at the store?
While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
I wish I was your wife. I wish I had your kids.
No you're right. Once again. You're a decent man, Howard.
Look, I'm just going to come right out and tell you why I'm here, okay?
Hi.
But they'll be worried about me -- my brother-in-law may be calling the police --
They had to pump it out.
I can't talk you into it?
Thanks for reminding me.
Actually, I'm more interested in the man behind the wheel more than the manufacturer. So what is it that you have that makes you a materialistic fool ?
Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
Yahoo !!!!!
It's not fair ... I should be there with them. After all, I'm the one who got the women the vote.
It's -- different, Jabez -- that's all.
Daniel, you ought to be in bed.
Can't you see? She just wanted her little girl back.
I know... I do, too...
The drowning woman. Anne... But it was too late. Her little girl was already gone.
...That's not what I meant.
Aren't you coming back with me?
This is a mistake. No. This is a disaster.
I can't...
It's a surprise.
Monthly! God, how shallow do you think Brad is? Why do I waste my time telling you this stuff?
How's everything at the apartment?
Well. It's good to see you.
I'm sorry. It's these soft shoes I wear for my back.
I'm standing most of my day. They're for support. Didn't see you in church this mornin'.
Lazarus?
Well? What'd you think?
How'd I look?
I know. I know that. Don't spoil it.
I love you, you're a genius.
I adore him.
Lovely.
Fantastic. Out here.
Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled.
That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die.
Never again, never again...
I've got to go ...
No, Jesus, no.
She's crying.
It s ten thirty, Jack. By eleven you re gonna be sprawled out on the bed snoring your head off. We don t have time for wining and dining.
What?
Yeah?
Yeah, you know something? I never even took a lesson, either.
No, I'm gonna quit!
Really, do you think so, really?
It was incredible. He came back, made a pompous little bow and said, 'My dear girl you may film me all afternoon if you wish.' And he's promised not to talk to the Press.
I won't let 'em, Nick. They won't hurt you anymore.
When is that, George?
Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
James, you don't know what you are talking about. Quit trying to hold on so tight. I'm gone... long gone like a turkey through the corn.
Are you okay?
Well, go get 'em, Pops.
Hello, John.
Did you know twenty-six members of your rifle company are coming?
From the Korean War.
Whatever it was, they'll be here. We sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included -- the RSVP's are amazing. A few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course --
Cos she loves you.
I don't recall.
Thanks for your help.
Dade.
Yes. We've all got to let go.
He didn't used to be cheap. He thinks if he holds on to his money, he will never die.
And who's gonna pay for that?
Pop.
Real is overrated.
Yes.
Yes.
Let go of me or I'll scream, I'll call the police.
Let go of me.
I'd like you to leave now.
Hey Gus--did you see the story idea I left on your desk?
Maybe they are. Maybe this is all part of the package. The building of the machine has demanded international cooperation on an unprecedented scale. Maybe requiring us to come together in this way was, in effect, part of the plan.
... I can't believe they wouldn't take something as basic as our biological needs into account...
Cal...
Yes you are. A guy. Guy. Quite a guy. Oh my. Look at that--I rhymed. Yikes. Bikes!
I'm six months pregnant. I won't do it.
No, you do it. I can't sing.
To the mine?
I can't believe it!
Yeah?
What's going on now? What's he doing?
It's obviously him!
I figured something like that...
Won't you step into my office, Mr. Thatcher?
I rather like it myself. Send it right away.
So far. But that place is a pig sty. I wouldn't be surprised if there's more.
There's no way a son of mine hates Funky Town. It's impossible.
Ten. There's a lot of other places I could work.
What?
What are you doing here?
Wrong, Dad. Your idea.
Charlie. I just had the strangest dream.
We've got to move fast. This is an idea whose time has come.
You need a partner. There's a friend of mine at school whose father makes seat covers for cars, Mr. Fitzsimmons. I've invited him and his family over for dinner tomorrow night.
Isn't that awfully forward?
Tch, oh, what do you get out of me, anyway? I mean... it's not sexual anymore. It's certainly not intellectual. I mean, you're so superior to me in every way that--
Fifteen minutes?
What?
I'm not sure...
What...? 0h, yes.
I knew we'd pay for it.
...My books used to be perfect. Anyone could open them up, make sense of the whole goddamn store.
So... they didn't...
Fucker!
Oh, you are...
Let me in the house! Fucker!
What do you mean, what am I gonna do? I'm in the same clothes for two days! I want to get a few of my things! Big deal!
What happened to your eye?
Tell egghead I said hi. If you see him.
Listen... you want to get a drink? I got a new place. Or we could go to a bar ... Well, maybe not a bar. But I know a place uptown, if you want --
Oh. Carrots. And peas. None of the important ones.
What? Now. St. Peter's Church, and Peter too, he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
Madam, in happy time what day is that?
My doctor told me that I got to move out West... that's when we filed in court. We didn't want to sue...
I don't want to leave her. Dick... the, the... and Father Laughlin, he said that it was God's will...
...But Dick, he's looking for two years in Tucson... and they called him up and said to come out. He's a good man. He's only trying to do what's right.
Now Tom, you simply cannot go to Philadelphia tonight. That's all there is to it.
I don't care whether it's important or not. You said you were going out with me, and if you hadn't promised so faithfully, I wouldn't have gone and planned the whole thing.
Nothing. I broke a lamp.
I did my best but, well, you know me
Sure
Thing that bothers me now, though, looking back is that I really think I could have been something ... special.
I don't want you to--
When I met him I was just 20. And he was 55. I saw the gold ring and just grabbed on. And he was going to make me a star.
And he did.
Yeah. But all of a sudden it's not
Don't remind me.
See for yourself.
In my back yard. I lied before. It's hardly started. But when it's done, it will have twice the power of this one --
The truth. I just left you out of it.
What would you do up here?
I was twelve.
Yes, and then, what was there to call about? Everything was up in the air.
We discussed that. And decided not to.
Because the facts could be misconstrued as murder.
Well, he might be that man who followed me home from the store the other day. But I don't know who he is, Buddy, I really don't.
Happy anniversary. Thank you for making me a part of it.
What are they?
I think there are sixteen there.
It's ecstasy, Sal.
An interview! Do you know what they will do to us...! I thought... Sorry.
...taping? What are you taping?
No.
The fall alone would kill you.
How cold?
Can you tell me what happened?
There's nothing?
Was anyone hurt?
I had to see you.
You allus had good jobs, and that girl in Kentucky I taken a shine to her.
No.
What went wrong?
I didn't check my messages...
Didn't Principal Jaffee call you?
Help me what?
Oh my goodness... well, the whole thing is just ridiculous, and as soon as the school board is back in session next Fall I'm going to do everything I can to help you.
But... can I still get that scholarship to the Art Academy?
Well they're forcing me to give you a non-passing grade in the class because of what happened at the exhibition... but don't worry -- I'm sure I'll be able to get you your diploma in the Fall!
I'm sorry, Enid - you have to be an official high school graduate before I can nominate you. I had to give it to someone else... But I'm sure next year I can --
I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
The Catholic Church...
I hate ignorance and stupidity.
Nuns... you hate nuns.
What?
You hate us don't you?
Agnes...
How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
You can open it now, I guess. Lois Huggins says that's proper,
Oh, thank you, Amy.
Merry Christmas, Irena. I brought you a present.
Unh, unh.
Oh, that is more beautiful than I ever imagined it! I wish I could show you to mommy and daddy. I wish you could enjoy Christmas with us.
I shall wear it in my hair!
It reminded me of you, so I bought it. It cost me more than all the others.
Oh, how beautiful!
You don't remember anything else?
Oh, please!
You and I shall enjoy Christmas together. Shall I show you my Christmas gift to you?
No There is something...something there I can't tell... I can't describe it. There are things there.... but I'm... here.
How do you remember how to talk?
I don't know.
And?
His car's still there.
So I gathered.
David?
Yes. And he's going to get away with it.
You're such an incredible woman.
He only wants you to throw the stick for him, Jabez. I guess he's feeling the spring a-coming, too.
Jabez -- help!
Coming, Ma.
Why?
Is she coming back?
Drunk on brandy wine. A thimblefull. I thought of you when I saw them.
Yes. Why?
Well, I'm not borrowing any more money from my mother, and that's that!
Yes!
One royal pupil and the whole of Vienna will come flocking. We'd be set up for life!
No, they will not. I know how things work in this city.
Well, you're certainly not a person.
How are we going to live, Wolfi? Do you want me to go into the streets and beg?
Fine by me, sir!
Can I tell you a story, Rick?
I don't know the finish yet.
It's about a girl who had just come to Paris from her home in Oslo. At the house of some friends she met a man about whom she'd heard her whole life, a very great and courageous man. He opened up for her a whole beautiful world full of knowledge and thoughts and ideals. Everything she knew or ever became was because of him. And she looked up to him and worshipped him with a feeling she supposed was love.
Come with me.
Silencio! I just drank my weight in Sunny D. and I have to go, pronto.
Jesus, I didn't say it was.
About what?
Fine. Actually, today was a good day. You should have seen her.
I've decided it's impossible to properly say hello in this place without a hat.
Why don't we let Juno go home and we can discuss this later on, okay?
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows, as solemn as they are unsanctified.
Nothing, I was just wondering what you were doing.
How big is this spacecraft?
I guess it's not that obvious, then.
You should have left here years ago, like I did.
Thank you. I think so too. That's why I'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. I don't mean to be a pain in PG E's backside, especially after all they've done for Hinkley, but I look around here and I think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. And I don't just mean pay for the house; I'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.
It comforts you, doesn't it?
I adore things like that....food I can't do without. Don't you?
Why do you love peanut butter so much?
Okay...I think I'll go talk to my son now. How do I look?
Your Majesty
It's not the place. I don't buy that. Trapped in the same town forever. The price she would pay for her teenage lust.
What?
I know, I'm sorry.
Oh, honey, don't be totally naive.
I am? I mean why?
Anyway, you're crazy.
So what's your point?
Well, he is.
No, listen. He's a very good hairdresser.
I'm not. Maybe I am.
Ed, the landlord doesn't care.
Ed, the landlord called again. He wants his money.
I'm not tired. I thought I might finish Carolyn's skirt.
Later. Go back to sleep.
I won't wear your stuff. I promise.
Jacques, help me get her home. NOW!
Okay, I won't wear your stuff... Why can't I wear your stuff?
Don't ever wear my stuff, don't ever wear my stuff. Never.
You kidding? We must've killed three pots in there. Anyway, I gotta get home. Rest the pipes.
If there was, I didn't see it...
What?
Goodnight.
I won't tell you more about that. I'm more afraid of displeasing Him than not answering you...
To the other side of the street.
If you need me, I'll be --
No...
You kidding? Three days work. I finish tonight.
Yeah,well, a11 I know is mother nature must be one crazy dame. Shit.
Uh-uh. I never touch American cigarettes. What's tomorrow again?
Nice place. Fulla velvet. Even the bedspreads. Damn! Two-fifty a pack and I go through 'em like toothpicks. Twelve-and-a-half cents a piece, you believe that?
Paris Opals. Twelve-and-a-half cents. I sat down with a pencil and added it one day. But I figure, if you're gonna be sticking something in your mouth, you might as well make it the best. Ah, here's a lost soul.
No!
I'm fine - it's just morning sickness.
We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
No, no, no, no. The soil on the shovel, his shovel...that's clay. It's not from here, believe me, I... All right, look at this.
Get down! He'll see.
Shhhh.
He killed her.
He did. She's in the picture. I went over to look and she's gone. The table was set for one.
You men are shameful. If you're not thinking of your weiner then you're acting on its behalf.
When?
What if I said I wouldn't sleep with you again until you let me meet your friends?
I think I can make it to South Boston.
Is it me you're hiding from them or the other way around?
Craig, I just don't find you attractive. And, Lotte, I'm smitten with you, but only when you're in Malkovich. When I looked into his eyes last night, I could feel you peering out. Behind the stubble and the too-prominent brow and the male pattern baldness, I sensed your feminine longing peering out, and it just slew me.
Yum, yum.
It sounded like he and Caesar don't like each other.
Like each other? They hate each other.
Why?
It started way before I was around. I think basically it's because he thinks Johnnie is a complete idiot. But Johnnie runs Chicago because Gino is his father.
Yes.
Good.
All right, now, tell me about Johnnie.
Johnnie?
Who is Gino?
Gino Marzzone.
No, I'm callin' from the Playboy Mansion.
I'll call you right back.
You mean you haven't asked him yet? For Christ sake, Thelma, is he your husband or your father? It's just two days. For God's sake, Thelma. Don't be a child. Just tell him you're goin' with me, for cryin' out loud. Tell him I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.
There's two of 'em, Lou!
Yes, I do.
He already thinks you're out of your mind, Louise, that don't carry much weight with Darryl. Are you at work?
No.
28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
Oh, it wasn't my secret, Richard. Victor wanted it that way. Not even our closest friends knew about our marriage. That was his way of protecting me. I knew so much about his work, and if the Gestapo found out I was his wife it would be dangerous for me and for those working with me.
Cheese is particularly troublesome.
Calvin, I wish you would have at least let me do the dishes. It's not going to be that easy getting all that dried- on food off my nice plates.
Yes.
What?
Mm-hm.
Just a Diet Coke.
Oh, much worse. But not as bad as that Mexican Jumping Bean dip. You remember that?
It looks wonderful.
I just thought it would be nice.
That would be murder, Mr. Deckard.
I've got a good lock on my door. And Bobby's going to sleep in my room tonight.
Yes, dear. Come on now. Bobby, your shoes are soaking!
Oh -- hello--
Green Eggs and Ham. You're not going to get anywhere. You might as well put me in the cage.
I -- I was Just going to lunch.
I'll try to drop by later.
I want to apologize about my brother and the Mau-Mau's. I should not have imposed them on you.
The pleasure is mine.
You're not gonna start that again.
Wasn't deemed a threat.
Jon -- I don't have time to play games. There're leftovers in the fridge.
Goodnight.
Uh huh. Yeah. Forget it.
Maybe it'll be at the end of the data when the message recycles.
Oh, darn it.
Yeah, but it's real close.
Uh, yeah, uh... t-t-this is more like a present for you, yeah, but it's-
What is this? Is this a... Present? Are you kidding?
I've never been to Louisville.
No, I'm fine.
You know, I just want to look so good, but I don't want to seem, you know, like I'm overdressed. You know what I'm saying? HANNAH Oh, no, not at all.
Oh, God, that's too much responsibility for me. It's not fair! I want a less complicated life, Frederick. I want a husband, maybe even a child before it's too late.
You didn't give them a name.
Because you cut it from the budget three years running.
Our room. I don't want to see him and he's not going to come knocking on your door.
Kill him.
Hush, sweetheart.
You're Frankie Lazzaro. The gangster from Rhode Island.
Matthew, look at him. When I lived in Roxbury, the media followed this man everywhere. He was bigger than ten movie stars. Where's your white Lincoln limo?
The most charming gangster in New England. Where are we going, Mr. Lazzaro?
I don't think so. You need help with the pants?
It's me... Johana.
Yeah. Some of them...yeah, some of them are very big.
Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
Are you supposed to?
Sure. What's that funny smell?
Oh.
If you say so.
Well. I like a man who gets to the point.
Yeah it's French. There's no accent aigue, so the e is soft.
It isn't right. I can't...I...I know I si...I, they, I don't know if they told me it was in the con...
Dad's like doing his Up With People routine, mom hasn't been saying much.
You heard? How?
Great. Another deadbeat.
Your fingerprints were all over the bedroom.
Did you confess?
I told you -- with my mother.
Some setup you got here. A real, honest-to-goodness love nest.
A hundred and seventy-ninth street -- the Bronx.
Hey, hey, hey. I think somebody's got some new clothes.
You're discussing me with your psychic?
Yeah. I'm probably ruining them.
Don't be a jerk. There's no such thing as love at first sight.
I'm never here. I gotta leave 'em with this weird sitter all afternoon who costs a fortune and smells like chicken fat.
... Since eight o'clock last night...! You're in love.
Thought you swore you'd never Carry that thing again.
But why me?
Do you intend to marry, my lord?
You think I care? You think I care if I die? Would I put explosives around the habitat -- set on vibration sensors -- that can trigger automatically, if I cared about myself? Would I? I've tried twice before, Norman, why wouldn't I try a third time? I'm not thinking about myself -- No, Norman, I'm thinking about you. Your safety. Protecting you from your own self.
For your information, Mr Lombard, trouble is possibly the one thing Leon is capable of getting into all by himself. Though I doubt he will not ultimately fail even at that.
Well, it ain't your baby.
She's a witch, that one. I tell you what happen yesterday?
You told me.
She gave me the evil eye.
What happen?
I keep one eye open when I sleep, because she's gonna come in, stab me in my bed.
Ufa!
Ah?
Catherine, I want you come live in my house with Marty and me.
Oh, yah, I know that!
I'll have it tonight. Nine o'clock? Ten?
Joe, could we talk it over? Do you want a drink?
Joe, you know you'll --
We'll work something out, Joe.
Just a guess. She ain't dead though is she?
She left you right?
Just a guess. Did you have it good with your wife? You know, sex.
Yes.
I bet you have loyal customers.
Tell me what it was.
Been eatin' like a princess all week. Even got enough for us to take a picnic under the gazebo.
Anthony, Daddy's busy.
I'm sorry, Michael. Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left. Won't you join us, Mr. Ola?
No, just a farewell appearance, batting for Sweeney. I'm going into business for myself.
Can't you say 'hello' to a fellow?
Oh yes, I play with them... lots...
Thank you.
Boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.
Were you really a prize fighter?
I don't think you know what you're talking about.
Sounds risky to me.
What point is that?
You lost me.
Can't you just quit? Walk away?
Frank -- It's Rebecca. I need to see you right away. I've got the tape.
That's crazy.
You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced?
Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie?
And now we're glad you did.
Hello.
M-E...
Dmitri?
Very creative. Now we can get you a black bow tie and you can look like one of those casino dealers.
Two hundred pounds.
I...
What? I have a five-o'clock plane to catch.
Machines do not EAT message.
Might be...
Oh.
Daddy, how come that coffin's so small?
I'm sorry. I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. It must've been the bars.
Now who's being sarcastic?
Three seasons. They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. I was wife number three -- the ingenue.
If it played in England somebody owes me money. Who told you that -- Eddie?
He was all right to me.
Nicer than most.
Rehab. Outpatient. I have to go once a week. It's kind of like AA.
Sure, all the time, in Group.
Uh, ninety days. And now I just have to go once a week. See, I'm rehabilitated.
Intense.
No. Oh, maybe. Fuck.
James...
Okay.
Yes, I love you. I've told you, but it doesn't really matter.
No, it doesn't... just kiss me.
Right now?
Hold on.
Oh. I can't.
No one would come out here unless they had business. And no one would have business with me except for you. You're buying the town.
So I've heard.
What are you doing?
You must be Edward Bloom.
The what?
Two miles.
Like what you're doing. I'm not going to eat you up. I need your help, and if you keep staring at me like that. I might start screaming.
I'm a doctor.
Well maybe.
It's very becoming to you, Mr. Selectman.
I'll never get my washing done.
Don't go telling anyone. It'll ruin my reputation.
You already packed up your stuff?
I need it.
What?
Where's my paycheck?
Oh, it is?
Now how'm I supposed to do that when I'm not in here most mornings and nights?
No, I don't think so. Leave me alone, give me money. That's what I get from our daughter. She has a way of shutting me out that seems very familiar.
The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
I started to get serious about seven years ago.
Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
You do that?
What do you do when he comes home?
Did you do it that night?
Stacy. How many times do I have to tell you? You are really going to be beautiful... someday.
Actually, it was two. You're different, Officer White. You're the first man in five years who didn't tell me I look like Veronica Lake inside of a minute.
But you did it anyway.
Nothing makes any sense. Nothing makes any sense.
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
About ten dollars.
Cheap date.
The plot thickens. It appears that Cecile has fallen for her music teacher.
No.
I rat Cecile out to mommy. Mommy goes ballistic and ends their relationship. Boo hoo.
Not to mention Court Reynolds. Unfortunately, Ronald's moving with the speed of a Special Olympic Bobsledder.
What kind of man are you? Are you a good man?
The Master is waiting for you.
I'm keeping away. What you are doing is no business of mine.
You feel I've done a dreadful thing--leaving him?
And you, Colonel? Let me guess: You don't know.
Right and we have the '81 pilot on the way in -- Nobody else will have him.
Sid! Oh, it's beautiful! You mean...
I can't go like this. Can't you wait a few minutes 'til I'm ready?
You what?
Let's go tell Paula! God, I wonder where we'll be stationed first. I hope it'll be Hawaii. I've always wanted to go to Hawaii.
But... but what would we do? Where would we go?
I'm telling you, Smitty, the board of Hudsucker is up to something --
So. Anything else?
There were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City in the last six days. Four a day. What do you think about that, Mr. Creasy?
We do not go into your courts.
Oh no. I'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to Manhattan Beach, taking that left down to little tiny Waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but -- hey, I've obviously had too much coffee and all -- here's my sister Laurel to pick us up. Thanks, though. Bye.
Why, I think it's very sweet of the children--
Shut the door, Lester. What do you think this is, a picnic?
You take cream or sugar?
supporting that gang of loafers! There's not one of them that cares a damn for you. A wife who threw you out the first time your foot slipped. They wouldn't raise a hand to help you. And I've given my whole life for you. If you kicked off tomorrow, where'd I be? Out in the gutter! Sure I took those bonds. Who has a better right -- ?
I'm going to my parents this weekend. What am I going to wear? How could you do that to me?
Basquiat, those are my best clothes!!! What are you doing?
Oh, I'm just not lucky Harry.
Go???
I just had a terrible thought Harry.
Aarrggh.
I'm gonna be putting makeup on some of these people very soon.
Well, that changes everything. Get the fuck away from me!! I mean it!!
Get away from me!!
I'm not taking you there, Sweetie. Rule Number One in North America: No strangers in the car.
You don't?
Rogers Hornsby?!?
Like what?
What for?
We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what!
Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you!
You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need!
It doesn't matter. Really. I think I can muddle through. Okay - The Story of Candaules and Gyges. King Candaules was passionately in love with his wife - One day he said to Gyges, the son of somebody, anyway - his favorite warrior -
What's April 16th?
I can't sing. but I can tell a story. I might need a prompt. Do you have your Herodotus? I've noticed you carry it
I want that money right now, or I'll hand you over to the police.
You're also a fool.
Not before we get something straight you prissy little bitch. I decide when I'm done with your boyfriend. Not him, and certainly not you. Unless maybe you want to find out just how sharp these nails really are.
Let go of my hand.
Help... Lemme go... No, don't let me go... Help...
That's okay, hon. I gotta run.
Aw, you can sleep, hon.
Thanks, hon. Time to shove off.
Aw, Norm.
There, there... shhh...
I've never seen anyone killed before.
Pick you up at eight tomorrow morning.
Right now.
Then I started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.
I want to see you.
It was warmer than I thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. It's weird. Thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. I mean, after he pulled it out and I could look at it and touch it, I completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. I remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.
He said that my hand felt good.
Hi.
Yeah, you met her?
To that stewardess?
Yeah. Can't wait to see him I just saw Quincy.
I can manage.
Engaged.
How is he?
So what do I do?
What's wrong?
Your sister said you don't have a family?
Bye.
Montgomery Clift, wait 'till I tell Shelly.
Jack. Jack Bangs.
I love you more.
Probably marry some rich doctor and never have to work...
Don't pull it, Norman. It'll start a fire we can't stop. Norman?
Andy... this is Nick Charles. He worked on a case for father.
was fascinated with you.... a real live detective.... You used to tell me the most wonderful stories. Were they true?
I dressed the wound. Then I've just been feeding everyone, putting everyone to bed.
No thanks. I'm going to turn in.
'kay.
You're not someone I could get interested in. Craig. You play with dolls.
Yikes.
So what if he was? It's all your years of waitin' tables has made you jaded, that's all.
Jeez, Louise, that wasn't very nice.
So, Jimmy still hasn't called yet?
Givin' him a taste of his own medicine. Asshole.
Maybe.
Well, just relax, will ya. You're makin' me nervous.
I'm sorry, Louise. I know you're all upset. It's just I'm so excited to be out of the house, I guess. I wonder if Darryl's home yet.
It was a long time ago.
Of course.
Me? Are you kidding? Why?
What do you want to know, Evan?
Well, sure. I'll try to remember. Shoot.
Jake!
What's wrong?
I am... I did slave all day.
Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
We have it on video! Was that when? My parents were down for his sixth birthday! I remember that.
I'm fine. Nothing. I'll drop by your lunch tomorrow.
But I don't want to be like that. I want to do something...
I did it for her.
You know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. I mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. And all my friends, I know they're going to smile and say they loved it.
Forget it.
Dick... and my mother! She acts like she's on Mars or something --
I don't have what they want, Harry. Harry, will you tell me something? How can I keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?
No, they don't, do they?
Why?
We went about together.
Yes, while he was here.
Mine. His. We both...thought...
I didn't want to come.
I don't know. Depends what train I get on.
I don't think that's accurate...
I think it's what you think.
Instead of a girdle. And light as a feather.
Oh, yeah...
Staring. Consequently, when he approached me on his way out I wasn't surprised, but I didn't let on.
Well, sure.
John, play the Sinatra.
I'm the only left, Dick. If you don't talk to me, you ...
I wish I knew. You're hiding.
Whatever it is you've always been hiding. You're letting it destroy you, Dick. You won't even ask for help. You're destroying yourself, Dick.
No, it isn't. I won't interfere with you anymore. I'm finished trying.
That too tight?
Buzzie--we better get out of here.
What crisis?
Do it...
It won't hold.
I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you.
Not yet, dear brother...
You want control of the crowd -- you can't get it by killing their hero.
You can't do that... listen to the mood of the crowd.
Are you serious?
Is that the truth?
Yes.
Candy.
I'm stuck. Does it get easier.
Yes, Pimenov. One minute, Suzette, I will call you.
Good morning, Pimenov.
Uh, hold on...
She is horrible.
He is not going to kill the old man?
What difference does it make? If anything was to happen, which I'm sure it isn't, it would be my responsibility.
I'm a little late, that's all.
What scene?
Suppose you make up your mind. Do you want this job or don't you?
What's that?
You proud boy, why didn't you tell me you were having difficulties.
What do you care? Suppose I was pregnant. Just suppose it. You don't think I'd try to make you do anything you don't want to, do you?
He tried to kill us. If not just now, then in the helicopter. That's all the authority I need.
Yes.
I hope it will, yes. I'm sorry.
Don't take anything.
The baby I lost...
You haven't heard me.
At this moment, I feel no love for you at all. I never thought that could happen, but it has.
Oh, I do feel things for you, Michael; but now, I think it's pity. For the first time since I've known you, you seem so helpless. You held me a prisoner once; will you try again?
It wasn't a miscarriage. And you with your cunning, couldn't you figure it out! It was an abortion; an abortion, like our marriage is an abortion, something unholy and evil. I don't want your son; I wouldn't bring another of your sons into this world. An abortion, Michael... it was a son, and I had it killed, but this must all end!
I was so scared...I didn't know what would happen with you...once I started. I almost let you go on so many times. It will be worth it, together. When I was alone, I knew.
They're talking to themselves.
What?
No, no. I don't want to be idle.
No.
Settle it yourself. What have I got a lawyer for?
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
What?
No, he wouldn't.
Don't do this to me. You're too good at making me nervous.
Besides, Dad would have freaked.
Tell me again.
Okay.
What a nice place.
My stomach's growling.
Eve, this is an old friend of Mr. deWitt's mother - Miss Caswell, Miss Harrington... Addison, I've been wanting you to meet Eve for the longest time-
You've heard of her great interest in the Theater-
Then you two must have a long talk-
I can't.
What?
Go ahead.
It's not that easy.
Who the fuck are you, Dr. Joyce Brothers? I hate the son-of-a-bitch.
And you went home unannounced, too?
You didn't even find that out?
Daniel! ... You must go to sleep.
All right, darling.
John doesn't have sex with Ann anymore.
He doesn't have to tell me.
But can't you see... I love you, Antoine.
I hate my sister.
That was beautiful to watch, Howard. Like a surgeon or a concert pianist.
I don't know. Just...whispering.
He couldn't look at me. But I looked at him. Right at him. His secret was mine now. We used to share it. But not anymore. Now, I owned it completely.
Well, how do you expect me to react to such a thing?
I was looking for you.
Oh, don't say those words!
I . . ..
Great.
Wait...! Um, where ya going?
I...yes.
Well I'm so glad that you guys are.
Well, you wanna use the shower?
You know, that is my worst fear. Making a sound and no one hears it.
Oh.
Wait?
Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
I...
Cuz let me tell you, you boys gotta run the ball more. You get into a kicking game, ya'll gonna lose.
You go to hell.
Hi.
You ain't the kicker, are you?
Nothing.
Keep going. Go around to the back.
Don't stop!
But I don't know, Sol. I never heard of Sol. I'd just get in trouble. That's why we shouldn't go see about Diane Selwyn... it's better not to get in trouble.
You're not going to get in trouble. You're going to find out who you are. Finding out who you are gets you out of trouble.
Do you know them?!
What is it? What do you see?!
Those men in front, in the car.
Yes. Should I take her, Louis? Among her dolls? make a doll of her in turn?
Nothing.
Patrick?
Yes. Samuel! We're going.
He's from... Ohio... My cousin.
John, lost control of himself. He... will be repentant.
Sure.
That's true.
God, I'll have to go on a plane.
I want to go home.
Oh.
I'm the photographer.
What do you think?
Is it against the law?
Why not?
Doctor King is my favorite.
Let me hear it!
Likewise I'm sure.
Ronald is one of the few high school students attending Juliard. He's composing his first opera.
Oh, I suck. I suck.
How old are you?
... You worried everything all right now and we'll have to go home?
Honey, nobody's trying to cure you --
Well... So you tried riding again?
About what?
Whatever happens.
No, it was so right it scares me.
I've got to go --
You'll have a hard time finding a woman like that these days --
Why?
They must work on the section gang.
What about...what about...it's so presumptuous of me, to be, to be telling you how to wr...
That's what he says. He could be a spy, or something.
We can't just leave him. He'll run back to his outfit, report our position...
He'd just slow us down, and drink our water. And if we ran into any more Iraqis you know he'd sell us out.
You don't know he isn't.
He's an enemy soldier.
You accepted an invitation, Maddy's one of your best friends, and I baked the Rice Krispie squares.
For what?
Where are you going?
I'm not.
The TV didn't work.
I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
He's the worst liar.
Maybe they got crimes in California we don't know about. Crimes we don't even know is crimes.
Your pa tol' me you didn't ought to cross it if you're paroled. Says they'll send you up again.
-- I'll get in the back --
What a fucking day! We only just got a sitter. I don't know her from fucking Adam. She could be a serial killer. I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number.
Supposed you dropped dead. What about your inventory?
Please...
Margo, nothing you've ever done has made me as happy as your taking Eve in...
... Among so many quiet qualities.
I'm so happy you're happy.
Make it Bergdorf Goodman... and now everything is on its proper shelf, eh, Max? Done up in little ribbons. I could die right now and nobody'd be confused. How about you, Max?
It's not here, Caesar.
I don't know. it could be anywhere. We don't even know if he was alone. Please, Caesar, we don't have much time. Let's get out of here.
What are you doing?
"It's not me, Beth. It's not me. It can't be. I'm not doing anything." Just like Harry said before I stabbed him with the needle.
But I have to, Norman.
Promise what, Norman? Tell me!
You think I'd belive you? Believe anything you might say now? After you lied to me about telling Barnes about my past. About my problems. My problems. Not yours. Not his. Mine.
It's either this... or I kill you.
Mr. Gittes.
Steve?
Lloyd.
Reverend Edwards.
No. Why? I like to be with Sam.
Home after. Will you come in and say "hi"?
Nothing R, okay?
Where did you stop last?
Where did you stop last?
What was your last stop?
I don't believe it.
Do you really think anything can ever be like it was before?
I was so excited about meeting you. Again and again, I kept getting in the back of the line so I could be the last to talk to you.
I miss Tommi so much.
It's ok, take your time.
It's just for verification through the credit card company.
And your Social Security number.
He wants to be me... or he will kill me.
What things? Why?
Is that all there is to it?
Gosh, what was everybody talking about?
No.
What?
Bobby... ssshhhh... you killed Mike.
I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
What should they be looking for?
It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
Where? It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
No, why did you come here?
Guess I don't have to worry about him anymore.
You need my help?
No, thanks--I'm doing this on my own.
Josie! Josie, how'd it go? Did he ream you?
Yeah, but I'm okay. I've got some work to do.
What difference will it make?
Don't you think anything that can suffer deserves to be considered?
Do you think I simulated what happened between us?
You know what I think?
Failure of the bone marrow to produce red blood cells... Not a damn thing they can do about it. Oh, they can make me comfortable, prolong my life with steroid therapy and transfusions... And what makes my blood boil, what little I have left, that is, Mr. Gardiner - is that it's generally a young person's disease... Here I am, getting on in years and about to die of a young person's disease...
Yes. Now go along, Mister McMurphy. Go along.
Wait till you see her, Auggie.
That I wasn't bullshitting you, sweetheart. At least you'll know I've been telling the truth.
I told her she was going to meet her father.
It was the only way, Auggie. Otherwise, she wasn't going to let me see her.
That happens. To families.
I'll be there for you.
Oh my God. Are you serious?
Hey, future boy. Frank tells me you're a cop?
Okay...Is that the good thing or the bad thing?
The future guy?
Why no silencer?
'Spose to kill this fool named Buddy Israel.
You do the right thing. Sit with me while I heal, let it develop slow.
Ya Vhol. What are you, a fucking Nazi?
He brought you to me, didn't he? If you want Julia to live, trust me. Trust him.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
"I came back. I thought that's what you wanted."
"You're still here?"
Yes I know. I started to say... I started to say Joe that --
Don't be silly.
I don't know why Joe, we've known each other how long...
Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good. But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, "what's this?" You know? I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all. Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going. Don't you find?
Roy? It this all we have?
Maybe I'll swing around Los Ang gleez on the way.
I know.
Look at me.
Roy?
That's because you keep reminding me. If you go away then I'll forget.
Nobody will swim here until next summer. By then, the water will have rubbed the glass smooth against the sand--there won't be any sharp edges.
I'm not sick.
Agnes, I'm here because I want to help you.
Answer me! You never answer me.
Agnes...
Everyone's unhappy, you're unhappy aren't you?
Only you think you're lucky because you didn't have a mother who said things to you and did things to you that maybe weren't always nice but that was because of me, because I was bad, not her.
Sometimes, yes.
I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
It's freezing out here.
Cool.
At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
What mountain?
Thank you, Belle --
What a nice -- and kind girl -- Who is she --?
Jabez -- ?
Jimmy's calling every day. It's urgent.
I didn't say I thought we should have saved him..
I said I wished it had at least occurred to me to consider saving him.
What're we talking about? Reach out for what?
Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
She is kicking you out.
But you said...you said out there, there ain't no...what was that word?..no..de- fense. No de-fense.
Because you refuse to believe she's serious. You've always refused.
Oh please. Not now. She wants you to stop seeing What's- Her-Name. Finally. Now and forever. Do you think that's too much to ask? For a wife of nineteen years.
What?
John has fallen in love with me!
What??
How do you know? Did he tell you?
That idiot boarder?
Good to see you're feeling better.
Sure it is. You're a virgin. Just like that nun. And I'm gonna rape you.
Who?
C'mere. You got some good blow, right?
First I'll put your Uptown in the spoon, then, to make it more exciting, I'm gonna add some Downtown. They call this thing a speedball, honey, but then you must know that... First time shooting up?
Then c'mere. I got something for you.
He's dead.
Yes, Uncle. How are you?
And you're our thirty-percent partner?
Good samba dancing...?
'Cause you don't lose loads?
He ask, I give him anything.
What?
Well, sure, Roy. You want me to drive up --? Okay, fine, come on down. It won't be a home-cooked meal, you know.
No, he's the dad.
Can I trade in my car and take another?
But he acted like he'd never heard of it.
I think it kind of looks like my friend, Paulie.
Behold, good sir! The very first photo of your future child.
Yes, it's... nothing wrong with it, I'm just...
He's not a racehorse, Bud, he's a jumper.
My grandchild-baby.
He was executed. He was on Death Row and then he was executed.
People can see.
Alright... I just wanna slow down Bud... no more calls for awhile, no lunches... we suspend our business, alright...
I'm so sorry... I was sorry to hear.
I am. I'm wakin' her up right now.
I am not! She's my daughter too! Goddamn you!
You shouldn't let him do that to you...
Sorry. Boy I'll tell ya, if Early found a picture of me like that I'd be black and blue for a week.
Adele... are you serious?
Do what?
Yeah.
You think Early's bad to me, don't you?
But, please, Steve, please - one step at a time! I was born only yesterday!...
Cal, surely you remember Mr. Dawson.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. And you know something? I think that I'm starting to get more of your references, too.
Alvy, you were... Alvy, you were just great, I'm not kidding. It was- You were so neat.
I've never seen anything like it.
Michael, what are those men doing?
Actually, he's a really nice guy.
Hi.
You're lucky then, you can't see the veins on that guy's biceps.
Oh, hi... I almost didn't recognize you -- I think I need to get glasses; you're all blurry!
Do you?
What a memory.
Yeah.
Let's do it.
I know.
Oh my god.
Are you crazy?! You can't do this.
Hear one. Rob, this is so like you. You know, you can't just come in here and be popular in just one day.
You're twenty-three years old!
That's right, take his part. You're his brother. He's never gonna be champ. Too many people are against him.
You don't sleep with him. I do. I don't get to breathe without tellin' him. He keeps me in a cage. If he thinks I'm lookin' at somebody the wrong way, I get used as a punching bag. He don't trust nobody. If he saw the two of us talking together right now, you'd be in trouble too -- believe me. Look at me, Joey. I'm 19 years old. I wanna enjoy my life. I love Jake, but you don't know. He gets crazy sometimes. I'm scared.
And I'm gonna finish my drink. And, I'm gonna have a good time, because I ain't doing nothing wrong.
Harry, you know everything.
No, but I might have some Indian Chief Tonic.
Oh, Patrick, you didn't want any, did you?
Well, allow me to do the honors. It's fucking freezing and I need something.
Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil. Found it my Bartletts.
I've been all over town. I got a call from the bondman. He says they're going to rescind your bail if you don't show up and sign in right now. They're going to take away the house.
I thought you were supposed to turn yourself in at ten o'clock this morning?
I was not a failure.
Air-raid?
Mac, that was wonderful. I haven't been to a concert since...
That's right. Not since then Not since I got married.
Oh, my God.
It's a good day. I feel good.
How do you know that?
A number for the whole group, or for us?
Both.
Well, then -- if you're feeling up to it, maybe we should talk shop.
The judge came up with a number.
If I knew you were coming I'd have baked a cake.
I want to feel something else than this. It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
It'll have to be sex, then.
Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
No, no... I'm just so tired, and lost, and... I didn't realize what I was doing!
I am true -- to my Lord, the King of Heaven. He knows how much I love him -- that's all that matters to me...
I don't know -- I don't care anymore -- I just want to be at peace!
What's wrong?
Well he's handsome and he's Charming. He's all right. For Now. Don't say it, I know, I'm Rotten. I can't help it. I've Tried to be good but it's too Boring.
How do you say "you're dreaming" in Italian?
It ain't even three years we been married.
Of course not. We're going to Baltimore. It's much nicer in Baltimore.
You give such charming parties, Mr. Charles.
And when I'm 38, you'll be 48. And that's not much difference at all.
You live here.
I want to touch it.
There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
I can sea its breath in the cold.
It's a warm breath -- warm and strong warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
Lieutenant O'Neil.
Not due in for 22 minutes, sir. Watcha got?
Thanks for taking care of this for me.
And when things get in your way or people you just knock them aside get rid of Them is that your idea?
No.
Yes. I don't remember where Agnes was. I was needed in the sick room.
The twenty third of January. On that night one of our elder nuns passed away.
I don't know... I don't know...
You want me to tell you it's okay to leave? Okay, go on! GO!
Why do you call it an investigation? I never have.
Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right?
But you wanted to talk. Tell me.
Tell me.
I waited up till midnight.
That meeting only lasted ten minutes. The first night I'm home, and you run to the beer parlor. What is it? Can't you bear the sight of me?
I don't know ... Maybe because you've never needed my help.
Goodbye, mother.
Allie, I know exactly why you're doing this.
Are they paying you for all this?
Alexander... I know you.
He's best friends with Jim Gordon and Harvey Dent. They would know.
I've had it with you. I'm leaving.
Oh, well, I cannot communicate with you! I, you know, I never realized you were such a tightass. MICKEY I can't understand you. Your sisters, both sisters have such good taste in music. I don't know where you went, went wrong.
Why? Because she won't sleep with you?
Thanks for getting rid of those flowers.
It's just some guy I met at Swenson's. You don't know him.
Is everything okay at work?
You're going to break up with Lisa, aren't you?
I think it is.
I said I think it is.
Well, I want you to leave.
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything? How could you possibly rape my...
I don't understand --
That's what it is, isn't it? Keep me down. Your turn to be in charge, have the power.
And that's why you've got to get rid of this money. If you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. It'll be a temptation to get back into the game.
Okay.
Well, I've come this far...the least I can do is knock on the door.
A secret, I like that.
Okay.
I should do this myself.
Hi again, how's it going?
If you're going to insult me --
Refill my drink, will you, Bob?
Putting on my armor.
Not to mention people driving over her and doggies doing their business --
I remember a Mrs. Delaney but Mama told me years ago she died.
Mr. Peterson, are you sure mama wrote all this?
Maybe it's an Italian thing. Their mother was Italian.
Because I don't believe that Clyde's dead! Why, you said yourself you saw him last night.
Coach...
That's what you get for trying to show out, freshman.
Tomorrow, I start looking for our house... You love me?
My ass if falling.
My ass is falling. It is.
I just saw it in the mirror, it doesn't look like my ass anymore.
What am I gonna do? I jog, I do the exercises on TV in the morning... gravity...
Huh?
I know there's a plan for everyone, but sometimes I don't understand what the message is -- or what the point is.
What?
Let's face it, Ben, we're having fun here. I've never done so much talking in my life.
It's not about sex, Ben. I'll make you up a bed on the sofa. Do it for me. We can talk till late and then sleep till late. As you know, I am my own boss.
Three nights, two days. When is your rent coming up at the motel?
There's no reason to blow all your money on a hotel room.
What I mean is that you should bring your stuff over here. We're spending all this time together... what the fuck!
That's good. So then what do you do now?
Rocky, do you realize everybody in this country knows your face, and after the fight everybody in the world is going to.
'Sucking off.'
No. But does it make any difference? How did you get to be the way you are?
What now ?
We made it !
No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
That shirt?
Really?
You need to call your dad.
She's in ICU.
Harry called.
Lucy overdosed.
That guy rules!
It's just an excuse for us to spend time with you.
Please Josh?
So Josh, if this guy freaks out, will you protect us?
I didn t intend it that way... It just happened. He heard from Laurence that you d been back. That we d argued. He asked why and it just happened; I told him everything... I couldn t help it. Wanted to see him scared. I had never seen him scared before, you see...
My husband didn t need to slap me about, Mr Lombard. I volunteered...
Have you been talking to Holly or Lee about us? About our-our personal life?
We should be going --
Yeah, no, I have to get something from my car, I said.
Should I?
I'm sorry I couldn't come to your sister's birthday party last night, Elizabeth had invited me and I couldn't make it --
I think I would. And teach me to spit too. Like a man. Why should only men be able to spit. It's unfair.
Why can't I be like you Jack? Just head out for the horizon whenever I feel like it. Say we'll go there, sometime... to that pier... even if we only ever just talk about it.
You mean one leg on each side? Scandalous! Can you show me?
Not this weekend, sweetie, she's runnin' away with me. Hi. What'd he say?
What time are you gonna pick me up?
You're kiddin'! Alright! I'll be there around two or three.
What kind of stuff do I bring?
I don't know. Warm stuff, I guess. It's the mountains. I guess it gets cold at night. I'm just gonna bring everything.
Okay. I will, too.
I don't know how to fish, Louise.
Neither do I, Thelma, but Darryl does it, how hard can it be? I'll see you later. Be ready.
Not everything your father says is a complete fabrication.
I'm going to check on him.
Get away from me... get away! She means that much to you, you stay with her. But you come back, you come back for me. Not for Tommy, not for your mother, or your fucking job, but for me.
Frank, don't talk that way. Who's that strange lookin' man behind you? Did he follow you in here?
Nice to meet you, Karl.
That was fun.
I want to know you.
Don't you think Howard's like that? Smart? Important?
You don't tell me things, Joel. I'm an open book. I tell you everything. Every damn embarrassing thing. You don't trust me.
I think he'll be in Bartlett's one day.
Should I wake her?
No.
Yes.
I wish I didn't love you so much.
I can't fight it anymore. I ran away from you once. I can't do it again. Oh, I don't know what's right any longer. You'll have to think for both of us, for all of us.
Check out Baby Big-Head. That kid is scary!
Hey, I'm a sacred vessel. All you've got in your belly is Taco Bell!
Touche.
It is really weird looking. It's like it's not even real. I can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.
What? I'm not made of stone.
I thought it was Mrs. Feur, but it's not...
I'm sure, I don't know.
No one in Rome has ever heard of him. Do you want to remind those few in the Senate who have? The whole sordid thing is far beneath your position to begin with. Forget about him.
I don't know. It would be small, easy to transport and hide. Gold or jewels. Probably gold.
If! If there's a treasure.
The Fountainhead.
Best friends.
Of course I would. We're friends, right?
You'd do that for me?
Not like that. Not like you say.
Oh. What?
You must be Hugo.
Would you like to see the rest?
What do you do?
Really? Well, come on, then.
You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.
Sure, and I guess it was just convenient there was one less person to split the gold with.
No. The lawyer -- I'm going to see him.
No, no.
Shhhh.
No, Benjamin.
He said he thought we'd make a pretty good team.
The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure.
Where do you want to do this?
Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next.
Am I not safe enough with you, John?
You better come sit down. You are still sick.
I just thought I'd drop by, scrounge a little lunch, I was in the neigh- borhood --
No.
Nothing is what I said! Go on, kill me. Kill me. I'm not afraid of you anymore. I don't care if you kill me like you're killing him. You're a sick animal.
...Well, it didn't make him happy...
Of course.
He must be tired -- this Bontecou thing --
You were wonderful!
Don't be silly! And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said " au revoir."
So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men.
Ready!
I'm worried.
He likes her better than me.
Then go home, baby.
Leave then, some friend you are.
No, I'm hiding out.
Mom, don t you think we need to open the presents?
Mommy needs five more minutes in la la land. That could be her present...
Rise...and...shine...!
You re jumping, sweetheart...
You don't understand, we have nothing to do with your laws!
Well then, maybe you should just read the ending.
When my Shi'ite friends saw that they had shot an American they were very apologetic. Turns out we've been kicking ass in this little war. They figure we've finally gotten Saddam off their backs. They brought me to their camp, cleaned me up, fed me... I'm their new best buddy. America number one, Joe. But there's something the Shi'ites can't figure out: They can't figure out why my two buddies, two fellow Americans, left me out in the desert. They can't seem to figure out what those same two guys were doing in an Iraqi outpost. It's almost as if they were Iraqi spies, or something. And I've got to tell you they hate anything that's got to do with the Iraqis. See how I mean?
Eve... why don't you start at the beginning?
It couldn't possibly interest you.
Did you see it here in New York?
San Francisco. It was the last week. I went one night... the most important night in my life - until this one. Anyway... I found myself going the next night - and the next and the next. Every performance. Then, when the show went East - I went East.
If I only knew how...
Try...
Well...
Well... it started with the play before this one...
His name's Harry Sultenfuss.
Thanks.
No, but sometimes he drives a hearse.
Well, hell, I guess that's it, then, huh? They're scarred for life. They're gonna start holding up 7-11's any day now.
George, I am just trying to do something nice for my kids on my one day off. Could you please not give me a hard time about it?
This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
No. I have children, grandchildren too. I visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.
He is dead now, twenty years.
What are you talking about?
No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The deed no man can name without shame?
Hi, Daddy, what do you think?
It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not?
Don't make conversation with me.
Yes.
I'm saying it's not going to happen. Not when the President is set to turn this into a third-rail issue should I choose to ever campaign against him. He will fry me six ways to Sunday for sending daughters and young mothers off to war -- and, quite possibly, for bringing them back in body bags.
What he did was light the bandwagon on fire. Because he knows what I know -- that American families are not prepared to put their daughters in harm's way.
So? Isn't the President jumping on your bandwagon?
In face, I do: Roper, Harris, Gallop -- they all come back the same.
You don't know that.
If I have to ask again, Senator, I'll be asking in front of cameras.
Well, how about this?
Are you?
Well, what? What, wh-what are you not telling me?
What, you, of c-- What are you talking about? Of course not. I'd be destroyed!
Years ago, in LA, I turned a trick on Sunset and Western. The guy was polite and didn't argue about the price. He parked his car and I took him to a house that I had an arrangement with. A fat Mexican woman was watching a TV and I told him to give her the twenty for the room. There were three or four small naked children playing on the floor and we had to step over them to get into the room. The room had a bed and a dresser. He lay on his back on the bed and I put a rubber on him and sucked him for a while until he was hard and then I eased on to him. About twenty minutes later there was a knock on the door and it was the woman saying our time was up. I felt kind of guilty because he hadn't come and I offered to reason with the woman and get another ten minutes, but he said it was all right and began dressing. When we were ready to leave the room he stopped me and... hugged me and kissed me on the cheek. He gave me an extra hundred as a tip and went back to his car. I remember being relieved that I wouldn't have to work again that evening.
Who says it's a he?
Shall we go away for a couple of days?
I'll be back home around three. If you're back by then we can watch TV or something... I guess what I'm saying is... that I hope you are back when I get home. Please be careful.
They wouldn't know.
What sort of task?
What of our marriage? Victor, we've had so much tragedy. I want this family to live again.
We need each other now, I need your comfort and strength, not separation and solitude.
I have no desire to see the world again, but if you order me to...
What? Oh, I don't know. Let me look.
We're gonna go to the next town and stop. We'll get a motel room. I can rest for a while and then figure out how to get some money. We're gonna need money. Thelma. How much money do you have with you?
I haven't come to you.
After God... before the waste-paper basket.
I... I don't understand.
Not if you stopped hurting people. Write the truth gently.
Yup. Claire... please, please tell Mr. Bebe that if he worried half as much about his scripts as he does about my private life, we'd make a lot better movies.
Uh-huh. You mean what if the public finds out I perspire? And wear slacks. And drive an old jalopy? What if they find out I'm a real person. Oh no! Say it ain't so! Not a real person!
It's a perfectly good car. It runs.
I know. 'This is a factory and we each have our jobs. The writer writes, the director directs, and the actress...'
Oh. Um, would it be terrible if I wanted to go home early?
Would you hold this for me?
A little naive perhaps but -- thank you -- armed with determination, a solid work ethic, and an indomitable belief in the future --
I'll never tell.
Because he was a real hero, Chucky. He was acting out of a deep instinctive decency, not out of some ego thing. He didn't expect the media to lionize him. He didn't expect a million dollar reward. He saved fifty-four people because something inside him, some fundamental love for his fellow man, made him rush into that plane when "good sense" told him otherwise. He was willing to settle for some credit cards he sold to LaPlante.... For how much, LaPlante? A couple of bucks? Did you give him enough for a decent meal?
It's a starting place.
Did I tell you we've expanded the search spectrum? We're including several other possible magic frequencies -- not just the hydrogen line anymore. I was trying to get inside their heads, y'know? And I started thinking, what other constants are there in the Universe besides hydrogen, and then suddenly it was so obvious -- transcendantals, right? So we've been trying variations of pi...
So who... Who s the man? Where is he?
Look, you don t tell me about some Godforsaken place where stuff so bad even I couldn t imagine it goes down and expect me to go quietly to sleep! What happened? Who s the guy? The Austrian?
What...?
Italian? The Mafia...?
All this is off the record, Chucky, because if John Bubber lives, Mister LaPlante is going to give him his assurance that there will be no more "misbehavior" on his part. What's more he's going to apologize.
I am. And you're Will. I've seen your picture, that's how I recognize you. I almost said something at the store, but it would have been awkward. Like this.
I wasn't expecting you.
Oh. Oh.
Back?
Hello.
...isn't it perfect!
Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway.
We're going for a walk.
Park Avenue and East 2nd. Take Centre to Canal, up the Bowery, Cooper and Third, left on 41st, come around on Park.
What?
Sixth is a parking lot north of 23rd this time of day.
Sixth, you got delivery trucks blocking traffic at Herald Square. Look, I make this trip all the time.
Greenbank?
The V.L.A.?
It's almost there. The hardest part is getting someone to sell us the telescope time.
We could be together again --
Peter -- if you can get him to do that for me he'd obviously do the same for you -- we could -- !
And you've got me all figured out?
Hush your mouth.
Just hold me.
I never told you, but when I first saw you on the podium, cleaning your glasses, I felt sorry for you. Nobody as young as you should be that serious. But I don't think that anymore.
You're with me even when you're away.
Okay, then, I'll take you to dinner.
Where's your phone? I have to call another taxi.
I was here yesterday.
How would you like to take me to dinner?
Are you hungry?
Take me somewhere.
The big one.
Hey, we're connected.
Mr Brown.
I've been hoping to run into you.
Hurt feelings department.
You are here safely.
This is a mistake. We better forget it.
Like what?
You know what I'm talking about.
You're rude. I mean, you're very rude.
See if you've been making it with my mother.
Well, is she your girlfriend?
C'mon, tell me. Don't be afraid.
Who did this to you?
C'mon, are you or aren't you?
This isn't funny! I happen to have a very important date in like five minutes!
Bud. Mary Sue ... Breakfast is on the table.
Noooooo!
Do they know them?
Where you going?
All this nothing? I've spent my life in this stinking desert. It doesn't get to Jake like it got to me. He doesn't mind being out here. He doesn't mind being nothing but a land broker. Big fish in a small pond, he says. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
Will you not come in?
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
I don't know how.
Hey.
Here.
Why?
Can I go too?
Why?
You never cared before.
There's so many I just can't keep track.
No.
In what way?
Can you be any more specific?
Will you need me for anything else, Lieutenant?
Was he funny-looking apart from that?
Well yes.
Bodeguita del Medio. It's the only place for mojitas...
Off a little alley with cobblestones. Hemingway went there...
Havana.
Yeah.
Those are white words, not ours.
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
Oh! And don't wave your hands about!
Nothing.
I'll be out in a minute.
Yes.
You're very flippant and perhaps wise, but not wise enough to see the truth, Louis.
Lenny, this shit's illegal.
Price he pays for being a scumsucking pig.
Define love.
Me bailing your sorry pale ass out of jail twice in the last six months.
There's no need to be afraid, sire.
I probably meant it when I said it. Doesn't Lucky Chuckie want to come out?
What are you doing?
Your stereo broke? God, I could hardly stand that. I live on music.
So you haven't heard this record yet?
You didn't have to spend your money -- ?
Travis, you haven't even played the record?
That is the most heartless statement I ever heard pass between human lips.
Mrs. Wheeler is dead.
Take it off.
It's Elijah.
Because you have to leave half an inch at the tip to catch the force of the ejaculate! BATEMAN I'm getting out of here. Where's your lithium?
The monkey.
Oh God, just get it over with.
It's okay, Craig. It all worked out, in an odd sort of way.
Wanda and Hartley. They lost Bear. He was their adopted son. A beautiful boy. Indian.
I wanted to come home, Grandmama - and I did. I came back to my home with you.
"If" I accept?! Of course I'm going to accept! it's what I always wanted!
Why does everyone have to act that way?
Vlad, stop acting this way! You're my friend!
And this is my future. This is who I am!
Hi.
Did you eat?
I... We have to bury Leon tommorrow...
And I said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.
Bought and p-p-paid for. Just like one of his goddamn statues. Well at least in the movie he married her!
John, throw me the keys.
Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
The trunk. It's locked.
I didn't like it.
I didn't run away. I left the flat.
Where are you taking me?
Will you ... would you kiss me?
Certainly, Mister McMurphy.
What is it you want? What?
Leave me be! Why are you doing this? Why are you picking at my sores... What is it that you want?... You want what? What's with you? I hope getting me thinking of everything that's wrong when all I want is to not do this has some purpose. What is it, Mom? No kidding.
... moving in the wrong direction... Away from when I even remembered what it was like to have a man to... anything... hold fucking -- sorry -- hands with, for Christ's sake. I was feeling like really bad that Dr. Bettes is married. Which is probably why I make poor Spencer hug me more than he wants to... Like the poor kid doesn't have enough problems. He has to make up for his mom not getting any. Oh, boy. Who needs these thoughts?
His racket?
Is it true? Wallace is captured?
Have women found you attractive?
Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- "he handles produce well." Which we already knew! The point is, you have a lot of the signs.
Fuck the community. There was this article my friends and I read. It was "25 Signs He's Great in Bed". It was very fascinating.
Pro boner? Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly?
I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... Which we already knew...
I don't know. I don't know.
Oh.
Who are they?
What is it?
It was a gift from the citizens of Aspen. I'm Mary Wells.
And this is Helen Carter.
I was at first. Then I was hanging on. Are you going far?
As far as -- Sonora?
-- That was the place... and you were the guy.
Why so remote, Addison? I should think you'd be at the side of your protegee, lending her moral support...
I'm not married. I wear it to keep the flies off. I must go. Let me pay for this.
That's Africa. There's an African in all of us, isn't there?
And the lies. Gamblers are born liars.
Do you believe in astrology?
It's not about winning. You know what your problem is? You take yourself way too seriously.
The ladies' - shall we say - lounge?
You must take me for a real idiot.
That's okay. It doesn't make you a bad person.
I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel temptations of peer pressure, I... turn to God and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but it works.
What are the boys like?
Don't worry, it's totally understandable. Most of the boys that matriculate at Oakwood are very upstanding gentleman, however there are the occasional bad apples.
I stay here because I am happy. Is that such a terrible crime?
Yeah, I guess you're right.
I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli. You, I thought, understood a widow's grief.
Not once. What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun.
Because you are... one of the most... incredible, bravest, most beautiful woman I have ever met. The efforts you make. Your courage and your dignity. I don't know where you got it? I honestly don't know how I would have handled all this if I were you.
Why should they?
Stop by later.
I wou- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on.
No. But I have a hangover.
They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met.
Well, it is nearly breakfast time anyway. I can't go to sleep. I have to be at work in three hours. You know how it is when you just sleep an hour or two, you feel worse than if you hadn't slept at all?
I was afraid they'd stop us an' wouldn't let us cross. But I tol' Granma. I tol' her when she was dyin'. I tol' her the fambly had ta get acrost. I tol' her we couldn't take no chances on bein' stopped.
How about what?
And probably never again. It's nothing personal. It's just...I know a lot of pilots. Maybe I'm immune...
You have to shoot him down....If he's smart, he'll turn away before that happens.
Uh hum.
You turn into him, check him out, identify friend or foe.
-- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass.
What?
I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it --
It was last year.
Well, what do you think?
Why do you think? About my staying?
You seem very sure about that.
Be not so long to speak I long to die.
It's closed... closed. We need one that's open.
No gas... car dead. We need gas. I don't want to get shot for running out of gas.
Yes. Very good.
-- Your act only works with an audience.
WHERE'S THE FUCKING CASH, NICK!
-- I know you don't suck at acting.
No.
I get real busy between two and four.
And you can't tell me who you are.
Do you have my work number?
Thank you.
Well. I can't stay.
When you start with that attitude... it's like I don't know who you are.
Maybe that makes a nice excuse.
I wish you'd stop trying to make me mad so I won't care for you... I wish you'd give me a little more of a chance.
What kind of mine?
You know something, Jack, you really are hopeless.
Two sides? You're Dr. Jeckle and Mr. Jackass.
I was never very good at history. Let me see -- there was Miss Olsen, and then there was Miss Rossi -- no, she came before -- it was Miss Koch who came after Miss Olsen --
You down?
Family?
Yeah -- that's me. The Happy Idiot -- a million laughs.
Funny thing happened to me at the office party today -- I ran into your secretary -- Miss Olsen. You know -- ring-a-ding-ding? I laughed so much I like to died.
He has his uses too.
That's a good one, coming from you.
Let it alone, Lenny. It'll take care of itself.
Well I haven't seen her in months. Who knows what's going on in her head. You're really running out of excuses to come around, aren't you?
You talked to Iris? When?
Not yet.
Well, stop the world.
Great.
So you're saying...What are you saying??
What makes you think so?
Shit. I think I started a fire.
Yeah, maybe ... No. God, I hate these cigarettes!
Yeah... No.
I'm telling you I don't care what time you think you're in. You're not William Starks. I don't believe in many things, but I believe in death. And it doesn't give back what it takes. So whoever you are...I did a nice thing, you've made me regret it enough already, so please, just leave.
No, it's not. It's December 25th, 2004.
I don't know. But he did die. STARKS falters under the news. JACKIE looks around, through her now blurred eyes, like she might find some help in the apartment. She settles for the BOTTLE of VODKA on the table, lowers the iron fork and takes a long heavy drink, then laughs nervously as she looks up.
I know what this is...I picked you up when I was drunk and you probably thought I'm just fucked up enough to fall for this. But the thing is I know what I'm doing when I drink. I just usually don't care. Right now, I do though. And I want you out. Now.
No, you didn't. They found William Starks' body dead in the snow.
I'm sorry.
Don't you think you should put them in water?
My cousin is the harbor master. You must not bring in drugs. You cannot be armed. If you're carrying, it has to go. Or stow it inside. No one will go near your boat...
Hello, Steve. I'm glad you could come.
Would you buy me a cup of coffee? In there...
Are you afraid? Good. And you don't need a visa. Cause you're with me.
Rosalind and Orlando. From "As You Like It"? Shakespeare?
Where's the old lady?
I may be a shut-in, but I do not lack for news. I'm sorry you had to go through all that.
You heard?
Tired... And I'm getting tired of being so tired. Other than that, I'm doing very well.
Oh, Ben - I miss you so when I'm out... How are you feeling?
No, it's been a good day - better than yours, from what I've been told.
No headaches?
So I can move on. You too.
James called me last night looking for you.
Penny for your thoughts.
This got a floor. Wouldn't leak when it rains.
Oh. Oh God. I don't care about anything. I don't care about anything! Take me to the bed.
Why, sure. It won't be so bad once we get her washed out.
That's necessary, huh?
My writing career! Your hair written by Clementine Kruczynski. The Tom Waits album is Rain Dogs.
I think. Anyway, I've tried all their colors. More than once. I'm getting too old for this. But it keeps me from having to develop an actual personality. I apply my personality in a paste. You?
And you ask questions, right?
Yeah, I got it.
My name's Clementine, by the way.
You know Okra asked me to marry him the other evening.
Johnny.
I'm sure she found your lectures fascinating.
Do I sit or stand?
Okay, pal... I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
Sorry.
And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you?
Oh, please...
Why? Juba was an African and you want to look the part -- hold still.
Those people? I doubt they'd think of this. Ooo, you're wonderful this color!
I've been surprised in an unguarded hour, But must not now go back; the love that lay, Half smothered in my breast, has broke through all, Its weak restraints, and burns in its full lustre. I cannot, if I would, conceal it from thee.
No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo.
If I am going to get through math today, you're going to have to bring me up to speed quick.
A little out of my element.
Sally did all this herself?
I'm a little nervous, so...
Oh, yes. You know Ryan's been sober eight years. And it's difficult if I... you know. It's better if I don't.
Destiny takes a hand.
It is, isn't it? You make millions of decisions that mean nothing and then one day you decide to order takeout and it changes your life.
How amazing.
It's silly, really. I mean, I'd seen him at the office, obviously I'd seen him, he's the associate publisher, and then one day we both ordered sandwiches from the same place, and he got my lettuce and tomato sandwich on whole wheat, which of course he was allergic to, and I got his lettuce and tomato on white.
Is Vanessa here?
Cool.
Huh?
Oh. It's fine. What's another ten pounds?
Oh, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!
Hmmmm.
I notice these things are back in fashion. Oh, honey. He's a lovely man, Annie.
The bridge won't wait!
You're still here?
Hi. Look, I'm kind of tired - I think I'll go to bed.
I-I really have to get up early for class tomorrow.
I'm taking a remedial high school art class for fuck-ups and retards.
So, someone else could have done it.
She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
That's ridiculous...
Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed.
I believe Agnes is different.
Two hundred.
Yeah, you're making us all nervous.
Are you riding with me, James?
When you get home, I'm asleep. When I leave home, you're asleep.
So now I suppose he's trying to make those two dancers feel as comfortable as possible.
Or have perfect table manners.
What?
Well, consider the source. I don't even know what a lady is.
Where did he get all that information?
I like it to be what it is. It's Sarah. That's a biblical name. You want to know its meaning?
There can't be very much-
I've got a lot to say. And none of it is easy.
I don't expect you to be pleasant.
I drink.
I don't intend to be.
Well... all right.
No. No more. I'm getting sleepy. Thank you very much, Mr...?
Pablo said no?
George. Oh, Jesus Christ, George. Look at you.
What happened to your hand?
I'm just going in to do my shopping.
No. Don't let it. You've come this far.
What?
No, on the porch.
I wouldn't have let you.
Look, Duff - most of the men I know - they're kind of sad. When I met you the other day I had a feeling that you're different. That's why I went out with you. I thought we might have something to say to each other.
That does it...
What's the matter with my brains?
That's disgusting!
So how long am I supposed to sit an' twiddle my thumbs in this place?
Hello?
Do you know your parents' blood types?
Seven years. One baptism? He's your mother's only brother
At times. At other times I think she was...more. But who would know that better than you. I mean, you sure 'nough you her.
Haven't seen her since that day. Ella thinks she might be waiting in the woods for another chance but..I don't think so. Mama thinks she's gone for good. Says she can feel it.
Yes?
I don't know. I think I've lost my mother, Paul D.
No. Not a bit all right. Hasn't gotten out of bed since that day.
I was a great dancer...
I better get the kids home.
I know you're not yet -- but you will be, soon.
Yes.
What?
Not particularly.
Yes.
When Mr. Powell's our Daddy then I can tell him about --
I try...
Grab an oar, find a way to weight it down, we're gonna need it. Cortez, help him. Flea? You take one of the two full minis -- and just follow my lead.
Would they hurt her?
God, these parties are the worst
You need to get outta here, Rapunzel
Would you like to start?
Who are you going to call?
Oh, God.
I know, I know.
Yeah.
So we got two full mini-tanks, three minutes each. 'Cool? How much air in yours?
You sure have.
You should go out every now and then, Gus; with some new ties the girls would be all over you.
Don't worry, Wyatt. My family's rich.
Wyatt! My God...
Yes.
I was faking it. I've been feeling caged for sometime. Funny, huh?
Responsibility, progress.
I'm talking about idealism.
I'll change back before we leave.
But do you stand for anything?
You're afraid of him.
We have to do something fun tonight this is my last weekend of freedom before I start my stupid job.
I know a party we could go to...
Let's get out of here, this place makes me sick.
I don't believe you.
If I promise you there's really a party with a lot of guys, do you promise you'll go?
What? Where?!
It's a surprise.
I'll be late.
You were the one who ran around with ice in his underwear, don't forget that.
Monks bottle their own wine. Don't they?
Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home.
I'm not in the fourth dimension -- -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out.
Siri, sandblast that thing. It looks like Trump Tower. Those mounds are supposed to be made of dirt and excretions...
We're going to war, aren't we. If they're doing all that it must mean we're going to war.
Well, what do you think?
Antibiotic.
Craig McDermott called. He wants to meet you and David Van Patten and Tim Price at Harry's for drinks.
Patrick Bateman's office.
Where are you?
Patrick? Is that you?
You look nervous.
She couldn't come I said. Are you nervous?
They're cancelling all leaves, all passes. No more drills. We stand at full ready starting--
Could you get this? I can't
Tranquilizer. Causes drowsiness.
I think I need a little air.
I'll drive, then -- we'll go out in a blaze of glory!
Who cares? Let's just go... what's stopping us?
I'm serious! I'm just so sick of everybody! Why can't I just do whatever I want?
Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
What's wrong?
Yeah, I have.
It's weird because "prom" is actually from the word "promenade". And you can't really promenade alone, can you?
Well, are you here with anybody?
Tell George and Jessica to try and cover everything without Tom having to ask additional questions.
I am not so well-born.
Pull out.
I know. Maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.
But then you'll get huge. Your chest is going to milktate. And you have to tell everyone you're pregnant.
I couldn't do it, Leah! It smelled like a dentist in there. They had these really horrible magazines, with, like, spritz cookie recipes and bad fiction and water stains, like someone read them in the tub. And the receptionist tried to give me these weird condoms that looked like grape suckers, and she told me about her boyfriend's pie balls, and Su-Chin Kuah was there, and she told me the baby had fingernails. Fingernails!
What are you doing here, dumbass? I thought I was supposed to pick you up at four.
Congrats.
What does that even mean? Anyway, I got to thinking on the way over. I was thinking maybe I could give the baby to somebody who actually likes that kind of thing. You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or something. Or some nice lesbos.
Keep your voice down dude, my mom's around here somewhere. She doesn't know we're sexually active.
I'm staying pregnant, Le.
Oh, gruesome. I wonder if the baby's claws could scratch your vag on the way out?
Turn the light on.
Up to six weeks, I think.
Yeah. There's two. Why?
... Matthew's six, Katie's four, and Beth's just nine months.
... just wanna be a good mom, a nice person, a decent citizen. Just wanna take good care of my kids. You know?
I wouldn't put it past him.
Of course it could -- Burgel's been trying to get me thrown out as long as I can remember. He could've killed Eduard.
How's the trout?
It is fish.
What way?
It's nice.
Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
You knew me as a kid.
Then... I guess you have to.
Here are two quarters. When you lose these, you're not going to get anymore.
Is that why you came all the way back? To ask a lot of stupid questions about Robin Hood?
Your desert island top-five.
Yeah, well... Let's see... What are you're all-time top five records?
Right. So. You must have an enormous record collection.
Well, I'm next. You won't hear anything like that, Mr. Galbraith. I'm not a popular favorite since I let the leopard loose.
Thanks.
Well --
And where exactly does that put your position...?
I don't know exactly.
Yes, sir--
I'm sorry, sir.
Mmm. Like kissing a rose. Well, au revoir.
Why not?
Yes.
Oh, great.
What?
How do you like it?
She'll be awright.
Wait! Professor...?
Oh. Did you find something here -- an envelope -- ?
I hit a few... uh, games on the way back.
My son... my mind...
Hmm. Pretty good.
Well, thanks.
Oh no.
And have fun at your bachelor party.
It's crazy in there. What's wrong with that doctor? He keeps mumbling, poking himself in the eye when he talks to me.
Thing is, I'm supposed to be the fuckup. The one on the stretcher in there--that's supposed to be me. With my parents crying out here. I got a lot of guilt, you know what I mean?
My father's in a coma, now my mother's going crazy. It's like she's in a trance.
Then you'd better start believing me.
I can makes things quite unpleasant.
In order to keep Elaine away from you -- I am prepared to tell her everything.
Do exactly what I say.
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin. You are not to see Elaine again. Ever. Those are my orders. Is that clear?
As long as it's not... gross, you know? Like some scar or something. It has to be like mine, like something about you.
That's what you said before.
Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent.
Jim, come on, honey, get down on your hands and knees and hunt for Jasper's Easter egg.
... Where are you taking me?
How do I know you won't keep them all?
Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures.
How thoughtful. The gift of inconvenience.
Home.
Where'd you all go? Motherfucking frat boys. You better hide. Is your life so pathetic that this is something you're willing to pay for?
See you around.
I don't drink coffee, Daddy. And this is not what we should be talking about.
I go to college. I thought you knew.
What's he talking about?
So many children. Are they all orphans?
Congratulations, Dick.
He's the--He looks like Ichabod Crane?
You're a long way from Whittier.
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Okay.
...I said, I like your hair.
...Pardon?
Hi, I'm Adele.
Carrie.
How many times you gonna tell me that?
I have no secrets from my family.
The cops didn't try and strangle my ass.
What do you think it is?
Shut your ass up and grab the wall!
You thought right... Now take your hands from around my throat, nigga.
Allison.
Will you relax, please? They're gonna love you, I know.
Yes.
Do you feel all right?
What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative.
You won't. I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff.
Adam?!
With a wildly beating heart.
You didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?
Then you'll die.
Don't do this. I am literally begging you not to do this. Chris.
They won't do anything to Junior, darling. Anonymous letter writers - I've got guards in front of the house, and I'm going to arrange -
Have they heard from father yet? Has he seen -
Please don't talk any more, Charles.
Here I am, darling... Darling!... Darling, it's all right... Mother's here.
I've tried to tell you, Emily. The President's going to be all right. He had a comfortable night. There's no danger of any kind.
They won't hurt you, darling. Mother's with you! Mother's looking after you!
Emily - you musn't leave me now - you can't do that to me.
Of course the line's just imaginary. You can cross it twenty times...nothing really changes.
You don't believe that.
Only when you're depressed. Then it passes.
No, are you kidding me, Bob, not at all.
Uh-huh.
Neither am I.
Don't hit me.
Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
Well, didn't you?
I asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.
Okay.
I told your partner, I can't help. I didn't see anything.
Tamina was a friend of mine. My shower was broken, she let me use theirs.
Alright.
Alright.
I know. I'm sorry.
Where Ben?
Ben where do you have to get to?
Ben. God doesn't like visitors.
Ask her, she's a heroic Fireperson. She does this twenty times a day.
You'll never guess what's happened!!
Yes. Yes, I'm fine... We need more brushwood! Why are you staring at me like that?
I lost the touch
Do you take sugar?
Give me back my anonymity, that's all I ask! Let me be invisible again!
Everywhere I go, they point and whisper! At the opera, they hiss at me when I take my box. When I went to church... the priest refused to even hear my confession; he said I was already damned! Why must I suffer for your sins?
Oh yeah...
What about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?
It was so cute how he had his own little bags. I thought I was going to start crying!... Do you think they're gay?
He was so excited when you bought that record -- you're a saint!... God, these apartments are super expensive...
I know... I still can't get over that his name was "Seymour."
That was truly pathetic.
Okay.
I ain't in a hurry.
I don't know... I thought...
Did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? It's not original. It's something I picked up from the Chink.
Really? The Chink, huh? I've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. What else have you learned from the Chink?
Learned from the Chink? Oh my. Ha ha. That's hard to say. We mostly.... Uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.
I wanted him to marry her.
It's my fucking life.
Why are they all pigs at Information Retrieval?
Don't touch me. Just take me home.
I thought I recognized you. You're Paul Benjamin the writer, aren't you?
That's okay. It's not really my business. I have wondered though. Why was it? Was it like a nervous breakdown?
...a little. I was a little tipsy. Don't call me pathetic.
Anyhoo, sweetie, I done a bad thing. I kinda sorta wrecked your car...
So what do we do for money when we get to New Orleans?
And that is?
Oh, God, sweetheart, no. There's nothing on Earth I love more than you. Nothing. I promise.
I'd love to read that.
You can believe that if you want to.
Last night I saw what has happened to you. The Rick I knew in Paris, I could tell him. He'd understand. But the one who looked at me with such hatred... well, I'll be leaving Casablanca soon and we'll never see each other again. We knew very little about each other when we were in love in Paris. If we leave it that way, maybe we'll remember those days and not Casablanca, not last night.
I don't think I will, Rick.
Yes.
I never forget, honey. I try, real hard. It's just, for some reason, I don't seem to be able to organize things right and -- when it comes to you guys, I end up falling short.
No, Rick. No, you see, Victor Laszlo is my husband... and was, even when I knew you in Paris.
We'll work out the roller hockey thing, okay? Whatever you want, we'll work it out. I promise.
Listen, it's one thing to have a guilt complex. But I know the difference between when I'm overstrung and when I'm seeing things that are simply not there! Besides, it only began after we moved!
When did you...?
Daniel...
Bullshit. You told me I'd get half a million dollars. You told me I'd be set.
Hi, sweetie. Were you a good girl? Where are Matt and Katie?
Mommy's having a party for me. I asked Robert, and Donald, and Lois --
That's terrific.
It's late, Mommy -- you haven't forgotten my birthday party.
Sometimes I think ALL men are fools!...
For what?
You wouldn't happen to have a little time right now, would you, Donna?
You know me. I pick things up real fast.
Yeah, but I'm gonna get better. A lot of these folks aren't.
Mass hysteria.
You all right?
You got him.
I want to keep it forever. I want to love you the way I do now the rest of my life. Don't you understand -- we'll lose it if we leave. I can't make an entire life disappear to start a new one. All I can do is try to hold onto to both. Help me. Help me not lose loving you.
No matter how much distance we put between us and this house, I bring with it with me. And I'll feel it every minute we're together. And I'll blame loving you for how much it hurts. And then even these four days won't be anything more than something sordid and... a mistake.
You've got to know deep down that the minute we leave here. It'll all change.
Robert. Please. You don't understand -- no one does. When a woman makes the choice to marry, to have children -- in one way her life begins but in another way it stops. You build a life of details. You become a mother, a wife and you stop and stay steady so that your children can move. And when they leave they take your life of details with them. And then you're expected move again only you don't remember what moves you because no one has asked in so long. Not even yourself. You never in your life think that love like this can happen to you.
We are the choices we've made, Robert.
I got ten marks for that.
Moreover...
You pay me.
Yes, I photograph very well. Look --
I don't see why it's unusual for a stenographer to be pretty -- if she does her work well, -- seems so silly. I don't know why they don't like girls like me in offices. Personally, I hate offices -- I'd much rather be in the movies.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. "Land-based maritime specialties." Gimme a second here to de-euphemize that...
"The Lark Report."
Well, I'm just an old dame without much time left, so you'll pardon me if I jump right in here before they discontinue my blood-type. I am deeply concerned over the Navy's seemingly incontrovertible attitude toward women in the military. Case in point...
The Navy's conclusion regarding the crash of an F-14 aboard an aircraft carrier. Female aviator, it just so happens. You're familiar with this report and its conclusion, am I right?
Yes, I see your signature right here -- twice the size of everyone else's. And your conclusion was "pilot error," hmm?
Have you looked?
You've been around.
Mmm you never know. They might. He's just trying to do the nice thing.
It moved me. I did relate to it -- I really did. It was unusual for you to cut to yourself when you tear up -- and that might not have been my choice...but it's real and it got me...and I think a lot of the time I'm too conservative about that kind of stuff. Okay?
You look better without make-up.
Darling, I don't care - really I don't. Sidney'd had a secret crush on me for years, but nothing we do is his business -
It's a map, I think that's what it is.
And I'm going to eat his breakfast cereal, too, even though it tastes like boogers. And...and...
All right, hard guy. Get up and bleed on the rugs.
What's the trouble, Asta? Your balloon busted? So's mine.
Sit down!
Where you headed?
My Dad was funny?
Do you like her?
So. What happens now?
No! I mean... why so soon?
C'mon, how often do you talk to somebody who's been on the cover of Time. Three of four times.
He said he'd kill me.
Listen, that was my fault.
Yeah.
I guess I'm supposed to do it in the morning. Identify him.
If I had known I was going to have company, he was right next to me. I think he heard me peeing! I hate that, I am glad he's in jail.
Almost.
She left Phoenix a week ago yesterday. And no trace until...
Will you help us? I think something's wrong out there!
But... but wait a minute. We're supposed to be different, right? Clifford says... This theatre is supposed to be different! And this play... this play is all about what greed and money do to people!
Does Clifford even know? You didn't tell him, did you? I'm gonna tell him. Where is he?
Did we go sailing?
A pocketful of rye...
Four-and-twenty blackbirds.
"Mocky-Lock is the bogeyman, Mocky-Lock wants me where I am."
Mocky-Lock is a pain in the ass.
I think I have... I could be wrong. I have been before. Just remember one thing. If you're not Top Gun, if you're not fighting jets, you're not gonna be able to act like a fighter pilot... You're gonna have to act like the rest of us. You're gonna have to master humility. For you guys, that's the toughest maneuver of all.
Hey, I never said I was a fighter pilot...I never claimed to think it was fun to be shot off the end of a ship in a storm. I can find contentment in a good book. I don't have to roar by someone at Mach two with my hair on fire. Sometimes...I just get happy being with the right man.
And I'm gonna sneak off, and be by myself for awhile, like until I can think of a new career...hotel management or something...
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they were like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.
It's the Gibson, it's finding us too fast.
Well, sometimes when we get 'em, they're not completely dead, you know, like when they cut a chickens head off and it still runs around crazy.
Know what?
Anyone with fifty bucks could tell you that.
I'm the only person you've told? That's a great line. Does that make other girls swoon? Do they actually eat up this bullshit?
Oh? There's proof now?
God, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.
What!?
That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear?
One of my suitors.
Why?
Just look at them!
He a dog babydoll. He a great dane. I tried to tell y'after ya'll first date. He hit that ass one time, his interest in a bitch start t'landslide.
This is insane. You've got no proof.
"The Angel of Flight 104!" You're telling me you're the A...?
I wasn't driving. I'd left the car in the parking lot at the airport. Could it have been deliberate?
What about?
Maybe we should just listen to the radio.
You play all these places?
Jesus, you fellas've made a lot of noise. What's with the stars?
You're lucky, Chucky, you... OW!
No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
Well, that's good news, my boy.
Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
Hold me --
-- Yes?
Tell me you love me -- tell me you love me now --
But those are our people...
We haven't talked since high school.
Hon?
Funny how so many people wanna buy carpet on a Friday night. You'd almost think they's want to forget about it for the weekend.
'Bye, honey. I won't wait up.
I can't. I work.
I write for you sometimes.
You're not going to take your suit off!
Billion.
They decoyed the little General off to a tea party to keep him out of the Senate.
Some public official skipped a week on his Christmas Club?
I don't mind who gets licked in a fair fight, Diz. It's these clouts below the belt I can't take. Sicking that horrible dame on him--when he's goofy about her--
Paine.
I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
Oh.
Yes.
Look, old man, you stay out of this. We spend a fortune on you, more than we can possibly afford, and all you do is criticize, morning to night. And then you think you can -
I'm not sure. You mind checking right ascension 18 hours, 34 minutes; declination plus 38 degrees 41 minutes?
Put it on speakers.
I don't know. Big. Dark.
'Dear Miss Laury'...He spells it with a Y instead of an I...E...Wouldn't you think he'd know...
He's like the biggest idiot of all time!
Jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.
I'm going to Daikanyama, do you want to come walk around?
Because I'm not allowed to. I still do, after work. So, what? Should we just break up? Is that what you're saying? Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.
But what?
You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you. If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.
"Both women, in their 20's, charged they had had intimacies with Elijah Muhammad since 1957..."
"Los Angeles, UPI: Elijah Muhammad, 67-year-old leader of the Black Muslim Movement, today faced paternity suits from two former secretaries who charged he fathered their four children..."
We'll get to that, too, but this isn't just talk any more.
The talk is everywhere!
To Bembry? Is Bembry your friend?
This is the one thing I like about this house... want some lox?
People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
Sure. Zack, I hope you know I didn't have to show you that picture.
Margo in the Cub Room. I couldn't be more surprised if she'd said Grant's Tomb.
It's OK, Booth, it's no big deal.
He doesn't slobber, he just snores. And I told you we haven't...done anything in over a year.
What?...Oh, no, THX. That's not true. Not satisfied? THX, I need you so much.
No, no, I'll go -- just give me a list.
You picked up that girl right in front of me.
I'll write you ten poems. Bye.
Good evening, Mr. deWitt.
You're a cold-hearted bastard, aren't you? How'd you ever get so mean, Auggie?
I do not. How do you do?
I distinctly remember striking your name from the guest list. What are you doing here?
Aren't you?
I'm not pregnant. I'm hot. I'm too hot.
I'm fine. I got hot.
Iced tea.
Would you like something to drink?
It never crossed your mind?
With good reason. They fucking worship you as it is.
It's like a song.
Rats! They fought the dogs and killed the cats, And bit the babies in the cradles, And ate the cheeses out of vats. And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles, Split open the kegs of salted sprats, Made nests inside men's Sunday hats, And even spoiled the women's chats, By drowning their speaking With shrieking and squeaking In fifty different sharps and flats...
When the game's over, I guess.
The Pied Piper of Hamelin. By famous Hanover city; The river Weser, deep and wide, Washes its wall on the southern side; A pleasanter spot you never spied; But, when begins my ditty...
It makes me sad.
What does it say?
Graphical interfaces. For Skywire? I'm s'posed to coordinate with you.
Yeah? I ran it for lots of platforms, ranging from the narrowest bandwidth to --
You were never thirteen, Mom.
Who do you think I'm doing this for? I'm doing this for you!
Please --
I don't think so.
What's going on?
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. Come lets away.
What? What?
Well -- then it's gotta be a different than what's in our water, cause ours is okay. The guys from PG E told me. They sat right in the kitchen and said it was fine.
In and out.
If you want, I got a pack in the room.
How's egghead?
It's the waves. God's music, my mother used to say. She was crazy for the ocean.
La Hire, I'm warning you -- don't swear!
Get his wine away.
Can't say. It's something can't be planned.
I likes yellow.
Blue. That doesn't hurt nobody. Yellow neither.
What I have to do is get in my bed and lay down. I want to fix on something harmless in this world.
That's the last thing they took from me.
I better do this, Stan.
Ms. Kruczynski?
Hi.
How are you today?
Anyway, I've got to do my tap dance here.
'kay.
Okay, I guess.
Here we are.
Just feels like the car behind has been following us the longest time.
No. We shouldn't touch that money. We don't know about that money. That might be dangerous money. You have to start all over again. You look like a brand new person and you can be a brand new person... whoever you want to be.
Does she have a pancreatic ulcer?
frowns at Henry.
Yvonne hasn't been herself, either. Locking herself away in her room . . . endlessly writing.
What're you doin', baby?
Goin' where?
Llewelyn.
Why?
I was asleep in mum's guest house. INT. SOPHIE THOMAS MANSION -- BEDROOM -- NEXT Domino is asleep in bed. The TELEPHONE rings.
Hello?
Either this was some kind of set up... or the First Ladies got scared... decided to pull out and cut their losses.
Oh, look, I'm sorry it didn't work out.
I was so bored!
Thanks for a swell time.
This crowd wouldn't know the difference! They're embalmed!
At least I'm open to new concepts!
Yes.
Have they done blood tests on him?
Since forever.
How long has he been having problems?
Emergency room only.
Only in the emergency room or when he was well.
What's funny?
Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone? Pathetic and alone.
What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little light headed.
What did he say?
Fuck.
Shit.
Yeah, yeah, go on.
What the crap?
Do they believe in reincarnation? I believe in reincarnation.
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME?! WHATEVER YOU GONNA DO TO ME, JUST DO IT! AND LET ME GO!
You some kind'a pervert?
Some crazy Jesus freak, gonna fuck the spirit into me...
And I can say the same thing about my daughter! But she is suffering! Can you solve that problem! I can't deal with this now, Liz! If you need a yes or no right now, then no -- don't do it! Not until I know Grace is all right. Now, please! Just do what you can. Okay? Please.
Oh...
Well, what are you doing... what are you doing with-
Yes, it is.
But that's what you were thinking. And that's okay. Because I know you love me. Not like it is with Susan, the way your eyes light up when she comes in the room and the way she always gets a laugh out of you, as opposed to me when I walk in a room and that look comes over your face, "What does she want now?"
That you've been to Susan?
It'll take the pain away.
I'm tired. I want to go home.
Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
What are you doing here?
I - I guess I fell asleep.
Who are you?
Miss Harrington...
Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
How did you get in here?
No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
Then let's talk about something else...
No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
Agnes...
I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
Yes I do, but I want you to...
What do you mean?
You can't. You're going to be Valedictorian.
Yeah, yeah. I'm taking a big gamble. I've loved him for a long, long time.
Lie down!
You were meant to You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to.
Vision? I'm a walking anachronism! I've upset my parents. I miss my kids. I could be trapped here forever! And poor Charlie...I got pregnant on my 18th birthday and we had to get married. Tomorrow's my birthday! I've got to get out of here now.
The difference being what -- that I refuse to adopt the standard line, that I don't care about the results of my work? Well, I do care. Of course any discovery has to be verifiable, of course it must be subject to all rigors of scientific method, but I refuse to go around pretending I'm some kind of dispassionate automaton when it's obvious to anyone with a brain I'm just not.
You can't just pull the plug, David.
It's not enough having my search time systematically cut down -- you know I'm down to three hours a week now.
I'm searching for patterns in the noise, that's all. Order in the chaos. I'm practicing listening --
Meaning...
No. You re looking at a real Musketeer here, Whitney. Brave and rash. Had to dash in there. Take a prisoner... Might as well have sent them a notice to quit... Come on, Musketeer! Got anything to say?
Probably.
You mean like you loved Mom?
...There's a start for a meeting.
I thought you were in a meeting--?
We taking bets? What if you're wrong?
Go ahead, say it.
You got a deal.
No. You were right, I was wrong... ...Max.
I used to play this piece back in high school.
Terry!
You demand to be served. A fork fetishist.
Okay. Shall we clean up around here first? Do you think it's all right--
The documents are forged.
Isn't everybody part of everybody else?
And find the treasure, and get it, and get back to the Humvee, and get the hell out of Iraqi without getting our heads blown off, but that's about it.
We make it, or we go back empty handed.
Probably was a couple of hundred years ago when whoever drew the map came through here. Worn down to nothing now.
For some, eating is a sensual experience. The sensual experience.
Mary Janes, Mom. You promised.
We re almost done here...
Look at me like you haven t seen me every day for the last twelve years...
Sorry, Jack. It s too important to me.
What made you want to be a fighter?
Pull over.
I'm not applying to college.
Yes, one of many.
No.
This is my thirteenth pair.
Why does it sound exciting? There's absolutely nothing exciting about it.
Oh. Congratulations.
Hello. You're sleeping in a tuxedo.
Booties for my father. He gets cold in this hospital.
Oh. My condolences.
Goodnight.
You best leave that quilt alone. That was grandma's quilt.
Morning, ma'am.
Don't be silly. Church is not going to die.
But what if he dies and has to go to the Pet Sematary?
We can discuss all this some other time, Susan. Right now -
Honey, Church will be fine.
Missy Dandridge. And she says it's a operation!
I asked Harry about it. He didn't own up to it. He said he didn't know what got into Okra.
You're blowing your only chance. Act like I'm Gino.
We're not really interested, Henry.
Don't move!
You won't forget it?
Of course.
How are we gonna do this, Nick?
Bullets or no bullets, he won't do it.
No.
They all are. Football's on.
Why?
Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
The show must go on.
Boats. All anyone talks about is the wind. Is it up, is it down. I can't live with a man who only talks about the wind.
Do you think Miss Channing would approve?
Tim's jealous, you know? He wants to have ideas too.
Leave him alone, Tim.
It's nice here. It's different.
Maritime. Jose will fill you in.
And what is that?
What do you like to drink?
How fast does that go?
Show me...?
If you grew up to he anywhere near as good a man as your father was, I would be happy! I would be thrilled.
Any words you don't know you can find in the dictionary.
You won ten dollars. Big deal. If we don't get a good ride before dark we could miss your ship.
I don't need any money for the baby. I'll be fine.
The cook again?
If I ever run into that guy, I'm going to kick his ass.
It'll tell you pretty much everything about us...
He's in Palermo.
It's Grace.
You get lonely?
Long as I live I'll never Get used to that sound.
Leave.
... and that Christmas dinner, when Cook made that awful plum pudding and we hid it in our pockets so we wouldn't hurt her feelings! I do remember so much now, Grandmama, - but not everything.
Leave.
Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
Here are the slips for the laundry and the cleaning. They'll be ready on Saturday.
He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
I suppose you want to know about that silly book of yours.
You? Frighten me? That's a good one! I'm twice as fast as you are. Who'd have thought such a spent body can still boast such a fertile mind?
I put myself at life and limb. Surely that's worth a few louis.
You mean -- break in?
A what?
But they'd still get the idea, right?
It's a standard GUI. Once I've got a concept, it's maybe three day's work.
Before they kill somebody else, too.
You haven't even seen it!
Are you okay?
The Conformist.
For now. But I wouldn't be if I thought this was the end of the evening.
No. Just you and me. We get some proof, then tell them. Hippy, look... if was can prove to Coffey it's not Russians, maybe he'll ease off the button a little.
Uh-uh! Not a chance! There's nobody in this town doing anything with his life, except what his father did, which is nothing. If I can't have more out of life than that, I'd rather be dead!
Don't you dare ask me that question. I'm an adult and you got no right to push your nose into my affairs like that!
Are you saying accepting your help obligates me!?
Yes I do!
Hello?
He totally freaked. I've never seen him like this. He's out of his fucking mind.
What happened?
It's me.
All right, Caesar.
What if he doesn't run?
It's all right, Violet. It's working. All we got to do is wait him out and see what he does.
Believes it! Jesus, it's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him. I don't know, Corky, I don't know what he is going to do. I'm getting nervous, really nervous.
That's okay, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.
My guess is male, somewhere in his 40's or 50's.
Like the last time.
Like the last time.
I don't want it to be just one of our parties.
Exactly what I mean. It's all ruined.
Okay.
Oh Frederick.
Oh that's absurd, Frederick. No, no Frederick, that's all wrong! John is happier and more fulfilled now than he has ever been in his entire life. And, that is completely due to you.
Frederick, just what is it that you are saying?
...Freddie! What's the matter? You've been like this all evening.
Oh, Freddie. What could that wretched vampire say to upset you?
Just because.
We're not.
What about me? Am I not even here?
So why did you come here?
Hanging an innocent man to win an election!
And what do you tell yourself now?
-- or lack thereof?
Good night.
I told you. I knew it was there. Didn't I tell you?
Oh. I forgot.
No. We came down the hill a little fast and... ...the wheel broke. Can you fix it for us?
Too much excitement. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Do you think you won?
I'm talking about a promise. You proposed to me!
What the hell are you talking about? We're engaged.
No. I just came back for a second. I wanted to get those bonds.
I think it's closed.
I figured you did.
Yah. Now I'm hungry again.
You'll be fine, Ellie. Now you can be excused. Go and wash your face.
Thank you, Louis.
Oh, yah. Norm made some eggs.
Bullshit.
I thought you got through that pretty well.
Please don't be negative, Drew, we have an acceptance list that would do The White House proud -- The Secretary-General of the UN, the Chairman of the FCC, nine Senators, I don't know how many Congressmen, and at least twelve of the Fortune '500'.
Weird what you remember.
Pike never confessed.
Chloe's dead.
Do you care?
It was the smart move on her part.
What do you get out of it?
Till it's in a powder. The energy exits within you...
Sheriff Buddy was a different story. Long as Roderick throw his weight the right way on election day, make sure all the colored get out to vote- we was called colored back then, if you was polite--maybe throw a barbecue for the right people now and then, things was peaceful. That Sheriff Wade, though, he took an awful big bite.
Wasn't legal to sell liquor in a glass back then unless you was a club, see. Roderick used to say, "Buy yourself a drink, you get a free membership." But Sheriff Wade, he could shut you down anytime.
Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
You're too late, Toby. We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.
What's your name anyway?
I should get back.
They've got me. Different thing.
It can happen so sudden, can't it? Being left out on your own.
You don't want to be Sheriff.
You're not listening. Really know what you're going to do before you do it.
No, you do not.
Get some perspective, Lowell.
It never used to be. You were two left feet on the dance floor. Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step.
Come on. What were they, Jake?
I'm sorry Charlie.
I'm already free...
I am ready now...
Do you know where fuse box is?
That's it. It's over. Get out.
I mean the armchair!
...yes, I've got that bit...
I tried to.
No. Please.
Sam! Why call when we can go?
Please -- if you... downloaded... everything about us you know the problems we face, the impact it could have -- it could make the difference --
Money.
Can't you have a normal conversation?
You mean care what you say? I'm worrying about other things.
-- I wear the sweater because I'm cold. I read because no one talks to me. My hair is my hair. What is it exactly that's bothering you?
You don't know me.
Because, growing up, books were my world.
You treat me like a loser.
I don't think you can take it personally--
I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I called what's his name at Warner's. He said he'd take a meeting -- in July. I've fought for you Viktor... You want to talk severance?
-- Christ, Viktor, look around. What do you think pays for all this? This is about investment and return. Those days in New York... that's... it's over.
How can I? Your last three pictures tanked. The board is giving me hell. No bankable star will work with you after this. If you just compromised... a little.
I'm just going to keep asking until you answer. I'm sure there's plenty of tape.
New ground?
Yeah, you're right. But I never claimed to know everything like you, and have all these little theories. I'm still learning, I know that. But I don't feel like I've wasted time. If I had to go through my marriage to get to where I am right now, fine.
"Because"? That's not good enough. I asked you a question, Graham. I asked you "how does it feel"? How does it feel, Mr. I Want To Go Down On You But I Can't? Do you know how many people you've sucked into your weird little world? Including me? Come on, how does it feel?
Why not?
Boom!!! Boom!!!
Passion...
Right. You're like it's just this instinct. It's like this animal instinct is taking over you. It's like...
Eat
Eat my - ah!
Just think 'I'm gonna do it!' Program yourself. See yourself making it. It'll happen. I know 'cause I just read this article in Cosmo, and it was about that very thing.
Of course, I'm always happy. Unless I'm bored. That blonde Woman, is that your wife?
Are you asking me that?
It's all important --
I said get out.
Please! Will you just --
Get away, Svengali.
Listen, you bumble-headed baboon --
Think you'll make it all the way to getting your wings?
That's what I'm afraid of. "Any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Your sister was telling me a pretty funny story about you, when you guys were kids and you were building a ramp for your dog and you threw a hammer through a window? Is that right? You threw a hammer through a sliding glass door?
I'm sorry. I thought you said --
I thought you said you bought all that pudding --
That's insane. That is really, really crazy. That's just crazy if you spend three thousand dollars on pudding.
So that was your pudding?
You'll try again tomorrow?
Don't yell at me! I know it's here! I know it!
No. You are mistaken. Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever. I asked what was wrong with my son.
And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right!
How long will you set it for this time?
Well, that's...considerably shorter than before. I was wondering, Calvin, why set the locks at all. I mean the radiation is gone and...
No one's forcing you to listen.
He's a writer, not a madman.
Once or twice.
I don't know. 'Cause you're cute.
I ain't no movie star. I'm just in high school.
You don't talk very much.
You're wrong. You're about to make the biggest mistake of your life. Put that gun down.
It's a container. Break the seal.
Nick, I love you --
Nick, what are you --
Nick --
Nick, it won't work. It won't work!
How's Harry?
I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life.
Not a real fan of Halloween humor, Will.
I'm gonna head back to the office... finish up some things.
He says it's a box.
Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
The Sheriff.
Sure, they go back to Cortez. When he rode by, they were squatting in a hut cooking hamsters for dinner.
Spanish, please. My mother would have a heart attack.
I'm unmarried. I'm not available.
He was deaf when he wrote this.
What about the obvious remedy? Reversing things. Maybe getting a job on a newspaper.
Well, come on -- it is your life. Nobody is tying you to the fast track. Did you go to college?
I trust you.
So, you're not well educated and you have almost no experience and you can't write.
I don't know if you can choose that, Rafe.
Do one thing for me, before you go.
Why, honey, it makes folks happy to see a girl that way--makes folks sort of giggly an' happy.
Thank you. I understand you're an interior decorator.
Yes.
Whoever's behind my husband's death, why have they gone to all this trouble?
Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
What... ?
Where'd you get this?
I think I would remember. What makes you think it's me?
Do you want to wait to hear me describe death?
It was wonderful.
When you've got money, you'll pay.
The Abbe's sending me away. He fears for me here, what with the likes of you --
When I'm sober. They get a little mixed up when I'm drunk. Most of the time they're mixed up.
Mm hmm.
Take your choice. I've got enough so we won't have to go out of the house till Tuesday.
I'm getting treatments right here.
Look, it's Dr. Tom. Hey, Dr. Tom!
My chiropractor!
Maybe I should just move to China. One kid per family, that way you don't lose your room.
Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you.
It's like the last time. He sent me a present before he --
Is that why Uncle Phil moved there?
Oh Vada she's so beautiful.
Margaret's my middle name, but everybody called her Maggie. Los Angeles, have you ever been there?
Well, it must mean something. She was obviously very sentimental.
Put down that gun, Earl.
You're not going to shoot me, Earl. I'm your friend, remember? I've got to write that story about your "Production for Use".
I'm told it's worth about a million dollars, maybe more.
Mm, you want to steal it?
So, he put aside some jewelry for me. A lot of jewelry.
Uh unh.
No, it's not.
Good, Lenny. I can see why the detective gig didn't work out. Come on.
No. They must have sent it to my beach house by mistake.
It wasn't an intrusion. And if it was, it turned out to be welcome.
No--keep it down. I want to feel the air.
I'm okay--I can walk.
Awful. I can't tell you how sorry I am.
Well, you know, "The Whole Thing's Theatre..."
You haven't even looked at them once.
It needn't be; not if you've another story.
You never said anything. About the drapes.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
Wrong number.
What's the matter?
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Are you writing a poem?
You're Alfred Beidermeyer aren't you?
It's different with men.
How'd you feel about it?
Really?
I'm asking how you feel. Does it bother you?
No. I just think... anything can be explained. But Mary, doing a thing like this... I don't know how to handle...
My ass ain't the same.
I don't know anything about these things, Jorge ...
Even if they did... that's all we have, isn't it?
We don't have much time left! Go on! Go on!
You here to see my mother?
I mean really! That business with your tongue. What is that? That's disgusting!
You know good and damn well what I'm talkin' about.
Where you goin'?
We been seein' you all along the way.
What's going to happen to Dolores?
That's because you had a proper upbringing.
Uh-huh.
What's the magician's weapon?
Constantly. Night and day. And unless I get up before the birds, I can't get in any practice time for myself...
There were some noises. I didn't want to disturb you.
Where have you been staying?
Give her a minute. Hello, Valentine.
Yes, of course. How much do you need?
Awaiting his arrival.
1976. What happened back then?
Completely unaware.
It was there. This angry music all by itself. And I heard whispering.
But this can't be real. This is nonsense.
What are you doing... ?
Yes.
That's very nice.
I'm so glad. You know, I recognize that passage in your book. The bit about us running into each other in the movie theatre.
Nine...nine, yes? Nine years, just about.
Oh yes. Nineteen...just. I'm cold.
I know you changed it to a bookstore. And the color of my hair. But the moment was exactly the same. The same, you know, dynamic. And almost verbatim, wasn't it?
Well, what?
All I said was that it sounds like a good idea.
You just ask them questions?
Yeah, I know. I'm fishing.
Right here. "Albert Lucas Trumbo." And all the others. I knew them all. So did you. We went to school with most of them.
I don't, really. I was referred to him.
Oh, really.
Do you know him?
Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here.
Caesar is your husband?
Through the door. It comes apart.
You're not working at Random House, I talked to them.
Twenty-seven fifty-three... do you see it? That must be it...
You're taking the kids. And moving to San Francisco.
I'm only a laundress; not a detective.
Oh, I-I left it at your house.
Oh no. I couldn't let it out of my house. You'll have to finish it here.
Yes, he's very bright, dear. Much like his father. But you know, Calvin, maybe he's a little...young for school.
Just do it!
Mummy!
Why did he tell you?
Would he know?
Is he a winner?
What does he do, this Bert Gordon?
Is that what makes a winner?
Maybe. Point is...not me.
I want to give you something. Will you let me?
Doc...
Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal.
Doc.
I'd like to see his house but...I don't know if I'd have the nerve to just go up and knock on his door. I don't think I can go through with it.
Girls don't love their father? Since when? Since I got to be sixteen?
God, Daniel, I'm not going to make Agent Orange.
Something is going down. Something bad.
We'll see? What does that mean?
Get out!
Where'd you get him that parka?
Struggling, why?
Why?
I was just going to.
Didn't you hear what I said?
Why, mother?
Would you like me to?
And did you find the leopard?
Do you think you're the only one who feels anything? Is that what you think?
No.
He's sleeping.
I can't see you tonight.
It's me...
I have to go somewhere with Mr. Eddy.
You should be more careful.
I know. But the toxicologist I been talking to? He gave me a list of problems that can come from hexavalent chromium exposure. And everything you all have is on that list.
Who's he in trouble with then?
Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you.
Not word one.
No I ain't.
How come?
Llewelyn can take care of hisself.
Parry Parry?
Oh my God, I look awful.
Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give himself a patriotic address.
That's right.
The ranger's notices? No idea at all.
No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. I'm not supposed to tuck him in and give him his bottle. That's McGann's job.
Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain just to tell a Boy Ranger what time it is. What do you need me for? Get somebody else--get a registered nurse--
I don't understand you. What is the problem?
There have been messages for you. A Lieutenant David Wills called from the Allied Kommandatura Cultural Affairs office in Wiesbaden. I don't know who he is.
As I said, then it's God, right?
He wasn't crazy. In the beginning I was upset. I think I really hated him. But then, with time, I understood what he said...and your silence too.
It's the first time I've had to chance to tell the story. I never mentioned it to anybody.
Then it's God, right?
But what if Solaris is what there was before The Big Bang?
What difference does it make to find an explanation? That's the way it went. But Alfredo didn't betray you, he was the only one who really understood you. Salvatore, if you had chosen to be with me, you'd have never made your films. And that would have been a pity! Because they're wonderful, I've seen them all. But you shouldn't have gone and changed your name. You should have kept your own.
Even a God that wasn't active, that just created something and stood back and watched?
Bulllllshit...
Jeff. You know, I was talking to Mister Brooks yesterday. He has this friend in New York who wants to sublet his apartment for six-fifty a month. I could swing that. Six-fifty.
Jeff. Jeff.
How?
I can't believe I agreed to do this.
I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you?
Do I go right away or do I have time to take a bath?
Bill? Have I gone crazy, Bill?
You were hoping for a kind word?! You're my mother! You're supposed to nourish me! Support me!
I was hoping for a kind word, little sister.
I have!
No! You're not talking now. You listen. You can send me away, Lillian, you can pretend I'm crazy and pretend I'm still your little girl who can't take care of herself, but one thing you can't pretend anymore. You can't pretend I love you because I don't. I can't. Not after what you've done to me. Because you see... I'm still me... I'm trying real hard all this time to be me... and you, 'little sister', you haven't been any help at all. Okay, boys, I'm ready.
But what --
That I am...
So it was "love".
Okay. Let's just see if a mugger gets me.
And die laughing, because you're walking so stupid!
That's the dumbest walk I ever saw!
And "is"...?
No.
I'd like to.
When did you start drinking coffee?
He needs me. Without me all that money is just gonna sit over there in Cabo. Sugar?
He told me last night.
It's a lot of money. About a half-a- million dollars. All of it in Cabo in safe deposit boxes and more comin' in.
He had his doubts at first. But he's always trusted me an wants more than anything to believe he still can.
We talked.
He came by.
Stop this!
Don't say that.
I'm hungry.
Y'know, I'm sort of psychic.
And I didn't like that man.
I know a man who needs a refill.
No, stay. Just for a little while. Refill?
Drink up, young man. It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.
My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose.
But they're so boring. All small stuff.
Oh yeah? On your own a lot, Huh?
And you're sure it was a woman?
Don't worry about it. Your attitude sucks anyway.
No, she flew up to Boston for another charity event. She'll be sorry to have missed you.
I think what my most insightful friend is saying, Mr. President, is that we welcome the inevitable seasons of nature, yet we are upset by the seasons of our economy.
If you got a good one, Wick...
They had to kill 'em?
Wick. They got your crew, too?
You really came back for more? Of this?
That's a good story.
You did. Yesterday you said, and I quote, "I have a date with Roger from Op Ed tonight and I'm going to do it with him."
I love that. That's my type.
That's what I said.
I don't know.
Good. Now if you'll just go along with Mister Washington, he'll see that you're properly oriented.
All in good time, Mister McMurphy. All in good time.
No, really, we mustn't get discouraged.
Please use your time to familiarize yourself with your new home and if there is anything you need to know, don't hesitate to ask us.
This is your bed. You may leave your things in that cabinet.
Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh?
'Course it does.
Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice.
You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business.
All right, that's enough. You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk.
I get that. The job first. Everything else, especially me, second. I get it. I don't like it.
Who's going to do it?
Look, spare me the macho bullshit about your gun...
Look, Jack, if you make everything your personal responsibility, you'll turn into a bad cop. It's not a practical way to function...
Here it comes again ... the sacred job...
It doesn't matter, alright. Just leave it alone.
"A habitu of cemeteries, his proudest conquest was a maid six decades his senior, deceased a dozen years."
It's not your cup of tea, Mama.
"The vigor with which he made love caused her bones to dislodge. Still, he granted her the highest compliment he accorded any woman..."
It was, the plague
Suppose, she isn't dead. Suppose it was a cataleptic attack?
You're hurting a lot of people, Frank --
A Volkswagen!
You have to say that. You're my teacher.
I've got to think of Emily -
Go ahead.
What lesson? Not to expose fraud when I see it? Not to fight for the right of the people to own their own property? Run it the way I said, Reilly - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated -"
I don't have to. I run a newspaper with half a million readers and they're getting a martyred president this morning with their breakfast. I can't help that. Besides, they all know I'm married to his niece. I've got to think of her.
Dad, you have to teach me to suture this weekend.
Who told you?
Actually he said "glad." 85.
Dennis Wilburn called from Arizona to say he's faxing in the new Tidwell offer on Thursday morning, and you'll be happy.
What?
The proprietor of his workplace is the only friend of his we know about. His address is in this envelope with Leonard s address, keys and other things you might need.
I had to see Bobby. I know you really don't like Bobby, but there was a problem and I didn't think you would understand.
What were you doing in my room?
I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
He's in love with a girl who's dead. It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
FUCK YOU. YOU GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
I'M NOT CRAZY. You're the one. You're the one who's wrong. You're the one --
Get out of here, get the fuck out of my house --
GET THE FUCK OUT.
FUCK YOU. FUCK YOU, YOU GET OUT.
Good morning. Did you know that? You're always singing?
I think that's called looting.
Yes.
I've never loved any one before, Gregory, and I do love you - you must know it -- but Jacqueline's my sister whom I had lost and have found again....
No, I'm glad....at least I've heard you say it...
I keep telling myself that.
Am I dead or not?
What? What's wrong?
What about it!
The polymerization probably synthesized into a kind of methyl- cyanoacrylate. So what's wrong?
It's nothing. Just a little catch ...
Did I tell you she threw the bottle- a milk at me?
I didn't go in your room.
Room service.
Nicolet and Dargus stop me at the airport and mark the bills.
Are you sure she don't know about the money?
It washes off. I tell them we're doing it the same way as before. They'll follow Sheronda. I hate the idea of leaving her for a fall.
What does she think she's gettin?
I'm not going to listen to this.
He loves you the way you are.
You didn't say 'Symington says'.
Oh, that's good, very professional. In control. But the tiny beads of sweat on your upper lip give you away.
No, you stay calm, Doctor! But you're finding that difficult, aren't you? Why, are you attracted to me? Perhaps later, in some of our more intimate sessions... after we know each other a little better... and you've torn my personality to shreds, and I'm weeping and vulnerable... then you'll really get your kicks, won't you, "Doctor?"
This whole thing is a joke!
I love you, Daddy --
What did you hear?
But what?
You were right about Joe, he is going somewhere --
Oh, God.
You should have tried harder.
What about Bill?
What about Bill?
You're Margo. Just - Margo.
And what is that? Besides something spelled out in light bulbs, I mean. Besides something called temperament, which consists mostly of swooping about on a broomstick creaming at the top of my voice... infants behave the way I do, you know. They carry on and misbehave - they'd get drunk if they knew how - when they can't have what they want. When they feel unwanted and insecure - or unloved.
We're never deeply angry, we just get sore. The way you do. We know you too well...
So many people - know me. I wish I did. I wish someone would tell be about me...
We've all seemed a little tense lately...
Come to think of it, I haven't been very pleasant for weeks. For that, I'm truly sorry. More than any two people I know, I don't want you and Lloyd to be angry with me...
He's in love with you.
More than anything in this world, I love Bill. And I want Bill. I want him to want me. But me. Not Margo Channing. And if I can't tell they apart - how can he?
I thought the subject was sex?
Have you ever seen animals make love, Mr. Dulaney? They have such passion -- such savage emotion. They struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. Not really.
Something like that.
A girl needs protection.
That's just my interpretation. Actually it's a dance designed as a sentiment of courtly manners. You see? Walk in a gently 'Z'. There are four distinct movements...
Yes. The old-fashioned way.
A strange little fellow, but you couldn't help liking him. He was close to ten but seemed more like a frightened five or six.
What do you mean?
That's right.
But I'm giving a party for him - a real, old-fashioned surprise party. Caps, bells, whistles, and everything. I'm really terribly excited about it. I've been planning it for months.
Well, what?
You? No can do. It's all set. Just a few of Tom's closest friends.
Don't be silly, Cyril. These are respectable people. They'd probably bore you to death.
I thought we were going to try for a baby. Isn't that enough of an adventure?
But why does he want to see me? He has never bothered about me.
Why?
... Okay...
We missed you in Church today, Frank.
Frances?
Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
A friend of mine offered me a job doing a little work installing a show in a gallery. He's an electrician. I was supposed to be there an hour ago.
Oh? Well, there's been some trouble on the ranch. I came up here to get out of the way. It's so dark now I doubt if I could find my way back down. If you could help...
But I don't know how to polka.
What was that?
Look at this -- "Lollipop Lolitas" - isn't child pornography totally illegal?
You won't be able to stay mad at me, right?
Yes.
It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
How did you?...
Yeah? And what else am I supposed to do? There's no baby anymore, and if she wants to throw away her life, that's her business.
All right, Mother.
No imposition. Plenty of food. Gonna get pretty dark soon. Hard to find a place.
Mrs. MacLean -- why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?
Oh uh, thank you. No, we don't want to impose.
Dickie?
What?
Tell me the truth. Did he kill Freddie?
I tried again, waiting here, watching for him. Instead it's you. Whenever I look for Dickie I find you. What happened to your face?
Ok. Ssh. Rest.
Where does Dickie live?
No.
Mother?
Let him out of here, Lieutenant.
Your hand's all wet and it's shaky. You're so funny.
Probably not.
He's not in this class.
He's not enrolled in this class.
...just some stuff. A little of this, a little of that, that's all.
I put her to sleep.
What did you do?
She... left me alone with that little thing, and I looked at it, and I thought this is a mistake. But it's my mistake, not Mommy's. God's mistake.
And then... what did she do? Agnes what did she do?
I tied the cord around her neck... wrapped her in the bloody sheets... and stuffed her in the trash can.
H... how?
What do you do? Tell her you love her.
I'm not your pupil. I was, but I'm not.
I can't take this anymore.
It seems your department doesn't believe out new unit is to the public benefit.
Why don't you just call him?
No, not that.
Why don't you just call him up?
I don't know.
I can't believe she's doing this -- taking advantage of him this way. It's cruel.
Thank Simone for the tickets.
I have to talk to her.
Obviously, this can't last. She's going to dump him. Viktor won't be able to take that. He's too sensitive. It'll destroy him.
Figured that out for yourself, did you?
I admit I may have seen better days, but I am still not to be had for the price of a cocktail - like a salted peanut.
Thea -- you're hiding something. Why do you suddenly speak of your father? You told me once you had never seen him -- didn't know him --
This is Annie MacLean.
I went on the Internet and found this article about you... It says you're a Horse Whisperer, that you... you help people with horse problems. And you have quite a success rate when it comes to traumatized --
Well, you know, however you want to put it -- I got your information from the publisher of the article. I called Montana and your sister-in-law, I think, gave me this number. I'm been hot on your trail you could say because I was hoping you'd consider coming to New York and taking a look at my daughter's horse and possibly --
I'll pay you for your fare. I'll send you to Montana first class.
Yeah, four years ago. They had me staying in this tiny-ass town with like fifty people. I'm not playing, there was about a thousand goats running around, and it gets dark at four o'clock. Then the whack club I'm on loses three games in a row and I get blamed. So they fire me.
Just like that?
Yup. So I've been playing with this Italian club the last three years.
Can you take that damn thing off the table.
You mean my championship trophy? My bad.
How's that been?
It's better. Even though the whole first season my teammates didn't pass to me cause they were mad "The American" was making more money. I led the team in rebounds cause it was the only way I could touch the damn ball.
What are you scared of?
And what about love?
Thank you. I bought it especially, Mrs. Rieper.
There's some good things on it, though.
The TV. There's some good things on it, sometimes.
You've done much of this work before?
The world of our children. How dare they?
You're American.
Lisa Martin Ramos, Mr. Creasy.
I hope so. At least I got to see you and Grandma. Has it ever worked before?
Would you like to stay for dinner? There aren't many choices in town and ... anyway, you'd have to eat alone. So would I.
But I... We don't even know each other.
Sometimes she can be quite careless. Why don't you try Mrs. Redi?
Difficult? Has anything happened to Jacqueline?
No, Mrs. Lowood, she doesn't write often.
Of course.
You are scum. I'll be there.
Okay, I will!!
With a face like this?
And you could care less --
Only to help the medics, I assure you.
Dr. Argon, I demand an explanation.
I mess around with this stuff, but I never thought anything would happen.
Does Norman know?
I think so
I'm sorry for leaving, but I mean, Jesus, Claire...
You know how to waltz??
He was a good man.
Why not?
Can I ask you something?
About your whore of a wife?
I could hide you, Tommy.
In case of what?
Be here. In case.
Fine. But what would I do at night?
They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
They good whitefolks?
In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything. Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
Carl, do you know? Like on a map...
I know we ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
I feel so close to you, so safe with you, Chauncey... ... And Benjamin understands that, dearest... He understands and accepts my feelings for you...
What then? Love? What would you kill for? For your wife, right?
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
Because they're your fave. And you can never have too much of your favorite one-calorie breath mint.
Well, of course. Your old D-A-D! You know I'll always be there to love and support you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.
I sort of already have.
I told him I was Mrs Sam Rothstein.
Yeah. That was me.
'We might as well make the best of it.'
I know. I don't always do exactly what I'm told. So I said, 'Do you enjoy watching me?' And you said -- come on Max.
Not to me! I wasn't fucking married to her!
What's going on, Moncho?
And was he in distress when you opened the door? Or was he sitting here, relaxed, at this table?
I told you. He let me go. I'm on my way home.
When... I m told he came here...
No. You'll want to ask a lot of questions I don't want to answer right now. I already have a ride.
Well, Leon does not need money for prints, Mr Lombard. Does his own printing. Wouldn t want anyone to interfere with his Art ! Which, as he subsequently vanished, raises the question: what was the money for? Perish the thought.
We are aware of your rates, Mr Lombard. We will pay you double your rates plus expenses. In return, need I say it again, we expect discretion and undivided attention.
Mr... I'm sorry, what was your name again?
Stop kidding. I want to know what happened.
What do you mean, flop sweat? -- you're making too much out of it...I'll bet you were the only one aware of it...
Aaron, will you tell me?
Then what was good about it?
Do others feel that you did well?
Please! Let me sit here. Let me stay here with you. I promise I won't say all word. I'll just be here, so you know no one's going to hurt you. Please, please!
Why not?
Give me one reason I can understand.
Where are you from originally?
the valley?
And what did your parents do?
Would you like to come in and see my house? Just for a minute.
And tomorrow maybe Troy will help you out--because I quit! This is ridiculous! You're ridiculous! I'm ridiculous!
... well, I just think she's got a lot of nerve showing up here. Draggin' that child and that poor animal all the way... You eat with those fingers again and you know what'll happen! Frank, don't you think she's got a nerve?
Look, I'll talk to Grace and call you later--
Isn't it like, obvious?
Vaughan, don't get pushy.
Yes.
That's the point. Besides, I know I can give something now that I wasn't remotely aware of before. It's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.
No.
It was the best time of his life.
Oh, but there is-
No Turks.
John, I know all about it.
No, John, you're too hard on yourself. I've got the creep here, the guy who's...
What's wrong?
I have a few more questions to ask her.
My God, but you're determined.
Where is she?
Hasn't she had enough?
This is permission to take her apart.
Tomorrow... tomorrow, I'll get it by tomorrow. I will.
Who knew she was pregnant?
Why do you insist upon pressing...
Get rid of Dodd for me.
Well you don't know that. Ask him.
It's for school, for summer writing class.
Have you ever been to the Apollo Cinema on Sansom Street?
Give it yourself.
Daddy, can I have thirty five dollars?
It makes us feel a whole lot better.
You said earlier you aspired to be the kind of person who had "an adventurous spirit." Is that correct?
Oh, shut up, Alex.
Maybe I don't want you to.
Look, I didn't come down here to fight.
You need me. Nobody knows the systems on this rig better than I do. What is something was to go wrong after the Explorer clears off? What would have you done?
Not particularly. Jeez, look where this is set! Morons.
That must be it.
Liverpool?
You don't, you can't believe that ...
Caesar, this is crazy.
You can't back out on me now. We need to be sure.
Look, John, I'm facing it.
I hope so.
Right here. Right here. Inside the magician. Shhhh.
Yes you did. Norman, I wouldn't leave you out there. You know that.
... Lover's Lane.
He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
Straightest answer your department's given me all week.
How's it going?
Green committed to a thousand. There's another fund-raising party tonight. Marty'd really like you to come.
What a great kite.
Good.
Rejected, worthless, miserable.
What happened with Rick?
Victor, please, don't go to the underground meeting tonight.
Don't joke. After Major Strasser's warning tonight, I am frightened.
Whatever I'd say, you'd carry on. Victor, why don't you tell me about Rick? What did you find out?
Yes?
I have a bad feeling about this.
You're all scumbags.
Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
I also put side two of London Calling on there...
That's boring!
I'm busy tomorrow anyway. I have to buy six thousand paper napkins.
She never proved anything, not a thing!
Yea.
That's not true!
No...
That's what I thought until you came riding in. I saw your car over at the gas station. It's cool. Want to take me for a ride? Desert's kind of lonely this time of day.
You did? How is he?
Dinner's in the oven.
Think back about what she said. Exactly what she said.
Something in your car...
I'd better get back now.
Just checking up on your family. I guess I was drunker than I thought and the idea of going back to my hotel in a wet dress... Well...
Did he mention it?
Are mom and dad here?
Depend on it. No s. Your subject is plural.
They hid my car--
What's the best fortune you ever got?
In Kowloon, once, I got one that said, "Live now because life is dust."
I forgot the napkins.
Why?
Pretty serious.
I gotta tell ya...
...I-I... made some mistakes and I spent some money.
Darrell? You know he and Jake are...
Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere...
Yes, it's on the stove...
...if you are, then I'll take Barbara to soccer and take you to dance after...
Don't you have to be at the office?
You figure!
A what?
Is he coming home?
The park!
How nice.
Shutup! -- but then I figured out you were a swell guy, a little slow maybe, but a swell guy! Well, maybe you're not so slow, but you're not so swell either and it looks like you're an imbecile after --
First Bank ? But how ?
Shutup! -- after all! You haven't talked to me for a week and now I'm going to say my piece. I've got a prediction for you, Norville Barnes: I predict that since you've decided to dedicate yourself to greed and sloth and everything bad, you're going to lose all the good things that your good ideas brought you. You're going to throw them all away chasing after money and ease and the respect of a Board that wouldn't give you the time of day if you... if you...
What do we do? What do you want to do?!
I don't know! Shit! Let's just play it by ear. He may not know. He may just give me a ticket.
Please, God, please don't let us get caught. Please, please, please...
Hello, Officer. Is there a problem?
Oh yeah.
I told you to slow down. Hell, Officer, I told her to slow down.
I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well.
And glow happily ever after.
No, this is Jack. Jango was hit by a UPS truck. Can you believe it?
I didn't want to. It just happened. One day Gary was there. He took care of everything. He took care of me. I was a mess.
Her name's Hannah.
Why?
Just what do you think you're doing?!
HUH?!
Noooo....
Forged papers! Now, what?!
So what are we gonna do about this?
Yes?
What do you mean?
I told you! I told you! You're going to pay for my banner!
Please do not talk like this.
Dickie? Do you know Dickie?
You were at the Opera? Well, that explains -- yes I was there. I was there with Dickie.
I told you! I knew it!
Marge, I don't know you, so I have no right, but Dickie loves you. He's -- I think you'll find he's coming home to you.
How would you know that?
Oh, Elliot!
That's wonderful. I think you should... fresh air.
Oh, what, in this section of town?
If only you'd remained true to our contract! Opiates, for his nerves! Restraints! The man warrants a bed of nails --
The scale... it's just... So all the civilizations you detect; they all end up coming here?
So who...?
And they all travel here through this wormhole subway system you built.
And those other docking ports I saw... I mean... there are others?
And you? Why did you lie? You promised I could be confessed...
But where has it gone? Where's all the strength and the quickness?
No... I told you on the phone. Whoever broke in messed-up all your papers. I put everything back where I thought it ought to be. Maybe it s there with...
Hello there. How s the flat. I cleaned...
Mike, there's something that's been on my mind and I have to tell you about it.
I came to feed your fish. I didn t know...
You didn't tell me that they can be so nice, so great... but then you sleep with them and they start acting like they're five years old.
Well, I m sorry. I... This is my nephew... And my brother, Tim. I ve got the week off and he s come to stay.
You're right. I didn't tell you that.
He's with his dying mother!
No more he's not.
We wish to commune with the spirit of Mrs. Feur. What's her first name?
Patrick, I think he knows you're here. It's only ten-thirty.
Patrick, a Mr. Donald KIMBALL is here to see you.
Detective Donald KIMBALL?
Yes.
I fantasized about you.
Yes.
I know. Deep down, I know that. It just bothers me, when I have feelings or impulses that she has.
Have you fantasized about me?
You're beginning to sound like Mr. Kirkeby already.
It's supposed to be Don Knotts.
And what was your reason for choosing him as your subject?
Get away from me!
Who is this, Enid?
What do we have here, Margaret?
I dunno... I just like Don Knotts.
I see... interesting...
Oh, Sandro... I'm so ashamed of myself, so ashamed...I tried to hide myself...I feel so small... I hate myself ...
I can see that... now what can you tell us about it? First of all, what kind of sculpture is this?
Don't think that I want to save myself from any embarrassment, from the awkwardness of meeting Anna... It's not that; it's that you can say certain things easier if you're alone. Please, Sandro, do try to understand me... It would look like I was trying to influence you, to force you, to control you... and that makes me feel uncomfortable...
Sandro ... maybe it's best that you go in alone.
Where you headed?
Stephen's not staying here now, Brian. He moved out last April.
You guys ought to try picking up a phone once in awhile.
Yeah, I've had it forever. I used to have this thing with marking the words that I looked up.
James.
Okay.
Melvin, even though it may seem that way now -- you don't know me all that well... I'm not the answer for you.
You know what? I...
No! It's certainly not. No -- I don't think so. No.
...fourteen years...
What happened?
Why didn't they say that before you started?
You mean they let you go through the officer training course and then said you were too old for a commission?
You taste it.
That's not the point.
What are you going to be then?
That's right. And I'll see you in the morning in the lobby. Do you mind waiting outside for the taxi?
My pleasure.
Really? Okay!
Neat. Goodnight!
Why are you here? Why didn't you die?
That's right! And I'm sure you'll help me.
Give it back to me.
Oh, it's a story. A story I'm making up.
Give it to me.
You told Charlie to lay down and die. Will you say that to me too? What happens, Eddie?
Jake...
Jake, this is your father's bedroom.
I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band.
Well, they seem just like everyone else.
Hi, Bob.
No, no! I haven't heard any of this. I never got those telephone calls. I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here.
Wait. Something's not right. Isn't that your jacket?
Are you okay?
It's just... you've been acting kinda strange, you know?
I don't know. You seem... different. You make weird jokes. Your accents changed. You don't even walk the same.
I can't put my finger on it, but everything's a bit off. Even the dinner tonight. It was beautiful, but...
Now, children, no fighting -- save that for the office. Let's have our dance.
Do you gentlemen know each other, Mr. Kringelein -- Mr. Preysing -- Baron von Gaigern.
Tomorrow morning.
We decided...
You just might.
You're shouting at me.
You're upset about me -- I made you fight --I hate for you to fight.
Yah, not too bad. So it's nice up there?
Quiet today?
Molly, of all the people... if I can't trust my resident assistant, then what?
Okay, tell you what... you can still be the school R.A., but no dance tomorrow night.
Stop it.
He didn't give you much choice.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
God! I've never seen anything like that in my whole life! Did you see that guy's nose?
Well, excuse me for livin'!
Opening up just a little wouldn't kill you, ya know.
We've got to call the police.
What is with you tonight?
I guess so.
Two detectives are coming out.
Just like to make sure. That your past. And my future. Are real different.
No. We decided that we're friends. I mean, I know it's a terrible word...
The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
Thank you.
Inside? Why should I give house- room to your sort?
That's what he said the last time. Don't believe him, Judge.
Wait. There's a half a bottle a soothin' sirup here. It put the chillun to sleep.
Ray wants him.
What's the matter?
How'd you find out?
How does Winston find him if A.T.F. and all the local Police can't?
He's liable to shoot you.
I couldn't have done it without you, Charles.
Oh, me, I'm okay.
Do you miss Frederick?
No.
Yeah. I'm here.
Don't say that. You know it's not true.
Thank you very much.
That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
Maybe I should come back another time.
Okay...
Like what... my favorite color... ?
Originally, Connecticut.
God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever...
You okay?
Yeah.
Waiter!
Have we been talking too long? Must we change the subject?
Ya say we're acrost?
Your mother thought he was a good man. He worked very hard. What I remember most was his manner was so... slight. It was easy to spend time in a room, and not realize he'd been there the whole time.
Worried about me! Well, you just stop it!
Probably.
So make your domestic decisions and maybe we'll talk again.
I had you pegged, didn't I?
Joel, I'm not a concept. I want you to just keep that in your head. Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them or I'm going to make them alive, but I'm just a fucked-up girl who is looking for my own peace of mind. Don't assign me yours.
The infamous dog?
Yes.
Oh...
Thank God! An' we're still together-- most of us.
Yeah, I know what you mean. It's a long drive up here. Where're you staying?
That's the original. There are no copies.
I'm not a loser.
My pocketbook.
Help yourself.
Beauty products.
Yeah. He's just a friend of mine I was trying to help, so... so what?
So you fucked a student?!
Well, where is it? I-
Okay.
Okay, that's good.
Yeah... so, listen-you drive?
Oh, you do?
A cop? You want me to trust a cop?!
What did you think I would do? Jesus Christ! I gave up my life and my music...
From you, Norman. From your mind. You're doing it.
...Oh BULLSHIT. You had to topple perfect Daddy and that meant perfect wife, perfect family...
You may not believe this Bud but I really do care for you. I think we could've made a good team...but that's how it goes...
Ted, all my life I'd either been somebody's daughter or somebody's wife, or somebody else's mother. Then all of a sudden, I was a thirty-two-year-old, highly neurotic woman who had just walked out on her husband and child. I went to California because that was about as far away as I could get. Only... I guess it wasn't far enough. So I started going to a shrink. Ted, I've had time to think. I've been through some changes. I've learned a lot about myself.
Ted, listen to me...You and I, we had a really crappy marriage-- Look, don't get so defensive, okay? It was probably as much my fault as it was yours... Anyway when I left I was really screwed up--
I want my son. I'm through sitting in coffee shops looking at him from across the street. I want my son.
Ted...The reason I wanted to see you...I want Billy back.
Will? Are you awake?
Since this morning.
Come on, say it. You know...
I want to watch.
Of course you can.
Norbert--you come, too. Let him go, Harold. Let him go.
You've killed women?
Do it, Norbert.
Hello, Sophie.
Sophie, this is Chauncey Gardiner...
Chauncey, this is Mrs. Sophia Rowley.
Was he a good detective?
Like you?
Yes, I know.
No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
Oh, I'm fine.
How long have you been with him?
Almost five years.
How did you meet him?
He's a launderer?
Basically.
Caesar's Mafia, isn't he?
You have to ask?
No.
Funny, nobody calls it that anymore. Caesar calls it "The Business."
Josh? He's nobody's boyfriend... He's just this guy that Becky and I like to torture.
I wish I could be like my momma though. She always knew what was wrong. Knew just what to say.
Six years.
PLEASE? We have to!
At least it gives you plenty of exercise.
I don't know. It's not... seasoned yet. Wait. Huh. Yeah, there's that pink plus sign again. God, it's unholy.
Umm, where do you want this?
Grady.
It seems one of our students is -- missing and his parents found a dead dog in his bed.
Shh.
You are an animal.
I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men.
What is wrong, my darling?
I can't answer that for you -- but it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is now. You tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father. Come on, tell me...
Well, you know him, he's a friend of yours, do you think he can be trusted?
No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- Why? Is there something I should have heard about you?
How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me.
Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford.
It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship.
The song I was trying to hum. The song my friend, taught me.
What song, dear?
Mommy --
Oh, you'll remember it some time.
I wasn't saying anything. I was singing.
What are saying, darling?
Did you ever make a wish?
Yes, darling.
You gotta low-life job, mister sheriff!
Could you do anything about it?
What's wrong?
What about it?
is bending down, pulling a tray of sausage rolls into the oven. Both girls look at HONORA silently.
Good mornin', Nathan.
It isn't fair...
I know, I got your message. Ray wanted to have dinner. He wanted to talk about the sting we're plotting. That's what he calls it. A sting. He's being real nice to me.
Right around here, in the food court.
Yeah, we were goin' over everything. That's why all the bags.
I'm helping him bring his money into America. He loves the idea. You just missed him.
Yes.
Huh.
What do you want?
All right. Give me this. I need it for a moustache. Now close your eyes.
What's the trick here ?
You know better than to interrupt me.
Little chilly.
I can thank you for that. It was a hard-earned talent.
Bread?
Yes.
When's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, Ernest Farmer?
Of course, dear. You're home now.
Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home.
Mom!
I have a note.
The nurse called and said you'd be coming home.
I'm excused.
How do you feel?
Mom!
Why don't you go lie down for a while.
Obviously, but what's the way out ?
You know how I feel about Texas... We're not going that way.
Wait. What? You want to go to Mexico from Oklahoma and you don't want to go through Texas?
I'm sorry. I'm just not in the mood for company right now. Here. Take this map. I need you to find all the secondary roads to Mexico from Oklahoma City. I think we should stay off the interstates. We're too conspicuous.
I just don't see what it would hurt just to give somebody a ride. Did you see his butt? Darryl doesn't have a cute butt. You could park a car in the shadow of his ass.
I don't want to go that way. Find a way that we don't have to go through Texas.
Well, it looks like we can get on this road 81 that heads down towards Dallas, then cut over to...
What did Darryl say?
I wish we could've brought him with us.
He said "Okay, Thelma. I just wanted to know you were alright. I hope you're havin' a good time. You sure deserve one after puttin' up with me all the time. I love you, honey."
How long till the room fills ?
No, Mrs. Pilletti. We were just going home. Thank you very much anyway.
Siddown, siddown. You want some chicken? We got some chicken in the ice box.
You're trying to get me to say something, that's why you're telling me all of this.
All right.
Nothing.
Hello, Marty, when you come home?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Tea.
No, lover. I'll see what you can do.
Jerry told me you were an expert with animals, Mr. Galbraith. Couldn't you tell where it went?
In the flack jacket. Still like getting hit in the back with a baseball bat. Took the air right out of me, but I was just unconscious for awhile. 'Course, you didn't stick around to find that out. You left me for dead.
You just got back from a four game road trip.
He's not saying that! He's saying don't volunteer!
That's right!
No! I don't want you to go to the police! There were other people and why should you be the only one involved!
Before the actual accident?
I was scared.
It was snowing.
Did you think I could just leave you...?
You should come and have lunch with us, before you go -- Dickie?
How do you do.
I don't need one.
No! No! Please!
Can't remember the last time I saw you in that suit.
Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
What do you do now?
Tom?
Scoundrels? They weren't scoundrels, they were just boys.
Au contraire, mon cher.
To the stars.
Well, you're pretty close. It's only about two miles from here.
I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it.
He was a crooked bastard. He would have killed us.
The mattress... The mattress... JULIA.
It's only four days.
Did you buy that gun?
...Where'd you get the pistol?
That'll be the day.
What's in the satchel?
I can't.
And Benjamin sends along his best wishes.
He's tired, Chauncey - but he's going to watch you tonight. We'll both be watching.
Chauncey...
Chauncey, I just wanted to wish you well. I know you'll be smashing.
I know you do - you and your television... ... Good luck, Chauncey.
...Screw you.
Please don't go.
Sebastian, please. I don't want us to end on bad terms.
How am I a hypocrite?
Why don't you start with me?
You want to kill them.
You hunt us like animals -- do you know how many you have slaughtered?!
You are The Human. The Hunter. The thing that comes in the day and kills --
What do you want?
And the money?
Forget it.
Oh, good.
David?
Jude, you okay?
Lydia?! Lydia who!?
Can I have my desk please.
Yes, Senator-- twice .
It's the same image - Kong!
Is it good?
Was the show covered by every department?
We've got a nice plant here.
And the notice?
Uh huh, I wanna be a writer.
Okay.
What is it all about?
Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! I loved my doggie very much, monsieur.
Oui. Perfect!
Oui, doctor, oui.
Oui.
Did you write that column?
How do you know him?
God, aren't you tired of Seymour yet?
As opposed to twenty angry women?
Looks like this is goodbye.
Deal.
Hey, you have to see my new good luck charm.
No kidding. I looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.
How about this one?
Shhhhh!
Actually, no, I've changed my mind. I shouldn't have called.
That's right. But I never took a vow in front of God and everybody to be "faithful" to my sister.
Gabriel, what are you doing!
Still champions.
No...
What did you do that for?
What are you doing? What's wrong? I told you we've got a 4:30.
It's a good thing your hand did not become infected -- how did you cut it like this?
I'll come by tomorrow after work. With dinner.
Okay.
I think I'm going crazy, Tom. I really do. Are you happily married?
I was running around like a chicken with my head chopped off. Doing my imitation of you.
You are lying, you never lost that kid for 4 seconds, you could find him from a coma, there is no WAY!
Ben never mentioned it.
Sometimes we're forced to make hard decisions. I'd like for us to stay together, Craig. You know, platonically, if that's possible. I truly value our friendship.
You're late.
I've fallen in love.
That's the guy I lived with... his name was... Hirosh.
About five years ago.
I lived there for about nine months.
That's a picture of me in Japan.
Maybe that's jus' what he done.
Maybe they'll be other movies.
I'm married.
Thanks, Harry, really, but... I can't explain it. She's my mother. She's just... I can't give up on her that easy.
You just have to remember... men are like houses and trade upwards... I thought you had a pretty good marriage.
We did for a long time. We just got married too young, and ended up blaming each other for missing out on things.
You should stickaround sometimes. Look out for me.
What's that?
Rose, you're very sick. You're burning up. Rose, can you hear me? Rose?
What? Wha-at? Mrs. Hillyer?
She looks terrible, just awful.
She hid it from us, Doctor. She's afraid of the hospital.
He needs to be turned over.
I realize that...
You see, like you and I...
Well, what does-what does that mean? I don't know what that is.
No, I'm not.
Well. You're not the first guy I wrote to. But you're the only one I kept writing to.
Go to hell, Nick Mason, what's that supposed to mean --
No --
You think Tran killed her?
So finally he gives Iris some cash and tells her to check into the hotel under a wrong name till he figures out what to do.
Why didn't he just go public with the tape? Save himself that way.
I was thinking of something kinda stupid last night. You know those women in the greek mythology that made love with the Gods. Take Leda for example, sleeping with Jupiter, who came to earth as a swan... Well, can you imagine Leda announcing to her swan "You're going to be a father, my little chick-a-dee"?
I mean it, let's get away from here, first Joey then Nolan, now Charley and any minute... . ...I'm frightened I'm frightened.
Are you married, Mr. -- ?
Someone you have to get back to?
That's right, Homer. This ain't your business.
I'm gonna call him.
Never say never you always say that. I'll bet daddy's mad at me now.
Thanks Coco. It'd be so embarrassing
No, no. I'm on my way to my audition. Before I go I wanted to ask you if you could remember the man's name ... Aunt Ruthie's friend who helped put this together. It completely went out of my mind.
ARE YOU CRAZY, YOU COULD SUFFOCATE IN THERE!!!
It's left its mark still. The last thing these children need to do, is worry about some crazy things happening in the world. Take them into town. Get their minds -- your mind, on everyday things. It's good medicine.
You take care of yourself... Graham.
Go on. We'll be fine. I'll feed Jango to the frogs.
Chuck, you're breaking my heart.
I'm perfectly calm, George, I'm simply saying you have no respect for me, that you're incapable of distinguishing between me and one of your average Hollywood... mummers...
I don't want to talk about it...
I don't care.
Get a room in a nice hotel for a few hours...
Has he?
He's irresponsible.
He used to date Pat Benatar!
Good luck, David.
They requested her. It was her gig. Max put me on as a favor.
Oh my god. What happened?
Bobby, this is a plumb gig. It's a bunch of young agents and it's at a restaurant. It's gonna be easy and we'll make a lot of money.
Easy night. Bachelor party. Can we give Wendy a ride?
The easy kind. They're young and rich and well mannered.
This one is gorgeous.
Not for long. Not when they do a fingerprint check.
Oh, yeah? Is the frame holding?
I've really got to --
Somewhere else, that's for sure.
-- Viktor, are you with her? Is she there?
What if he sees you?
Don't be silly, Caesar. It'll take five minutes.
If one night I didn't come to the tent, what would you do?
Don't worry, I'll get some more.
I'm sorry. It was an accident.
I knew it.
You first.
Ringing my bell...
Truck. Of course.
Truck.
Oh yes they do. Look. One is like a tall princess.
David --
I'll just never learn arithmetic.
Can't you get it, darling?
The numbers simply don't mean anything
But you must!
Oh, I like the sound of that.., Amy and her friend... Amy and her friend.
No one leaves a star. That makes one a star.
No. This must be a friendship that only we shall have... you and I... Amy and her friend.
Whenever you want.
You'll always play with me?
Jesus. They look like the Secret Service.
Don't.
Take dictation - Front page editorial - "This afternoon a great man was assassinated. He was the President of the United States -"
What are you doing?
I'm much obliged, Mr. President, for your concern about me. However, I happen to be concerned at this moment with the matter of extensive oil lands belonging to the people of the United States, and I say that if this lease goes through, the property of the people of the United States goes into the hands of -
Don't. Take me with you.
Brody...I don't know... ...Something Brody!
Yeah, I heard that one before.
What?
It sure could, yeah. Thanks a lot.
No thanks... .
A dive? You mean, into the water?
Now what are you doing?
What?
Michael, you and I are light years apart. You should go, but not with me.
... I just don't know right now! Do whatever you can and when Grace is --
I hate chickens.
Liz, listen, the Doctor's here and I just can't, uh... talk now... so --
- See, what you can do for him --...
That's a terrific line. You're going to be a wonderful writer.
I don't want a steak.
Later we found out she was deaf and we hadn't even known it.
I keep thinking of that day, Tuesday the 26th, the day after they buried Kennedy, L.B.J. was signing the memorandum on Vietnam with Ambassador Lodge.
Those are cold.
You don't have to.
Yup. That's me.
You want a drink?
This is pretty good. Considering...
What's this?
No, it's fine. Thanks.
I hate boats.
Really? Fingernails?
Enzo!
What's wrong?
I haven't seen Clay or Eric lately.
To see your father?
Well! What do you want me to do - applaud?
Where is it? He. The boy you said my brother bought! Where is he?
In English, Enrique. We're in the United States--
You have somebody else out there?
Don't tell me lies, Enrique. Que paso?
Daniel give me that beanshooter!
Mm-hm. I'm a big girl. I can take care of myself. If I didn't want to be here, I'd be in a limo right now with a bunch of kids looking for Chinese food.
Why don't you just try? Please. For me. Come on.
Well, that's what parenting is about, little girl. They are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. And you sure as hell showed her.
And there will come another moment. When the stakes are really there. And she will look back on this. And remember how good it felt. How easy it was.
Of course. I'll get a car to drive you.
You've turned her into you. And I may not get another chance. To turn her back.
For not believing you.
I would also like to apologize.
I would not have thought it. There is something better than a play.
Answer me only this: are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?
You sure about that?
I do not know how to undress a man.
Guy Perkins and his amazing Lemmings. They push your car out of its space, hide it, then watch while you look for it. We've taken to chaining ours together for safety. I'm Aldys.
... couldn't take painkillers cause they made me too groggy to take care of my kids.
They took some bone from my hip and put it in my neck. I didn't have insurance, so I'm about seventeen thousand in debt right now.
When it's not yours. My mom was going through her Harlequin Romance phase.
These are transcripts of various radio broadcasts, including Gaitskill's, the one they tried to stop. You ought to have that ...
I'm Josie. Aldys is an interesting name.
guess. Although, what is truly awful is that with the combined intellectual effort of every kid in that room right now-
You don't aim to kill nobody, Tom!
I've got something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?
You want me to be a doll forever?
You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
Who? Who made you promise? It's alright Agnes. It's alright. Let's go to your room. It's the night about six weeks ago when you were very sick.
I'm afraid.
Did anyone else know about the baby?
I can't tell you that.
Will she be angry?
She made me promise not to.
What made it grow? Do you know?
Yes.
Would you like to tell me?
No.
Like if I meet a handsome young man and I wanted to ask him to dance? I can do that?
I know it pains.
It pains that they should do this.
Oh, Catherine, please! Don't make a tragedy. You come to my house where you know you be happier yourself.
Catherine, my sister...
These are the worst years. I tell you. It's gonna happen to you. I'm afraida look inna mirror. I'm afraid I'm gonna see an old lady with white hair, like the old ladies inna park, little bundles inna black shawl, waiting for the coffin. I'm fifty- six years old. What am I to do with myself? I have strength in my hands. I wanna cook. I wanna clean. I wanna make dinner for my children. Am I an old dog to lie in fronta the fire til my eyes close? These are the terrible years, Theresa! Terrible years!
Catherine, you are very dear to me. We have cried many times together. When my husband died, I would have gone insane if it were not for you. I ask you to come to my house, because I can make you happy. Please come to my house.
What else?
To do what?
Anything?
But where are you going to be?
What about you?
What do you mean "on his way up"!?
Don't bother!
Don't bother.
What?
No. Did he really?
I feel terrible about what happened. What did he say?
That your desk? I'll take this one.
Funny, the C.O. says I can.
Anybody usin' these drawers here?
Your new roommate.
No. I just thought... forget it.
Why? There's no food in the house?
Honey, come on. Would you like to stay in town for dinner? Maybe see what movie's playing tonight?
If I had everything I need, I wouldn't be going to physical therapy.
You got everything you need?
It's not up to you to save me, Jack.
Don't you?
Ancient. Have you finished your homework?
After this dance.
You know it? It must be an old one.
I'm not afraid you, Creasy.
We'll go to church and get you baptized, tomorrow's Sunday. You go on back to bed.
Where's my mother?
It's no wonder you're late. Why didn't she just come with you?
You're late.
You were never late before, I was worried.
How can I be together if I'm not together?
You were supposed to show up. Maybe I wasn't.
Molested little girls?
So, what did you do?
The worst?
I'll take it. What's the matter, Mr. Burns -- don't you understand English? -- Why, your language is shocking, Mr. Burns -- positively shocking! I don't mind because I was married to you and know what to expect, but suppose Central is listening in... Oh, did you hear that, Central? We ought to report him, don't you think?... Oh, fooey on you!
Your heart.
I guess.
Oh, get off that trapeze! There's your story! Smear it all over the front page -- Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post! And take all the credit -- I covered your story for you and I got myself in a fine mess doing it -- and now I'm getting out! I know I told you that twice before today -- but this time I mean it!
Let go o' me! I've got to get Bruce out of jail! Oh, Walter, why did you have to do this to me?
Wait a minute -- wasn't it Stanley who discovered Livingstone?
I know, but --
I'd like to think.
Good.
And do what... rot away in a room? We're not going to talk about that. Fuck you! I will not talk about that. You're staying here. You are not moving to a hotel.
I don't know what to say about it, Walter. It was a form of temporary insanity. But I had to tell you about it because --
No. Look, forget it. I don't want to talk about it.
I don't know what I saw. Okay? Coffey wants to call it a Russian submersible, fine. It's a Russian submersible. No problem.
What?
I can't eat before a game.
Taste this.
One more minute.
Come on, guys. It's five o'clock.
Yes, yes, I did.
Is this how you're going to make me pay my phone bill?
I was told ten thousand in each pack.
We could, if I'm not in jail.
I don't understan' it, Tom.
How?
Sit down here.
Don't tell me, you're a workaholic.
You mean Shelly?
What about that guy this morning?
We make our own choices and we pay our own prices. I think we're more alike than you want to admit.
I think so, too.
Fuck it! I think you better leave.
I suppose he just wants to watch.
No. Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.
Yeah.
Stop it.
...Ray?
Eat your dinner.
Are you from Washington originally?
Oh. When did you move back?
...you wearing a watch, Father?
It's great of you to let William and Susan stay at the house until he gets on his feet.
Frustrating. Form over content. Everything's so retro.
Peter, are you okay?
No.
That's really nice!
I don't go there. Too many party girls.
Yeah, if you have any dimes left. 477- 0496.
You do! You definitely do.
I don't thinkI can.
Its cramped in here isn't it BRIAN
Tell me BRIAN, what would happen if the client lost the key?
Thanks again. For the dinner.
Would you? Really? Wow. I could have deejay Rob Gordon play in my own home.
Uh huh?
If you had an American Express card she'd give you a blowjob. Listen, this girl worked in a tanning salon, need I say more?...What do you do?
It's all bullshit. Jesus is out of communication in Fals de Iguazu. Jos knows that... Whatever he's going to do, he has to do it fast because he's acting on his own. And he will need a story.
They will kill you. And then they will kill your wife, too.
Maybe. Maybe with the crazy whites.
Wrong number.
You look tired.
I'm getting married.
I thought you'd be at the dinner.
I mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until I die?
Not now, David, it's time for bed. You have a long trip ahead of you in the morning...
You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence, in class today. I believed his story, but I was afraid the other children wouldn't...
I can get home all right from here
You could? How?
I'm not... Bobby I'm gonna need some more stuff. I mean it. I'm out.
What is the world coming to when you kill a guy for baby laxative?
Oh, is that so?
I'm all right.
TV repair?
Yeah ...
Some judge...
David, stop stressing, you can like-- turn it on normally ...
Should we take the quotes off experiment and call it what it is?
Yes, sir.
Why? What the big deal?
His mother's dead, and he hasn't seen his father in twelve years.
Uh, thanks.
My dad went through this phase where he was obsessed with Greek and Roman mythology. He named me after Zeus's wife. I mean, Zeus had other lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife. She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.
I weighed my options. But after all this, I'm glad I didn't, you know, get rid of it. I want to have it. For you guys.
It's not that simple. It costs money to do this at home.
No. Maybe I believe God has a bigger dream for me than I had for myself. Maybe I believe the journey, the big adventure, never ends...
It's the only way.
My son.
After that, who cares?
Did you get it?
I feel like a bootlegger's wife. Look!
And if I don't?
It is broad day! The rooster tells us so!
Mr. Henslowe?
Killed?
Mr. Duke? Hello, Mr. Duke, I'm sorry we were cut off a moment ago... I thought I should call again, because I was wondering...
Ah, yes. Mr. Duke? You have one message: "Call Lucy at the Americana Hotel, room 1600."
Yes you were.
How unhappy he's going to be--alone in his room.
I want you to tell me that you loved me once.
Just one favor.
I see.
You know, I like that suit, Bobo. I don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.
Oh, well, you know. I just clip a buck here and a buck there. Not enough to notice.
Or else he's working an angle. If he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.
A person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. He's a liability, right, Bobo?
Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff.
Begin what?
I'd like to begin.
Listen to her singing.
Do you think Agnes is still attached to God?
May I be present?
Would it stop you if I did?
The hypnotism. Do you still disapprove?
Then let's begin.
Of course.
Oh dear.
And you think he'll...
I think I'll stand out here in the sun.
Perhaps I did... Until fear turned into panic. That s when he hit me, and told me he d killed my brother... You don t know what you ve done, he said. We re in deep trouble, he said. We, he said. We. We d both be killed if Friedman ever found out you were working for us, he said. We had to stop you and Friedman meeting...
Ha... No, Mr Lombard. His monthly allowance is all he is to expect from us. He knows it and we feel the amount is more than adequate.
My husband and I will be leaving tomorrow for a short stay in Israel. Deborah will be here if you need anything before our return.
I have too much money to work, Mr Lombard.
Perhaps it wasn t so brave of him. Had I been here I just might have given him his money, Mr Lombard. One can reap rewards from the strangest of conduct, as someone in your line of work ought to know.
Nothing...
Are you sure it isn't contagious?
Just a few more minutes, then we can go. Take her, will you?
She lived on the plume. You never know.
Fine -- maybe I'll see you there sometime.
Maybe it isn't going to Sonora, but it's going somewhere, which is all right with me.
No, Bruce, dear. Don't you see? This is a trick to get your sympathy. No, Walter, I've been waiting for something like this -- but I wasn't sure when you'd spring it. If you want to save Earl Williams' life, you can interview him yourself. You're still a good reporter. Bruce and I will be on that four o'clock train -- and thanks just the same.
Why, Walter, you're getting poetic!
What a performance! Bravo! Don't let him fool you, Bruce -- it's only an act!
Hi... am I late?
Well let's do something do you want to do something, can you meet me?
No. What do you mean? BARRY I just wanted to know. When was the last time you had a boyfriend?
HI. WHERE ARE YOU? ARE YOU HERE?
OH WOW. YEAH. THAT'S GREAT. YOU CAME, YOU CAME. What are you doing?
About six months ago. Why?
Yeah... Well...
No.
Thank you very much. Aren't you a gentleman? Mr. ...
Hello.
I have only one thing now. Are you interested?
It's not your fault.
I did a lot of singing after that. I sang for Charlie - I sang for teachers at a hundred bucks an hour - the teachers got that, I didn't -
Then you have no alibi at all. Please sing.
Oh, no, that's all gone.
Don't tell me your toothache is bothering you again?
Well, I -
All right.
Oh, you wouldn't want to hear me sing.
Would you sing for me?
As a matter of fact, I do sing a little.
Yes -
...I know you don't want to be an accessory to something like that.
Now, I saw some rough stuff on your priors, but nothing in the nature of a homicide...
I don't love him. I love Ronald.
So? Don't you want to make Ronald a happy pappy? Practice makes perfect, Cecile. My advice is to sleep with as many people as possible.
So you think you might remember who those folks were who called ya?
Mr. Lundegaard?
What do I do then?
Well did you like it?
Knox. Oh yes, Knox. I'm glad you called.
This is my Uncle Roy, Sebastian.
What is it?
Wow. Got here just in time. I brought you this.
Why does everyone find that so surprising?
Okay, I'm a little tender.
Cause...your...only daughter just went away to school...who you were incredibly close with aaand I'd be tripping...
So, we each have three -- that's six. What about the seventh day? I want ascending bowel cancer.
Jody--
I'll be right back.
Sure --
Okay, thank you for asking.
Truman, I took the "hypocrite" oath!
Sorry. Uh, let me see, have a seat. I'll get you some aloe vera for that cut too.
Jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?
Who's that?
How many drinks have you had?
Six Martinis. You're not going to have anything on me.
What hit me?
The poem is really about attitude. It's about not giving up and...it's easy to be overwhelmed sometimes but...that's when we should...force ourselves to push on.
You're right. I must've made a mistake.
No, I can't let you. I can't, you're
Terry, for God's sake.
Terry, you're bleeding.
We're all going to have to go out for breakfast. The cook quit yesterday.
John! Can you hear me? Are you still there?
But you can't just kill a man for his teeth!
Stop it! What are you doing?
That's different... I mean... we were fighting for a... for a cause!
Because... because you just can't!
Me, too.
Huh.
Should I?
It must've been a time. A golden moment.
I like the colors.
You haven't done one goddam thing to make any of this easier...
I am not here to make it easier for you. These are my children. They don't want to be with you.
Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
A court order is gonna say that woman is never alone with my children! Ever again! Do you HEAR that?
Guinevere, Godiva, I sense enemy sol...
Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values.
I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen...
Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation.
No. The little one.
Your kid dropped it off.
Maybe you left 'em in the bathroom.
Did you look around the headboard?
They're weird names.
Well -- I could meet you at the theatre -- if that's all right.
Let me see it...
Nobody but you can do that to me. I don't know why.
Look, everything's going your way.
Look at me George. That meeting's not for me. Look at my face.
I don't want to put on some make up ...
I don't want it to go away.
No I'm not sweetie.
I made a couple of lunches for you and put them in brown paper bags ... I'm gonna go now.
Let me be the judge of that.
Oh, Graham. No, I didn't talk to him about that. Actually, that turned out to be pretty interesting. I expected Graham to be this... well, like John, you know? I mean, he said they had gone to school together, so I was expecting lots of stories about getting drunk and secret handshakes and stuff. But he turned out to be this... this kind of character, I mean, he's kind of arty but okay, you know?
That sounds like you is in trouble already, Homer.
Yes, it's this radioactive gas in the ground, and houses kind of act like magnets to pull it up, and -- you've never heard of this?
What visitor?
He works on the movie.
Okay. The woman just can t walk away... I want straight answers. No hesitation or I walk for sure. Why can t you go to your Embassy?
You don t know why he s come to Los Angeles? The man you say he killed? Who was he? A colleague of his?
This is a pretty dead bunch, isn't it?
How can you bring that up at a time like this?
What's their name?
I'll say. This is solid gold.
And she was saying how happy you were to finally have them over. Because you're both, so, what - introspective? And you should have done it ages ago. I'm Sophia Gold. Come meet my husband, Cal.
And here they are!
No, not anymore. Happy anniversary, scout.
Does that mean Oppenheimer loved the atomic bomb?
Pollution?
I'm the hired help.
I suppose you are going to tell me where it is going.
What?
I can't call an exterminator. I can't afford one. God, I can't even afford my phone. I got fired.
So did I.
That's it. He's cash poor. He kept on me till I finally said okay. I'll bring whatever fits in a nine-by- twelve envelope. I got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, Mr. Walker, in Mexico gave me the envelope.
It's all in lock boxes in a Mexico bank. But he's got a problem. He's -- what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?
With ten thousand? Nine.
I used to bring over ten thousand at a time. That's the legal limit, so I never brought more than that.
Suck my dick... Boom!!
Thelma!
I don't want to talk about it! Thelma, I'm not kidding! Don't you even...
I'm warning you, Thelma. You better drop it right now! I don't want to talk about it!
... in Texas... didn't it? That's what happened... Oh my God.
Okay, Louise... It's okay.
Have I slept long?
What happened to me?
Don't go!
I could cut the ones that are left for you.
What do you feel like singing, Bob?
Your Majesty.
I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
How long then?
And I really wanted some ice cream too.
No! No! You won't come back either.
Where's the ice cream? The H agen- Dazs butter pecan?
Your memory is really getting bad.
You don't have to use pig Latin! Nobody could possibly know what we're talking about.
No you don't.
So he can kill you. You hate your own life that much. You beg for a hero to kill you.
That's really what you want. You become furious when people won't make you dead.
You're begging him to kill you?
He's a child!
-- Is what?
Yes.
Rick? Who's he?
Woman friends, too?
Do you mind if I... ask you why you got divorced?
And do what? Live alone? Go back to school? Find someone else? Start a magazine for confused woman? ... What if I can't do any of those things?
You must get lonely at times.
So what happened?
I'll not denounce you.
What is the matter?
That's a silly joke.
You may keep the pearls -- I don't want them any more -- I'll make you a present of them.
Oh --
Why?
Then what have we been doing? I mean what was the point?
Do we know it's him using the beacon? Not a decoy?
Chances of recovery?
North Korean beaches are the best protected, most heavily monitored in the world. The civilian population is so propagandized that it acts as an Early Warning system. Extraction team has to be small and silent -- I'd go with Seals over Delta Force. Problem is, don't want to hold a conventional sub off-shore for target practice. Where's The Polk?
Unless you Whiskey Run.
Quick-hit technique used by Capone. Rigged a getaway car with running boards and handles. All his guys had to do was jump on and take a ride. Check the files -- DPRK-57 -- I doped it out as a contingency plan: Seal Team infiltrates, picks up the package, links up with recovery sub. But don't waste time opening and closing hatches. They just grab the periscope and hang on for neutral waters.
Listen, Mister LaPlante... uh, Bernie... Who... are... you?
I snuck in.
So?
No, no that was Cadet Dunbar --
Eh, I don't know.
This is the person...you were talking about?
Must be a spare set.
How's Paco doing?
But if she dies...
What do you mean?
What's the recovery? How much are you looking for?
What will you do when the money runs out?
We've got to keep her away from that bastard!
He's the father ! He's her baby's father!
You don't understand! It's her father...
I want out of this marriage.
You promise not to kidnap me and my brother and implant stuff in our brains?
The aliens...In the mother ship. You look just like him.
Do you like kids?
You know how to make chocolate milk?
Hmmph. Hmmph. Nathan, we have to talk, you and I.
Hmmmph.
In the village. Look what I found.
She never would have turned you in, not in a million years.
Oh, tell the story.
...The Albanian Campaign...
Death's like life. Death's a part of life. It isn't frightening. It isn't the end of everything. It isn't quiet and nothingness. It's a part of all eternity.
But you've created a virus that's going to cause a worldwide ecological disaster, just to arrest some hacker kid?
What the hell was that all about?
What?
Jesus. You know, you're sick, Eugene. You...
Adamant.
I don't know, but I am. She was there and then she was gone. I felt it.
Charlie! I said, what time is it?
Half past eleven.
I mean in New York.
Of course.
I couldn't make you see how I felt, Charlie. I just couldn't - I couldn't go threw with singing again. You don't know what it means to feel - to know that people - that an audience don't want you. That if you haven't got what they want - a real voice - they just don't care about you. Even when they're polite - and they don't laugh or get restless or - you know... They don't want you. They just 0
That's when you've got to fight them. That's when you've got to make them. That's -
Half past eleven.
At night?
It's okay...
I wanted to talk to you, I wanted to tell you about the other children.
But I didn't play with them, Daddy. They wouldn't play with me.
It's okay, Mike...
It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal. I don't want to be a reader all my life. I want to write.
I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say.
What?
What are we playing for?
I love you, Walter. Did anyone ever call you anything other than Walter?
Of course it took several years before everything worked like clockwork in that department, so don't be worried if it takes a while --
Kiss my booty.
Well, fine, fine. Fiddle da dee. And how's it working?
Like... clockwork.
So you'll get married in a new dress.
It's a sign.
You don't believe in signs.
Don't bother me, Norman.
I have to reset the sub.
On the tape! There was something else on the tape.
What the hell is going on?!
What was that?!!!
Chris -- Chris -- !
Why would anyone do something like this?
What are you going to do?
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Beethoven. He created it, and yet he never actually heard it. I suppose he heard it all in his head, somehow.
Thanks for coming out.
No, it's just... a sword is a weapon.
I was forty times more fond of my banner than my sword.
Quite a few.
Come on, Harry. This is America, land of the free. I thought we might go skinny dipping. For starters.
I'll pay your way to New York. I'll work, I'll slave. I'll sell my vegetables to the truck farmers, or --
Oh, Mama, don't you understand?
But they're using you!
Oh Ma, they're not using me. It's just a chance to travel, see things. Besides, it's the only way I can get to New York.
Change my name.
Why do you argue with everything I say?
...I suppose.
And nothing. Thomas looked at me straight in the eye and said, "I don't have a father. As far as I'm concerned, that son-of-a-bitch is dead."
Mr Lombard. Mrs De Moraes...
Yep, we had 'em in orange crates all over. It was Daddy's dream. He was goin' to get rich raisin' rabbits. It was what killed Daddy. He didn't drown hisself till a long time later after Momma and Lunette died of typhoid, but it was them rabbits what killed him.
The vine -- the Baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall...
Yes, I'm afraid that would be from the Doll's Eye.
Something wrong?
Yes, and just one time can be enough. Thank you.
Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around.
I'm not with the Agency, Mr. Garrison, and I assume if you've come this far, what I have to say interests you. But I'm not going to name names, or tell you who or what I represent. Except to say - you're close, you're closer than you think...
So how's Norman?
Me?
Viktor, it's my studio.
Took 28 hours. She just wasn't sure about entering this world.
Good luck.
He's a killer, Brian... He's fucking insane.
What?
What are you talking about?
It's Chinese food. It was the only place open. You said you was starving, you'd eat anyth...
...Screw you, yoyo.
It was Beth's idea.
What an incredible view !
Not from the guy with the lowest prices in town.
Victor, I'm afraid for you.
Be careful.
I feel ridiculous. Maybe I should go home and change.
Where are you staying while you're here?
Who said I was a lady?
Not at all.
Lemon?
One more time.
Show me again.
I helped you buy it. It came with two pairs of pants. It's for luck, Johnny. When you propose marriage to a woman, you should kneel down.
Yes, on the floor.
How are you?
You felt obliged to.
Why did you follow me yesterday?
After the market, you followed me to the hotel.
Well, commercials. I read for a soap the other day.
A daytime soap opera.
I was too old.
Somebody's mother.
There was nothing he didn't know. There's a message from the bartender. Does Miss Channing know we ordered domestic gin by mistake?
That French ventriloquist taught you a lot, didn't he?
You're not being funny, I could get actors for less. What about the food?
Look--I think we ought to skip it.
Well, if it's all the same to you--
Why?
I also answer to whistles.
It is not!
...and just take it from him.
...I make two deliveries. The first one with ten thousand, like a dry run. They watch it. See how it works. Then we do a second delivery, when I bring in the half mill.
It would just be helpful to know.
Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different.
Do you like my new look?
I'm trying, you know. I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want.
Really?
Two cents.
Do you see anything you like?
I don't think so, I think she's confused about death.
These are a bunch of burn-outs. And look at this one, I can't even read this one.
Plain or roasted? Alex, I'm very flattered that you've gone out and done all this research.
Yeah, okay. But what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?
No. What are you looking for?
Aren't we a little old for that?
My Barbara was killed. I killed her. Yes, it was my fault. Everyone told me not to drive from the theatre. There was a raging wind that night, and snow and ice. All was well until we got to the Sleepy Hollow bridge. Barbara was singing a little song and then ...I don't know how it happened ..when I awakened, they told me the car was overturned, and they wouldn't let me see Barbara. Barbara was dead.
Ssh!
Just a second, Mike --- Mollie, I got it!
We'll get you out in ten minutes.
What, Howard?
I called you Tuesday at 3:30 and they said you weren't in. Do you remember where you were?
Did you see a message to call me when you got back in?
That's interesting, because I didn't leave a message.
Who'd you have lunch with?
I can't sing it anymore.
That song. I can't sing it anymore. I'm gonna get sick.
Anglo husbands can also be backward.
NO, she wants to be there. And there's Mrs. Kalinsky.
But the motion passed. It's ... it's not democratic of you to ...
I didn't.
John? What is it?
I'm sorry, John, but you have to run again.
She grew up.
She's not alive, but she didn't die.
But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person?
RUN!
Yes.
A crucifix.
The mystery's all gone. And I wanted you to find out who did it.
It's not me, it's dark here... and I can't find the switch.
I will! But I need help!
You tell him. When you're able.
Who did?
You shot her?
How do you know that?
It's not Charlie. It's me.
What?
Yes?
Go on, Laz. You can talk to me.
You take her to a doctor?
A big hurry, be quick about it - so good night, darling, and sleep tight...
You never said you wanted one.
What happened to him?
I'm having dinner with W...
Yes.
Scout's honor.
You're out of your mind.
How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?
Nothing that can't be exchanged.
She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor.
Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair!
You told me.
Yeah.
A little...
That wasn't bullshit, I said we love each other.
Friends? You're crazy! In my building, before, they just cared drugs all day and you couldn't get one, or they just cared video games and you couldn't get one, no more.
This is crazy.
I am so sorry, Mr. Henslowe. I wanted to be an actor. I am sorry, Will.
Nobody knew!
At the exorcism, Birdson boasted that Satan is about to take over the body of a man. You are that man, Peter.
I was awful. I'm so ashamed! I can't sing.
Yeah.
it's my first time.
Oh, no-I mean, I'm just a-auditioning sort of at club. I don't-
I lothe them! I can't stand the sight of them! Stupid bourgeois Parisians, all dressed in black like some private club! I've searched for them the world over and I despise them!
I can feel it from them! They want to know who made us, what became of him. They have their rules, their idiotic rules!
Don't hurt him...
YES!!!
Please, Gabriel, don't...
How about Sunday night? That's always the best time.
Absolutely. Abigail...
Did it hurt a lot?
I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
Thank you. Again.
Let's cool it for now. There's someone I want you to meet.
You are guilty. I'm guilty.
Why can't I go out to your folks' house? Give me one good reason.
Yeah.
Uh, if you could, just, uh, support, uh, a small airfield...
A surprise, he said.
They treating you alright?
Shit.
You too.
Oh, come on! This is such bullshit! The work is getting done, David. Lucky keeps me on top of everything.
I can handle it!
What the hell does that mean? How much more do I have to do to prove how important this magazine is to me?
No, there isn't.
I love Luke, I love the children. But there is more to life than even love...
Are you crazy? What are you doing?
If you're possessed, you can't reveal anything Satan wants hidden. Unless you trick him.
Oh, well, let's see, there was Dennis, from Chippewa Falls High School.
Who is it?
Who is it?
One hour, y'hear? Some Saturday night date you are. Mama warned me this would happen if I married such a serious man.
We? Don't blame me!
Not if they was colored or Meskin. Not if they wanted to keep breathin'.
Nobody's trying to put anything over on you. I'm getting out of here and you can't stop me!
I don't know anything, I tell you. There's been an accident.
I just want to know, that's all.
Obviously there were others, weren't there?
But why not? I thought it was settled. What's holding you back?
You mean, it would be too tough to give me a turndown here. Easier on home grounds.
I killed my math quiz, A-minus.
stands and walks toward the door.
There are plenty of other suppliers in Mexico.
My husband had been working on something he called, The Project for the Children. Are you aware of this?
I don't understand.
Mona?
I got it done.
Lenox Hill. 77th Street between Park and Lex. The emergency number is 327-0800.
You gave me what?! Knots! You gave me knots in here every day -- you made me scared of everything!
I love writing. A-Anne Rice? I love Anne Rice.
But if it's sickening for you --
Thank you.
May I stay then?
Who put you up to this?
You keep looking around, David. Don't you go to school?
We'll get there, baby... we'll get there...
Shh, now. Rest now. Two years, Nick. You haven't had cranberry buns in two years.
I saved you because I love you, Nick. Why'd you save me?
Your letter came yesterday.
Will that be cash or charge?
Course I did.
Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? And you fired me. Jesus.
It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong.
I want a raise. And benefits. Including dental.
I bumped into him after you dropped me off Last night. I didn't feel like going home, so we went for a ride.
You know I never could stand your sarcasm.
And why do you always refer to yourself in the third person, like Napoleon? How come it always turns into an argument with you?
Charlie,. I've been trying to postpone this. But what's the point? It's over. I don't want to hurt you. This is very hard for me. I'm doing this for both of us. I really want you to be happy.
I went to see Prof. Roth! You know, I had another one of those dreams last night. I saw Tommi!
Why not? She can guard the house. By the way, I gave her a name: Clara.
In braids? That's right.
It's a regular college. It's just run by the nuns. The Sisters of St. Anne.
Very good.
Kiss me and I'll tell you.
I'm glad you came. I can't breathe without you.
How about dangerous curves?
I found a lid. It was laying on the ground over there.
He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children.
Give him the manicotta, Bobo. Me, too.
We just can't do it anymore. This is our chance to get away.
He saw her at the Northern Care...
History repeats itself. Everything that happened to Alan Leslie...began with a smear like this...
No, I'm not. I'm not!
I don't have to say that.
Then whose fault was it, J.J.? It was someone's fault, wasn't it?
Why do you do that?
That's okay. It's nice to have someone to talk to--
I can't believe this is happening.
We need help. Please let me call the medium.
That could take days. I need to do something now. Don't you see? She wants us dead.
Alight, alright. Stay calm. You opened this door. There's got to be a way that you can close it.
Jody, she tried to kill him.
I know.
Like what?
I have an idea. But, I mean, I'm just making this up...
All that banging and pounding. I don't know. We should think about making a good first impression.
Is that bad?
You don't trust me to be alone with them.
Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Howard? He'll tell you all about it.
But? But what?
And what you're telling them is keep hating her -- keep up the good work --
I, um, need an estimate on some jewelry I might wish to sell. But d-d-discretion is very important to me b-b-because I don't want anyone t-t-to, um, know that--
But I am That's the killer, honey.
Marion, everyone knows you're not like that--
The character that's supposed to be me, Susan Alexander--
Uh-huh
Yes.
That's really strange. What does it mean?
That what's happening to you, only faster?
What are you talking about?
We're doing something -- ?
We were afraid. Silence seemed better. To come forward seemed like a mistake.
Trials aren't only about truth, Mr. Hooks. Even though they should be. They're about what people believe is true.
It seems human. To me.
A notch above the storage room.
It's much more personal in here.
I thought it was okay where it was.
So where should I put it?
Hm.
She's such a great photographer.
We're always in here. She really gets him, doesn't she?
Closer and closer - until they bite into your throat!
What?
Hello?
Tell me about them, Thea. They have great wings end long teeth --
Lester's left Felicia. He's taking me to Acapulco on the five o'clock flight. He's asked me to marry him.
Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
But --
I made you a sweater. Here... You have to take that off.
Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
He said you didn't have one.
I said "great"...
Oh yeah, I can tell you really love it!
I don't know! God, don't act so jealous I only talked to him for two minutes.
Great...
What?! It looks totally normal... what's wrong with it?
He came into work.
Why? What did he say?
Nothing.
Nothin' to do with it. I ain't never give John the kind of feelin' I give you, so I'm payin' him off now. Don't feel you got to say anything. Way it is, sometimes, you just have a feelin' for a child or you don't, and with John I just didn't.
Laugh it up, kid. You'll make out.
I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
Then help her.
It's my affair too.
How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
I'm only interested...
... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
She is not a child.
And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
???
??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
Have you seen Hugo?
You tell me the fucking truth Johnny... did your parents really die in a car crash? DID THEY?!
You'd better be.
Hello.
You've heard Beethoven before?
Are you referring to the background score?
My God, these people mean to go to war! They really mean it.
I didn't intend to sleep all night! I just pulled over... have I broken any laws?
This isn't pride. It's sheer stupidity!
All they want to see is your work. What's wrong with that?
I'll see you at school, O.K.?
I'm real sorry I had sex with you. I know it wasn't your idea.
So that's cool with you, then?
I thought I might, you know, nip it in the bud before it gets worse. Because I heard in health class that pregnancy often results in an infant.
I know.
I found this old cello case filled with bills and receipts.
I don't sleep all right anywhere. But the house is fine.
If I can survive rush hour, I figure I can handle grizzlies...
I don't jog, Mr. Booker. I run.
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
I thought you lived in Chicago?
Honey -- later, okay? Whoop. Wait.
Sorry, that's my son and the nanny. I had the calls transferred to my home so I could go over your stuff.
... light.
Wait. That's yesterday, from the other office. Today is...
We are?
My sympathies.
Please don't misunderstand... I'd really like to go.
Now I'm embarrassed to tell you.
I think you care more about John Kennedy than your family! All day long the kids are asking, "Where's Daddy?" What am I supposed to tell your kids, Jim!
No!
That sounds dandy, but it doesn't replace a father and a husband on Easter Day.
Some kind of circuitry...?
You're saying... there is no separate primer in the message -- because it's on every page so the recipient can decipher it wherever he is --
Well, I'd like to read them.
Er, you seem to know who I am, and maybe even what I am. Thanks for the breakfast.
Sshhh. "After going through the safety deposit box, I'm sure you'll find you're way to this letter. It's hard to write this to my own children. I could let this die with the rest of me, I suppose. But as one gets older, one fears subside. What becomes more and more important is to be known -- known for all that you were during this brief stay. Row said it seems to me to leave this earth without hose you love the most ever really knowing who you were. It's easy for a mother to love her children no matter what -- it's something that just happens. I don't know if it's as simple for children. You're all so busy being angry at us for raising you wrong. But I thought it was important to give you that chance. To give you the opportunity to love me for all that I was..."
"... It's all there in the three notebooks. Read them in order. If you don't want to, I suppose that's okay too. But in that case I want you to know something -- I never stopped loving your father. He was a very good man. It's just that my love for Robert was different. He brought out something in me no one had ever brought out before, or since. He made me feel like a woman in a way few women, maybe more, ever experience..."
What are you doing?
The phone's out.
A machine. But a machine that does what?
Forget Ricky. You should be glad Max got you driving for me.
I don't like coffee.
Mother! Oh, I'm so glad to see you! Are you all right? Tell me.
Mother!
No one would ever have to know its not him.
You're right, my darling, it's so much more. It's playing with people!
That was incredible. You're brilliant!
Well, we'll have all the money in Malkovich's bank account, plus he still gets acting work occasionally.
Stay in him forever?
Roy, I know what to do with myself! It's a big world out there.
A job? I've never had a legit job in my life!
At what?
Her credit cards. How far am I gonna get with that?
Just a few bucks.
Which number do you want, George?
What do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me.
In the window. Norman's at work.
I don't...
Someone's there.
What?
Your mother called. You shouldn't upset her like that.
You're not sorry. You're scared. You're a psychologist, Norman. You pride yourself on knowing when someone's lying to you, not telling you the truth. And now you're scared ... because you're not sure you can tell anymore.
No.
Oh. Sorry. I was thinking.
As far as I know.
There's nothing to say.
In his office. I saw it this morning.
And where is it now?
I don't think that'll happen.
You're not a man because of a job, Duff.
Does the case lock?
It's in a case, on his desk.
Listen, I just found out we've got real problems in Sicily!
The mafia! La Cosa Nostra!
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?
Where we going?
All right.
Is anything wrong?
We won't. Let's go inside.
Would you like to come in? I could make some coffee.
It's private.
I'll take a chance.
It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news: I pray thee, speak.
I am a-weary, give me leave awhile: Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I!
How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath? Is the news good, or bad? answer to that;
What haste? can you not stay awhile? Do you not see that I am out of breath?
Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
You know, my mom has this saying.
"Don't write any checks you can't cash."
I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well. Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
Uh, home, you know.
Yeah, I talked to your mom. I think I woke her up. I hope I didn't get you in trouble.
You didn't get me in trouble.
Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I! O, my back! Other' other side,--O, my back.
That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
No, I'm sorry. I'm really backward in certain areas.
I'm sorry?
Um-mmm. Oh Nathan, this salad is delish...
Boy, this is good!
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Nathan. I never really learned those things.
What is it you want?
I -- I'm afraid I can't -- not right now. Can I talk to you later?. Yes, that'll be fine. 'Bye.
Yes--?
...What's so damn strange about that?
Hi. I brought some wine.
Not yet, Mr. Clark.
...hell of a price for the country to pay.
Well, I had a really good day, you know that? It was just a real fine way to spend my birthday.
Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass.
Yes, sir.
I thought you hated Torah.
It's ok. That's alright.
Are you learning how to play the piano? What is that?
Seriously, though: We're going to eat, I said.
O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
What happened... ?
My God, you're shot...
No... tell me.
Then, tell me a story.
Well, then, talk to me some more.
Do not swear at all; Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And I'll believe thee.
What is this place?
That's terrible.
Over a girl?
No, I don't.
Where?
In the knee?
Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa!
Did something happen today?
A man tripped and fell on a chainsaw. We got three of his fingers back on.
Deserters would have run, they wouldn't have engaged.
Goodnight, Miles.
I changed my mind. I feel real mean tonight.
You know, there's nothing you have to say. Because they know your heart. You don't have t...
So that's it -- You think I was making fun of your girl in gingham.
What guy? Whose apartment is this, anyway?
First you can't wait to get me up here, and now -- rush, rush, rush! Makes a person feel cheap.
What about this?
Pop!
And this is my room so get out!
You think I'm the WHITE ANGEL?
Yes...
I don't want to. It's different.
I don't know, but you're all men of the church... why not ask Him yourself?
Go onto the next question.
Many things...
Doesn't matter. Doesn't make one bit of difference. Oh God, George, how'd this happen to me? How'd I end up so ... so nothing?
Yes I can...
Lord Wessex. You have been waiting.
Ben.
Yes, I...
Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
Hey! What are you doing here?
I gotta pain in my left side, and my leg throbs like a drum.
Don't worry. I'm gonna take care-a the whole thing.
I feel fine.
Macaulay.
No.
You're calling the shots.
It'll never happen again. I swear.
You don't went to find him. Your news will keep until I tell him.
He's not home.
I just have to relax a little. Not feel so guilty all the time.
Don't be a cop. If you have any doubts about this, it's my fault.
And up a dime.
Three bullets! Any good?
Peanuts?
He's not ready yet.
You had your coaches and your father for that stuff. It never mattered one way or the other if I went to your games.
Forget about it, I don't want you working in one of those honky tonks.
I think I've killed him. Martin, my husband, I've killed him! That is, I'm not sure, but...
I've got to make at least a thousand a week.
What's the pay?
Sure.
Back up.
Mueller was alone in the cabin?
How was your game?
Marriage can really complicate things. So, aren't you gonna say anything about my earrings?
Right.
Oh no, we wouldn't be from the same bloodlines or anything. We'd be like two total strangers who...accidentally had relatives that got married.
Yeah I guess...sort of.
And what?
After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
I adore anything to do with the arts.
Mummy has a special technique called "Deep Therapy."
I'll pay it back, besides, I don't think i'll ever go to class again.
It's okay sweetheart.
Same old Daniel.
Do you know how you will use him?
Manray!
It hit me like a ton of bricks.
It's a Chicago station. I found it the other day.
That is -- if you don't mind changing the lesson, Ma.
Look at the calendar, for Christ's sake. You said a Sunday, not Easter Sunday.
I'll be fine.
Well, I'll leave you alone now. I just came in here to get something of mine.
Thank you.
I have so much to tell you.
Face it. With some guys you have to make the first move. A lot of guys are just... wussies.
Really?
So you took Shawnee, huh?
Yeah.
Don't let me go!
Your color.
Jake. I thought you would be at work, dear.
What? Beth? My Beth?
Because it's about purity...
That's right...
Our weekend. At that sweet little B amp; B.
Uh. Annabelle's video report has been switched again.
Hey, I sold my body to Satan to clear Friday at two o'clo...
No.
Four brothers and five sisters.
I will. Bye.
...I wanted to make you happy.
It's OK...
Please, Mr Crane, it's OK, please--
What's wrong, Brad?
And not with all that buried loot you had waiting for you when you got out. From the Wembley Staduim job, wasn't it? Pink Floyd concert receipts. Jenny would've been ... fourteen at the time?
Yes.
Sounds like Beverly Hills.
Dad?
You're trying to scare me into falsely incriminating myself... and it's not working. I said I'd tell you everything I know. You and your friends behind the mirror.
I don't know.
Yes.
Once a week?
He was gentlemanly. I like that.
Yes.
Yes. I can't help the way I am.
It was like hell with windows. You know, there's shit on the walls. Kids my age sucking their thumbs. I mean, every day I would, I'd wake up in my cell and I'd think, my parents put me here. Why? Why? Because I stayed out all night one time. Uh, because I broke the VCR when I was drunk. Because I was out of control. I thought my parents loved me.
Well, sure, he's rich and he's famous. He's got everything and you've got nothing.
I'll miss you so much.
Go away!
Now, I'm getting interested. I want to know more ---
Well, Flea, I appreciate the respect you just showed me. But I don't need it and don't want it -- not that kind of respect, anyway. It's just gonna hurt us both, okay?
Raymond, Raymond, lower your voice! What's got into you?
I was just getting ready to take a bath.
Hey.
I should be going. You can drop the cup off anytime.
What is that?
I picked them myself. They grow wild up here. Mmm. So sweet.
Oh yeah. There's a lot of stuff. Currants and strawberries ... Here. I'll show you.
Doyle, you're awful. You shouldn't be that way.
He knows that? Billy?
Have you found your man? Is that where he is?
Dreams?
Waal, Mr. Moss, I wouldn't....
Well, hell, maybe that's why you all have been so sick --
I thought the same thing, right off the bat. That's why we went to see the doctor. But hunh-uh. Turns out one's got nothing to do with the other.
The chromium. Well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.
What's chromium?
But it costs money to have an abortion. Even at the Free Clinic. You tell Damone to pay for it. It's the least he can do. It's the guy's responsibility too.
You bet. Paid for a check-up for the whole family. And not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. They just took care of it. Just like that. We never even saw a bill.
Wow. Why would they do that?
Cause of the chromium.
The what?
Whose number do you need?
Don't talk to me like I'm an idiot, okay? I may not have a law degree, but I've spent 18 months on this case, and I know more about those plaintiffs than you ever will.
Excuse me -- Theresa, was it? There are no holes in my research.
Hey -- those are my files --
No.
I said, whose number do you need?
So what gems do you have in your collection?
Oh, yeah. Steph's way into Pinots and Syrahs. Hey, Steph? You sure we can open anything? Anything we want?
You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...
Which ones?
Huh-huh.
Yes.
If it's a date I think you'd better tell me your first name because I --
Are you asking me for a date or an appointment?
He stabbed my mom four times in the chest.
Don't look so freaked.
Wanna walk me home?
Yeah. My parents got divorced. My mom has a restraining order against my stepdad. He has... emotional problems.
Fuck them.
I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
Yes, I work for Jantzen as a sportswear designer.
I can't. I'm seeing a friend.
...I wouldn't know.
I'm sorry, but I'm not here to be your savior.
And that's a bad thing?
I bought it in a pawn shop.
I don't know. In a way, I'm glad it all happened.
Y-yeah.
Sid, there's no baby.
I'm not pregnant. I got my period this morning. There's no baby, Sid.
Lynette, where's Sid?
I'm not sure I know you well enough -- I don't think I'm comfortable.
I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.
Tell them to go away. I don't want to see anybody.
You know, how's everything? You doing okay? How's Frederick? I mean, Elliot.
It'll ruin everything.
Don't, don't, don't...
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
And what would that be?
Nice to meet you.
Absolutely!
Who's ever going to want me? Nobody will.
Very well.
What?... Oh baby...
I felt it happen downstairs and when I went into the bathroom.
I don't have to take a physical in your space ship?
And that's it?
So for four thousand dollars, all I have to do is drive you to your hotel?
Rogers Hornsby's worth like four thousand dollars!
Okay. What the hell? You got a deal. Get in.
So...Mister Andretti, your first time on the freeway?
When? Tonight?
Uh... hang the... uh... carpenter. I...
Okay. Oh god, it's Johnny Horne's birthday today.
I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.
My period.
Ahh, Dr. Helburn, why don't you come in tomorrow-morning at eight o'clock, that's when we open, we'll get you started.
Started what?
Thank you, Bobby. A big score?
I understand.
Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only 33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just 6.99.
I had ordered some books. "The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written."
Not now.
I'm tired of playing overseas. Thinking about giving it a rest for awhile.
I don't need nice. I don't need myself to be it and I don't need anyone else to be it at me.
Now I'm nice? Don't you know any other adjectives? There's careless and snotty and overbearing and argumentative... mumpish.
Why wouldn't you think that about me?
When I was fourteen.
No. He kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. To Cleveland, actually.
Don't touch me.
That's a nice shirt.
Well, I did. And you know what I think? I think that it was almost... too perfect.
Don't hate me but I love this pattern.
No, I wouldn't.
Don't tell me to calm down!
He's not just a Navy captain -- he works for the fucking Pentagon.
You told him about me?
He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
You might want to check those tarot cards one more time.
In the meantime, you said we were gonna have some fun. So let's have some!
Exactly.
Ready when you are.
Thelma, I'm gonna hit the little girls' room, and then we gotta hit the road.
Why don't you ditch that loser husband of yours?
Why don't you tell him to just to get lost once and for all?
Good.
She had a new family. Not enough space for me. Said I should have moved in with her when we were kids. But... whatever.
No. I emancipated myself when I was fifteen.
Not if you remember my dad.
I've stopped a hundred times.
They kept him in juvy for a few years. Now he works over at Dale's Autobody.
Sam's favorite.
What have you been before today?
Do you remember?
Harry... I met someone.
Come here a minute.
No.
Is it morning yet?
Tom, come here a moment. I think this canvas report is about ready to go out. Check it out with Andy, and if he okays if, have a copy made for the campaign headquarters in every county. And don't forget to add the new photo releases.
Michael.
Have you known him long?
OK. I love you.
Donna, you are such a crack up. You don't even like Mike. Is this what you are going to do to show me you are not uptight.
I'm not a youngster. I can understand.
You want a muffin?
I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set.
We're supposed to go to the lake.
That's what you said the first time we met. You didn't even know me.
No, I'm not! I'm finished.
You're ruining us. If we stay with you, you'll take us down with you. This isn't political, Dick. This is our life.
The girls will grow up. They only know you from television anyway.
Dick, don't...
What's the matter?
You want to try it?
This stuff could kill... Be my guest.
Hi.
Did you see Hiromix last night dancing with Bambi?
Let's never come here again, because it would never be as much fun.
Why do they switch the r's and l's here?
Mauduh...
Don't do anything foolish -- I'm alarmed about you.
I'll give you what you need -- I have money.
Why later?
You must go now. Be careful on your way to your room.
Six twenty-seven in the morning... But the money?
Cut away from me?
They don't? Then why do they still write me fan letters every day. Why do they beg me for my photo- graphs? Because they want to see me, me, me! Norma Desmond.
Indeed it is.
Where did you get that sweater?
I should leave.
Bet the sheets are grey.
Right, the one Simone gives me. Simone and I'll make the switch at Robinson's May. She knows what I look like?
He doesn1t have fungus, does he?
Worst time at year for dogs is when they get fungus.
Well, you'll get it, skin as sensitive as yours.
Is 'their' colour an expression of their inner self? By that I mean, extroverts wear bright colours - so what are people who wear white?
If that knife is missing, I'll look for it in your back.
Do I wanna go to Memphis and get married?
What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do.
Some Hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.
Now who's show up at this hour? It's time people went home - hold that coat up... ... whose is it?
Mr. Sampson's birthday. I certainly wouldn't forget that. You'd never forgive me. As a matter of fact, I sent him a telegram myself...
Yes, I guess you were. It - it was very thoughtful of you, Eve.
Yes, dear. You forgot all about it.
Hollywood.
Discouraging, isn't it? Women with furs like that where it never gets cold...
I'm going to give her a wedding present. Thought I'd better do it now, before I forget it. I can drop them on my way to... That's funny.... Where are those bonds?
I know I left them there.
We're all angels, you know ... ... and devils. It's just what you choose to see.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
You come out here and talk to me, you fucker!
I'll take chocolate.
We were lying in the sand. It was my eighteenth birthday... We were so awkward... I would have married him anyway...
He tried to burn Dunbar to us. You don't do that if you're not involved.
Hold me tighter.
Just one minute, you! Don't you ever talk to me like that!
That's an old maid's tale.
Salesmen and cops are the ones. If you'd ever waitressed, honey, you'd know.
Don't call me "mack," honey.
You better hold onto your tongue!
After Charlie told Walter that he broke up with you because he wanted to play the field, Walter decided he should do the same thing.
Can we see it from the back yard?
They have a right to know. Howard is a thief. He steals the truth. I can't remember my baby! I can't remember my baby. It existed and I can't even remember. Do you understand that?
I won't allow it. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. What do you think of that? That's from my quote book.
It's terribly sweet of you, Jason.
Remember the Alamo! Remember the Alamo!
Jesus Christ! And you never told me?
How long have you been doing this?
But you're always at the library.
Ed, I'm so proud! I'll read it as soon as I get home.
I know.
Yeah, but I don't like it.
Why, Terry, who said it was?
What?
He was looking at everybody the same way. Asking the same question.
I never met such a person. Not a spark of romance or sentiment or or human kindness in your whole body.
Oh, he's a keeper all right.
Don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.
Could be worse. Oh sorry, forgot who I was talking to.
I'm so glad you like each other. I was so scared, so scared.
Sure I do, Earl.
Don't talk too loud.
Well, maybe you think I could!
Questions about sex.
Well, like what did he ask, exactly?
Well, like, I don't want to tell you, exactly.
Oh, so you'll let a total stranger record your sexual life on tape, but you won't tell your own sister?
I know, but this... I just feel like everybody I know right now is obsessed with sex.
He just asked me questions.
Apparently.
Did he ask you to take your clothes off?
Bill
Not anything, Bill. Don't test me.
Wow.
Madame Curie, Jonas Salk, Norman Spencer...
You are so brilliant.
My baby.
You promised to stay on the wagon.
Here, Mom. Drink this. You know, you're awful. You probably were flirting.
I was suddenly thinking about going to bed.
I'll make you something.
Think what the play means, William. Perhaps these words have a place in the real world.
Voltaire, of course...
Remember, George, "It is dangerous to be right in matters on which the established authorities are wrong."
We've eaten.
It's not like I can't go out and have fun with my friends.
Tell me you're not calling on your car phone?!
Yeah.
Spencer.
He's gotta fight to breathe. His asthma can just shoot off the charts -- he's allergic to dust and this is New York and his immune system bails on him when there's trouble so an ear infection... Is this bothering you?
An ear infection can send us to the emergency room -- maybe five, six times a month where I get whatever nine-year-old they just made a doctor. Nice chatting with you.
Oh, THX... hold me, hold me, THX holds her tightly, tears in his eyes. They kiss, and LUH hides her head in THX's chest.
How d'you mean?
Why didn't you ask him? Sol knows you!
Toby -? Oh, hi! How are you?
You did okay, back there. I was fairly impressed.
And you wouldn't be.
Yeah, and I'll bet his initials are Sidney J. Mussburger!
Yes. They're my friends.
I've seen you. From the window.
Are we going in this?
It's pretty old.
Pop?
Oh.
Mommy won't let me eat fast food. You know that. It's bad for you.
About three years.
I'd forgotten that.
You know why, don't you? Because I am patient, chain-smoking Lillian.
Be open with me. I'd like that.
That's very lovely actually.
I want to know. We haven't talked this way in years.
How can you just give up like that? You had a real shot at playing college ball and you let one case of mono stop everything. Don't you want more? To move out of Mom and Dad's? Pay your own bills?
For your information, I am very happy. Deliriously happy. I lead a very happy life!
That's not an answer.
Tastes can change.
Not true. Shall I tell you what you were thinking? You were wondering if I was wearing anything under my skirt.
Junior.
No.
I don't know. Relationships seem too distracting. I'd rather concentrate on my studies.
No.
Are you often this offensive on a first encounter?
We can hope. You still have your job, right?
I got your bail continued.
I think our best course right now would be to focus on the Probation Officer's report...
He means prison, Mr. LaPlante.
Nashville...?
Thanks, honey.
Does anybody out there want something to drink?
I'll take care of it.
I thought there were too many forks on the table.
Well, one was for salad...
I don't believe you.
Cuz it's dark and quiet and you can see into another world.
You swear?
You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
But I've got school.
You swear?
Now I m worried...just say it. Whatever it is we ll deal with it.
Okay...
Worse, you mean...
Yes, you can get carrot juice or Italian coffee, and the people there -- well, none of them quite fit in. You'd love it -- why don't you come there with me -- they're having a marathon poetry reading on New Year's Eve. I go every year.
And now...?
...The people look like ants.
Well -- this year -- if it's good I plan to make it a tradition. Uh, my it certainly is beautiful --
Because I try to be nice to people?
I'm not wasting my water on him.
I don't care what he says, he wanted our gold. Would have slit our throats if he had the chance.
All last night he could have been--
He...he could have been watching us.
Says he wanted food. Liar. He wanted the gold.
Speaking of thanks... we puttem back in, what does your fellow Moss want?
Go on, take it. Then you can't spend the rest of the trip expecting to get paid.
They're losing one mother. They can't lose two.
No, I'm not all right. I'm soaked and I hit myself against that rock.
All my clothes --
Jesus, Andy! Can they cure it?
Wait. Where is he?
Who is he?
You have a brother?
How'm I doing so far?
-- why?
He retired.
Upstate.
Henry, no!
Oh, Roy, it was great! We were rolling in dough, lived wherever we wanted, only pulled two or three scams a year.
Atascadero.
I don't understand. What do you want from me?
We know you, we've seen you before like this. Is it over - or just beginning?
Thank you.
What is he talking about?
The kid - junior, that is - will be right down. Unless you'd like to take her drink up to her...
I had an abortion two weeks ago.
Right.
-- gee...
I found out I was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.
Not ashamed.
-- go ahead.
And when I try to talk to you seriously, when I try to explain to you the unlimited creative power of life, how beautiful it would be if we gave up this hopeless struggle and simply loved each other from our hearts, what do you do -- you mock me!
Why in the h...
Why is that?
Just, I mean, well, you're here every single day.
He's at work while I'm here.
I guess I'd just be jealous if I were him.
Well, he doesn't need to worry.
If my kids and my wife were always at an ex-husband's house, I'd worry.
He's not the type to worry.
Where's that?
Cherry-red Tears.
I just had a really strange experience.
I have a funny feeling. Do you think we'll get over all that's happened?
Maybe I should talk to Dr. Roth about it.
How can you avoid a man you've never met?
Waldnit von Schnechter. Prewar.
You know who it once belonged to?
This is a very special, very old CB 275...
Thank you... Oh no, don't put it on there...
What do you mean?
I'm sorry.
Sure you do. You got all that wedding stuff.
You're still excited by my irreverence. You haven't yet started to think of it as my "gratuitous need to shock."
Not embarrassed.
Yay. Meet me after work by the old mill.
Is she here? George, Kristina hates you. You fucked her over one too many times. And I'm not here to socialize. Did you hear about Diego?
But it would hurt.
Don't call me stupid.
You mean this chocolate cake?
Huh.
... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
... So am I, my boy - so am I.
Of course! By kid-lawyers!
Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
In there, sir.
-- Yesss?
Jack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you.
I won't. Goodnight.
What's eight, ten years? Hell, you'll still be ambulatory. I think.
Everything's gonna work out. The kids and I...we're going to love each other.
How could I be? We learned some magic...
Evil.
You know what I want? I want you both to be friends. I know you both, respect you both. You should be friends.
Thank God!
To meet interesting people, improve myself. You wouldn't believe the losers we got over in Port Angeles.
I'm a housewife.
Let the child stay.
On the dark nights on the stormy nights -- you can hear him. He passes like the wind; The flapping and fluttering of his great cloak beating like gaunt wings. The thunder of his horse's hooves is loud, loud and louder, beating hard, beating strong on the frozen ground as he comes riding, riding, riding.
Goodbye.
Congratulations on the deal. How exciting. Is Sally doing Sally? I mean it's Sally. The character that's based on Sally. The character that's based on Sally in the book.
Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful.
But I am right, yes? She's based on Sally.
Still. Well. Let's drop it.
I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. Mostly non-fiction. Did you read the new Styron?
Delmar? I never go out to California. That's a thousand miles from here.
Are you sure?
Well, well. In a real hurry, are we?
You aren't taking me for granted, are you?
What business is it of yours..?
Look, Father, ah... just because I don't subscribe to the... to the beliefs you subscribe to...
What does this have to do with..?
Who told you this?
You know what we have in common?
I don't understand. Are you expecting me to..?
It's not your fault. See, you have this condition...
She's really getting to you, isn't she?
I knew by your nervousness that Naomi wasn't the kind of girl who forced you to criminally trespass.
Yeah. What's your girlfriend's name?
Ah-ha! Now I can look for candles, matches, and the liquor cabinet.
No, it's our house! Just tonight -- -- we're David and Ruth Laskin. Which one do you want to be? I prefer to be Ruth but I'm flexible. Alcohol! You make drinks. I'm going find the bedroom and slip into something more Ruth. I'm ruthless at the moment.
It's that disgusting hot dog you had for lunch.
No. Right here on the beach. Come on. Let's do it.
Tom, let's spend the night here.
She'll come back. That's why I'm going to... to not have this baby.
No. There's no way. I mean, don't you think there's no way?
No you don't. And fuck you for saying you do. And fuck you for "saying... ...for saying there's just no way. Because there could be a way, Grady.
Who's gun is that?
Heavy. Smells like gunpowder.
Um--hello? I've got like a social emergency here.
Well, I am.
Don't give me that shit. I want my money.
What do you mean 'stole'? I didn't steal anything from you.
Get lost?
Get lost?
Well, how 'bout that?
And have you heard anything from our dear friend, Sally? What with all the rumors getting back to England. I thought she might inquire after us. But then I believe she always looked down on us.
That's when Sally Fairfax was tutoring you...
Nothing, Jabez -- just natural for a baby to cry, sometimes. Shh, little Daniel -- sleep -- sleep --
Where do you kill them...
Who told you?
The story behind the story, the ugly scandal behind the falling millionaire, the dirt, you mean.
I don't know... please... tell me I'm dead...
No, no jokes, I gotta pee. Just tell me about your day. What went on back there?
I... don't know... what do you want from me?
Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it.
It was a play.
I have expectations, too.
Maybe.
Fine! Eat in the cupboard.
It's ok to ask that.
You quit.
Fine.
Why?
Here.
I'm almost done making it. Alright Ben -- you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were AAAAGGGGHHHH!
Please.. You shouldn't laugh --
Want to come up the house? You can stay there till you get on your feet. There's no point paying a hotel.
She drank too much. That's what killed her.
I have to help him!
I'm glad you learned sign language, Elijah, but I'm tired of your nagging. I'm tired of this conversation. I'm tired period. What has the world ever done for me that I should feel personally responsible for saving it?
...what are we going to do...?
Oh, Lord....
I'm thirty-seven years old.
Thanks anyway.
Jeff!
Don't be so hard on yourself.
What's thirty-seven? I had Chiro after I was thirty-seven. It ain't over till it's over.
I know!
He wasn't.
Houdini mice.
And we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t-t- teeth and I'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place So we set t-t-traps everywhere. And every morning we would find the t-t-traps sprung but no mice!
Jesus was not bad.
Probably you -- your brother -- school -- The solar system...The usual...
Why not?
Walter's on campus, being the good soldier for WordFest. But he's a basket case. Someone stole Marilyn's jacket last night. And Poe's missing, too.
So we'll sell the house.
They lived a long time ago -- before you and I were born.
Do Peter Sellers again.
All the ugly phone calls? We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH.
Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. Because, God help you if something happens to that dog?
Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky.
Here it is, right here.
We'll miss you very much -- Bobby and I. He won't have anyone to play with.
No. That's all finished.
I think I'm very lucky. You don't always get a chance to recognize a mistake before you make it.
That's where we came from first.
I'm kidding. Hello?
I'd like to stay, Ma. I love the house. But Pop don't like Johnny.
Now you're asking.
No.
Oh, I'm really, uh, looking forward to tomorrow. I mean, you know, I think that it'll be really nice to meet Mother and Father.
No, I don't think so. No, I don't think they're gonna hate you at all. On the contrary, I think-
It's Easter. You know, we'll have a nice dinner, we'll sit down and eat. I think they're gonna really like you.
Maybe an orange juice.
Does it look okay?
Wow... finally.
It just came yesterday...
What?
And they won't be able to tell?
Did you remember to pay the phone bill?
Thank you.
Maybe I was wrong on that one.
Okay... Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish.
I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like...
It was something my father always liked me to do.
Not if you don't want me to.
I don't know Tommy.
Absolutely.
Just putting in an appearance then.
Yeah. Poor guy. Have anything to drink?
Are you--scared?
Thank you.
You're a whiz kid. So perceptive, so --
Oh, hey, Patrick.
It's freezing out.
Any untoward "revelation" regarding, uh...
Okay.The Fantasy Inn.
Father, that's enough now
How many?
Say you shortchanged me and you shortchanged yourself.
Say you'd be the luckiest son of a bitch on Earth if I didn't up and quit over all this.
Say you were wrong.
Geeeerta Rauuuss!
You found us in the Penny Saver?
No.
I'll get drinks. What would everyone like? I've got Pellegrino, Vitamin Water...
I work for Patchett. I had a feeling that there was someone else, but I never knew who.
I know how he feels.
I'm going to take it.
Mmm.
I live there.
Hey, don't squish it, and after it's dead, flush it down the toilet, okay? And flush it a couple o' times.
Well I put it in. That one. You just set there. I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.
I got it Mama.
I put it in, Mama.
I felt like black.
This is too much. You don't even have the money and you're wasting it.
Well... what do you think about then? I mean... well what do you think about?
It is not my riding day, my lord.
Looking for my room -- one sixty- six.
Yes -- oh!
For tonight.
And Baron, thanks so much for everything.
I didn't realize I was out.
What kind of deal?
If I knew you any better I'd say that doesn't sound like you.
Wow. Anyway, I think it's amazing you're getting it published. Really. I know how hard it is. Just to write it even.
No, no, no, no. You can't take him away now. This is his night. Won't you introduce us, Wolfgang?
Excuse me, Wolfi. Mama is not feeling very well. Can we leave now?
What?
Wait a minute. Listen.
That's from her -- that woman.
I uh, by and by I come--But if thou mean'st not well, I do beseech thee--
Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow, By one that I'll procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite; And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
Juliet!
Don't you hear it?
I thought so too, doll. I guess we were mistaken.
But Maxine, I thought it was me you loved.
Really? Well, you know, he's quite good. I'm surprised. Anyway, I have a session with Malkovich I have to attend. I'll speak with you soon.
Maxine! Listen: It hasn't been me in John the last three times. Craig's had me locked up in the apartment. He made me call you at gunpoint. It's been him! Oh, God, it's been him!
Hello, Thomas.
Yeah ...
But you are needed. Especially now -- with most of the other men away. You're captain of the stand-by squad.
Ram n -- you can't.
When?
Where are you going?
What, did you think he was raised by a pack of wolves? Don't be misled by the haircut.
There is no letter. I made it up.
There is no letter.
There is no letter.
Adam, this isn't like you. Please come to the office. There must be something we can do.
Ray did ... and then they closed the set.... everybody's gone. You'd better get down here Adam!
Can't we --
What about the girl?
Shouldn't we --
Look! Police!
You've got to talk to Ray you've got to fix this.
What exactly do you do?
Nice.
Let me go.
Rebecca Lawson.
I don't feel well.
Why?
A little after eleven.
She said she was having a drink in the hotel with a friend. You waited for her in the parking lot and told her she was too drunk to drive home and that you would get her a room for the night.
I assume his girlfriend.
I had some papers to pick up.
Thanks, Wick.
Oh, no, millions of people come up to you and say, "Hey, I have something I just wrote," right?
Actually, I wanna see Jeffrey Pommeroy.
I just called to say that I'm having a really great time.
Hi Dad.
Don't worry, I'll do it in my own subtle way.
Yeah.
You bet your life. "The mill wheel goes around...some times it's even under water -- then it rises up, as high as it can go..."
Well, first, you got to change the title...
Come gentle night. Come loving black-browned night give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, take him and cut him out into little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of love but not possessed, and though I am sold, not yet enjoyed. O, tedious is this day, as the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them.
I don't need you! I have my own fuckin' money!
I'm going' to the FBI! I'm not scared anymore!
That's funny -- so am I. What did you do with the cards?
Where are you going? BUD Who knows? Another neighborhood -- another town -- another job -- I'm on my own.
Mind if I come in?
Are you all right?
Are you sure? How's your knee?
I would prefer it if you kept away from LESLIE
I hope that J.J. really likes Steve, that it isn't an act.
Sure... tonight. Then please stay at my place.
I hate to think of you in that cheesy motel. I mean...
Let's face it, what the fuck are you doing in Las Vegas?
It wasn't so important to me. I mean, he never asked me why I was a hooker, and that was impressive. I really liked him. So I decided to just play my part. I mean... it's good to help someone once in a while, it's a bonus to being alive, and that was my plan... to stay alive. I suddenly came to a decision.
Ben, why don't you stay at my place tonight? I mean... look, you're so drunk. I like you. I trust you.
You heard me - keep away from him
Just sit me up. Nice and tall. Bring Benjamin first.
That's repulsive.
What?
Not yet!
That's an order!
Do as I say!
I won't...is Missy in heaven, do you think?
Yes.
Hey buddy. You okay ?
The one on the left - definitely...
I've got a tenant coming over later - can I take the afternoon off?
The press think that the WHITE ANGEL is a woman - why is that? Do you dress up LESLIE?
Let's go upstairs, okay?
What exactly is a cardigan anyway?
That's not him... Jesus, stop freaking me out.
Oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!
I wanted you back.
It'll cost you.
Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you?
It's worse. I think there's something going on between Cecile and her music teacher.
Well... you promise you won't say anything to her. We've developed a friendship and...
Did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? Barry, did you ask Walter to get you a shrink? What's wrong with you? Are you ok?
I'll leave then, I'll go to get something from my car, go away so you don't feel pressure. Can I ask you a serious question:
I'm not gonna rag you. Why would I do this just to rag you?
You don't do anything, why are you being scared?
You're being weird again, see. Come on. Please don't be weird.
I have no idea.
I wanna take it anyway. Just in case.
We don't need the lantern. The place has electricity.
It was the first time somebody ever saw the real me, the me that nobody else knows.
We'd have to. That thing barely makes it down the driveway.
Oh yeah, sure, Thelma, that lantern will come in real handy. Maybe we could tow your car behind, in case he steals the spark plugs.
In case there's some escaped psycho killer on the loose, who cuts the electricity off and tries to come in and kill us.
Thank you.
Last time you asked me to come along I nearly got a hole in my head.
Maybe. If I come visit, we can find out.
Is it such a chore? I don't understand you.
She didn't give me one. I told you before, Melanie wasn't part of the plan. Ordell must of told her to do it. She bursts in, grabs the shopping bag, and takes off. What am I supposed to do, go after her? I'm in my fucking underwear. I had to get dressed before I could do anything. So I put this back on 'cause could put this on faster than I could my uniform.
How do you know? How do you even know what goes on in this house anymore! You're too busy making speeches, stirring up every crazed Klansman in Louisiana after us!
I'm leaving. I'm taking the kids and I'm leaving! I won't stand it anymore.
You and your government! What's the matter with you? Don't you have any feelings? Your daughter! What kind of man are you?
Jim, before this Kennedy thing, nothing mattered to you in this life more than your children. The other night Jasper tried to show you a drawing. You didn't even notice he was there. He came to me bawling his little eyes out. Jim, he's sensitive - he needs more from you.
It may sound like music to her -- I can do better with my teeth in a cold Shower. Click click click.
You had a rough couple years, that's all.
You should know better.
Oh, you'll help him now, Richard, won't you? You'll see that he gets out? Then he'll have his work, all that he's been living for.
Just before you and I were to leave Paris together. A friend came and told me that Victor was alive. They were hiding him in a freight car on the outskirts of Paris. He was sick, he needed me. I wanted to tell you, but I, I didn't care. I knew, I knew you wouldn't have left Paris, and the Gestapo would have caught you. So I... well, well, you know the rest.
Now? I don't know. I know that I'll never have the strength to leave you again.
It wasn't long after we were married that Victor went back to Czechoslovakia. They needed him in Prague, but there the Gestapo were waiting for him. Just a two-line item in the paper: "Victor Laszlo apprehended. Sent to concentration camp." I was frantic. For months I tried to get word. Then it came. He was dead, shot trying to escape. I was lonely. I had nothing. Not even hope. Then I met you.
Sorry, Bleek... Going for my ultrasound. Gotta note and everything.
Darling!
Sorry.
Tell him how you feel -- you miss him. Tell him you're sorry.
I can't do it, Walt.
U.S. History. Mr. Hand.
Hi, Brad.
Wait a minute --
I -- I don't know, dear... Perhaps there's some mistake.
Those are priceless sculptures.
Honey?
It means we're probably to tired to remember.
Uncle, you mustn't think that I won't be sad to leave you.
Gee whiz "Bud", what could we possibly need when we have each other?
I told you. Nothing --
You don't know no girls around here. You're lyin', You're runnin' away !
What?
What were your parents like?
Just that it's been a perfect day and that I'd like to skip my fancy dessert and go home after this.
You're right, you know. We don't have much time.
Unfortunately ...
Like a veil has been lifted?
Writing seems easy.
Do you think you could answer that?
I see.
No.
Yes, the telephone, but if it's for me, I'm not in. HUGO You're not in.
...On payday! The only story here is how this guy made a monkey out of you, Al.
I filed it yesterday.
Sez me! Amy Archer. Why is he an Idea Man -- because Hudsucker says he is? What're his ideas? Why won't they let anyone interview him?...
What's wrong with you?
No. Jody, listen to me. You have to listen to me. This is not something that I can do right now. Whatever it was, it's gone. I need it to be gone now.
Dad, didn't you say you needed prunes REAL bad?
He's not kidnapped he's -- he's just hiding -- he's just -- BENNNN? GODDAMMIT!
Uh, tie them up, Rosie. If you will.
Eat shit, thumbtack dick! Thank you, Frank. You're the best.
Oh, Rosie.
Almost.
And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her.
Strong enough to get you down the aisle?
Of course it is.
Please, don't misunderstand me, Mr. Richards. I think that part of Miss Channing's greatness lies in her ability to choose the best plays... your new play is for Miss Channing, isn't it, Mr. Richards?
There was an item in the Times. i like the title. 'Footsteps on the Ceiling'.
Well. If I didn't come to see the play, I wouldn't have anywhere else to go.
Not with you in them. Not by Mr. Richards...
There are other plays...
Maybe this Jeffrey guy is...is my real father. I mean...look at me, I have the hair of a dead person and...and my nose, no one in my family has this nose, it could be the nose of...a...of a complete stranger,
Hold lunch!
Are you saying my mother had another husband?
What're you saying?
Maybe not...but maybe it does. If no one told me about this, I mean...maybe they're trying to hide something.
They sure did! They got kicked out of school, they married truck drivers...these are my mother's greatest accomplishments? I'm sure glad I came all the way out here to find them out.
What if he's kidnapped?
I don't feel very festive.
Maddy's party.
Charlie's downstairs. Why aren't you ready?
Straight ahead.
... You know, and I know, that the only thing standing between a life sentence for Venza and his freedom is my testimony at his trial...
... I don't want to talk about it...
... He killed Win... he enjoyed it...
Are we dressing for dinner?
Say, you're pretty good with that racquet.
Shall I light the candles?
I see you bought some napkins.
You be careful, Tommy. Don't you be stickin' your nose in anything.
I think I ruined the sauce...again.
Well, why not a little of the King?
Hey, bud.
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that one movie.
Oh?
...and then she just breaks down. And he has this sweet daughter...and when she goes to college next year, he's going to split permanently. I mean...
Oooo.
Oh, yeah.
Well, I, I really like that. I think that's a pretty color on you.
Where was that house? The one in LA, I mean.
Yes. One of my friends was there. I wonder if you ever clipped her.
Let's stay for a while.
I've missed the best sun. Why did you have to pawn your watch?
I thought I'd never see you again!
Central High, 'n' matinees, the Bijou Theatre.
Excellent. What a charming, peaceful place, Uncle.
I thought I was fucked up.
If you see anything from the inside it makes sense. You ought to hear perverts talk. A guy once almost had me convinced to let his dachshund fuck me.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Tod'll meet you at the bookstore at Eddy and O'Farrell tomorrow noon. I told him you were a 'specialty' customer.
Well, you tried. You failed miserably, but you tried.
Rot in hell, honey. He's busy now.
Can't sleep?
I want to ride my own bike.
Okay.
Well, did you or didn't you?
Can I count on that? I just want to see Lester with me and that cunt in the same room tonight.
What are you saying? Oh, God -- you're going on assignment again ...
You said you'd be here! You promised me -- you promised Jamie! What could be more important than that?
Just curious. If there's a problem, I guess I'll just call you there to interrupt.
I suppose. Why?
Is it a big party? A big neighborhood party?
We're going to the Halford's. The number's on the calendar in the kitchen. We should be home around 11.
Oh lord. You think I'm so dense. And now you want to be seen with your dense wife at the cocktail party. You want to wear that ridiculous shirt which doesn't go with those pants at all. You want to wear that, and you want me to shake hands with your friends and make conversation and dress up in an outfit that shows a lot of cleavage and you're not going to accord me the respect of talking honestly about this... You don't really know what this feels like.
Who was that?
Never let a freshman take your spot.
Thanks... we're taking your cab.
Just get in and shut up. I'm not asking you to do anything. I just need you to come with me.
He just fell asleep. Josephine's with him.
Yes?
I suppose your grandmother's house when she passed on. But we sold that right away. Your cousin Shirley bought it.
Heavens no. We had a hard enough time keeping the mortgage on this place.
Yeah. Otis Elwell. The columnist.
And he's a perfect stranger to me.
What do you want all of a sudden - Lady Godiva...? Where's my other shoe?
Don't you think I have any feelings? What am I? A bowl of fruit? A tangerine that peels in a minute?
For what?
Right now -- we'll drive down to Ramey and get the base chaplain to marry us.
Please, you're just as ambitious as I am, more --
And you think I don't want those things? You think I don't stay up half the night wondering if I've made the right choice living half a world away from you, wondering if any of this is worth what I'm giving up for it everyday? Let's get married.
But what about your research -- ?
But the work --
Don't get dirty, Dad --
That's all?
'Be deliriously happy'. I'm going to do my upmost --
Bravo.
I'm sorry. But give it to me again. The short version.
Really?
How?
How are you going to tell me what I have time for? I mean, whatever I did...we can fix this.
Can I call you?
I want more.
You don't think so?
Okay, baby.
What do--? You're being ridiculous.
Jackie --
Yes, that'd be nice.
Sure.
That ain't the way they're tellin' it. They're sayin' you done it fust.
They know he got hit in the face.
Equally incongruous is Oswald becoming chummy with the White Russian community of Dallas - all rabid anti- Communists.
Well?
Jesus, Jack...
Let me help you. Betty Schaeter, Sheldrake's office.
Hey look!
The next thing we know he's living in Dallas Ft. Worth in October '62 working 6 months at Jaggars-Chiles- Stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the U.S. Army... He starts work only days before the government reveals Russian missiles in Cuba and the crisis explodes. Oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the U2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the Army Security Agency.
A lot's happened since last weekend.
You really love me, don't you?
Charlie, let's make love.
I think he's high on drugs. He hit me, then took off. I'm afraid to be alone. Please come over.
Oh GOD ...
Over? It can't be. I've come to read with her. I promised Max.
Really, Jill, aren't you exaggerating just a little? Five times a day?
I'm impressed you can sew.
You sew very badly.
Will you please come in?
Don't.
Depends on what you call love. When I was growing up I had nothing. I learned to want everything. I wanted more than Sierra anyway. Jake was my ticket. He's not much; he's older than me, different than me, but he's got more money than half this town put together. I courted him. I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
A woman should never learn to sew, and if she can she should never admit to it. Close your eyes.
Good bye, Grandma.
Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom.
You don't do that, you don't call him, you don't know to get involved in the bussiness of his, of his of my family. this is the family, me and him do you understand? You understand? NO ONE ELSE. THERE IS NO ONE ELSE. That man, his son does not exist. HE IS DEAD. HE IS DEAD and WHO TOLD YOU TO DO THAT?
Dad, why are you dressed up to go to bingo?
I won't lie.
The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
How we doin' on that vehicle?
Where you girls from?
Oh, yah?
A Neolithic bronze ... Reminiscent of the Nias Island cultures ... It ' s very curious. Defiantly Pagan. The use of ivory for the spear is quite unique ... What do you think?
I photographed it extensively, father.
Well aren't you the smoothie. Now you're going to ask for my number, I suppose.
Angola. My mother was being a surgeon there. She volunteered. Mozambique and Mali, too... ...those days, in those days...she was part of Cuba's gift to the third world. She came from a bourgeois family with a house in Verdado...we still have the house. We will go there...
She's dead...
I'm afraid you have mistaken my motive, Louis. I thought you might understand and sympathize.
Are we?	I thought I was very gay.
Life has betrayed us. We've found there is no heaven on earth, so we must worship evil for evil's own sake. We're not wicked. We commit no violence, unless...
Uh huh, I wanna hear this part.
So, what's up with you? Another busy night selling porno to wireheads?
Buncha techno-perv jerkoffs.
Jeez, you're pathetic. Okay, I got a pickup at the St. James. I'll take you there, you can get a cab.
Lenny, this may be a hard concept for you, but friends don't have to pay their friends.
Driving Mr. Lenny.
Oh yeah?
No. No, I don't.
I don't know. There's a small community of us. We have a place they don't know about. We're happy. We'll keep trying to figure out a way. Come stay with us. Join the struggle.
No, you idiot. I said "Is it a receptacle tip?" Not, is Luis a despicable twit. Is it a receptacle tip? Get off me.
Yeah. I was going to kill him from the inside.
Pull out, goddamnit!
Hi.
Patrick. Turn on the Light. He turns on the light.
I know.
You must think I'm pathetic.
Honest to goodness, I hate you.
Do you want posters, too?
...I've never been in a man's apartment before.
Dmitri didn't want the money?
Oh, Meetoo! You look miserable! Oh, Vlad - look at him!
Poor Meetoo!
Cut it out, Vlad! I'm not angry with you anymore - I know how much you needed the money.
And how come you guys are the only ones with your pictures on the poster?
Changed?
Just.
You married?
What is that, Mr. Bones?
You know, there ought to be a Congressional Medal for men like you. America's comfort to misunderstood wives. I never thought I would find myself in that class.
I'm not afraid of you. You haven't got a moustache!
Why, Matt!
Josh and I are going to South Coast. Wanna ride? Maybe see a movie?
Your dad dated my mom after her divorce.
I know you. I saw you through the floor, didn't I?
Yes, Mister McMurphy.
Me?
Based on what? You never even see him.
Oh, no, no, no. He's my sister's husband. And I think if you gave him half a chance, you'd like him. He's very intelligent.
I asked my dad and Bren not to narc us out to your folks, so we should be safe.
The guy is super cool! His name is Mark and he's into old horror movies and he plays guitar. I actually hung out with him today.
Jesus, Bleek.
I'm going to really start looking like a dork soon. Will you still think I'm cute if I'm huge?
But...you called.
No, Fidget, I...
No...
It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something...
Good.
I don't know, this is strange to me, you know.
Hi.
Look at these people behind you. I'm totally convinced they're Satanists.
So, when are we going to start looking for our apartment?
Soon... I have to wait and see how this Summer class goes.
Did you sign up yet?
Yeah, I just picked the one that sounded the easiest.
They won't be riding in the wagon.
You can't leave us here.
Yes.
But you're not. You're somewhere else. You're someone else --
When you do, let me in on it.
Why not?
I could never be a mother.
Well, sometimes talking's over-rated. Don't you think?
Agnes, did you love your mother?
She'd get angry.
Did you ever want to be a mother yourself?
Yes.
Do you believe she really saw them?
No.
Why not? Mmm?
No, but I can never tell her that.
Gosh. I hardly know what to say.
I loved the atmosphere. But it destroyed my poor mother.
Near the casino.
Now there's a coincidence. My father used to gamble there.
I was at a loose end. A friend of a friend gave me a courtesy membership.
No, no. I come every couple of years. I always think I'm going to stay. I'm from Cape Town originally
Hear, hear...
They'd die without each other.
Such as?
He started digging through my closet, something he never does.
I told him I bought the lingerie, as a surprise. I don't think he suspects anything, but now you know, if he mentions it.
I know.
Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case?
In any event, my feelings were hurt when I learned that he had fallen for someone else. Someone chaste... pure... innocent.
Found? I'm not some charity case.
What happens when he loves Rachel more than us?
Please stop now.
Do you want anything?
It isn't like this was the first place we were ever thrown out of.
Maybe she puts her work ahead of her personal appearance.
Who are you? How did you know who I am?
How was the game, honey?
He got hit by a bus.
Not much chance of that. Jaeger's an idiot.
THANK YOU.
And what are you? A cop?
Just cause I don't kiss her booty like you...
Bye, Robert.
Who did you talk to?
This conversation took place, incidentally, about three months before Harold was declared legally dead.
I see.
You're purposely making me talk while we do this... ...because you think this is good for me... ...and you're a sadistic bastard...
So she tells me three times a week.
People liked him.
I remember him watching me once. When I was little--before you and I--
I was on the playground with all the other kids, but I thought he was only looking at me. I was afraid he was going to arrest me--he had those eyes, you know--
I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way.
That's what I'm counting on.
You need to. She's alone in this house all day, taking care of Dad and your ungrateful behind.
No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody.
It is hoped that it's not a mess. "Hopefully" is an adverb. It means "with hope". You have it defining the copy, and I'm pretty sure the copy doesn't have feelings.
That was really bad, wasn't it?
Still looking.
No...
Who is she?
Uh, uh, this is great. I mean, I love e.e. cummings, but I can't let you get this.
Fine. Oh, we went to the Caravaggio exhibition at the Met. It's such a treat to go through a museum with Frederick. I mean...you learn so much. Do you like Caravaggio?
No, I don't think so.
Oh, no, I can't let you get me that. That's too much.
Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
Because I know you don't drive around for twelve hours.
You could keep it and rent it out?
Not if you don't want to.
It's so beautiful.
We do appreciate the way you have taken it upon yourself to meet the other patients.
I don't like thinking about the accident. I don't even remember it happening. Besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...
Why would you suppose so?
But the power...
Just do it!!
Bye.
Okay.
Bye.
Call me later.
I think you forgot this. Hands him his wallet and badge...
Yeah, we better.
How could I be so stupid? You'd think I would have learned by now -- when you're in love with a married man, you shouldn't wear mascara.
And just think -- right now there's some lucky girl in the building who's going to come after me --
Merry Christmas.
Yeah, well it's not everyday you get news like this. You're sure he's okay? Other than the bump on the head?
I think it's worse now.
Dad...
I'm sorry?
At the party.
Well, I mean there's nothing he wants to know about it... I've got to run.
You're --
Gee, um... I...I don't know what to say.
Well, you belong in one.
Stop it! Stop it! JACKIE covers her ears and looks at him, pleading with her eyes. STARKS' eyes plead right back.
You can't be William Starks. He's dead.
William Starks is dead... I've been to his grave.
I looked it up.
His body was found New Year's Day, 19...1993. At Alpine...
The man dealing faro. Who is he?
Is it over?
But I'm seeing him.
What are you going to do?
Are you using minoxidil?
Your hairline looks like it's receding.
Thanks. And what are -
Rob--thanks. For everything. This is really happening. I never thought--
You already pitched this to Rigfort?!
Rufus?
I wasn't doing business.
I think I might go inside and sit down for a few minutes.
It's all over between us. I've found someone else.
I'm sure that didn't upset her. Everyone in our family takes showers.
Sam, if she's here...
My son is out there!
I'll see you after the doctor has a look at your leg, Mr. Gardiner.
You'll be fine. Dr. Redfield just wants to give you some tests. You'll like him.
Not according to his teacher. It just got me thinking about Jason and what if Evan's inherited his father's condition?
That's why I wanted you to come here, Evan. Dr. Redfield already has a background in memory loss.
Mr. D. B. Norton!
In the minuet, George, every movement is significant, like the strut of cranes...
The word 'minuet' finds its source in minitus, which is Latin meaning 'small' or 'orderly'.
The wrong word, maybe. Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly.
But you're very private people. You know, there's a kind of elitism...
I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort.
I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating.
Well, yes. Yes, in fact. A little on the outside, yes. And there's been all this friction.
I guess... But you know... I'm American and I've mostly been taught to be competitive... There's always pleasure of being the best?
Wow, I actually feel like less of a fat dork now.
"Most Fruitful Yuki"? What is... Oh my god, she's a pregnant superhero!
Oh God, you're one of those guys...
Miss Johnson must be a real kindly lady.
I saw a man whose life was empty.
Who's Miss Johnson?
But who's gonna help me here with the house and in the field?
Well, I know this is really short notice, but I got a call from a very close friend at the Academy of Art Design and she tells me that I'm allowed to place one student from your graduating class in a one year scholarship program... and, well, I hope you don't mind, Enid, but I took the liberty of submitting your name.
Hmm.
As far as I know it includes housing and meals and everything... it is really quite an offer...
...wow...
Enid, can I talk to you for a minute?
Uh-oh.
Don't worry - it's nothing bad. I was just wondering what your plans were for next year?
I'm not really sure - working, I guess...
It had to come, I reckon, soon or later.
So what do you think?
I dunno... Would I have to take classes and stuff?
Awright, Tommy. What you figger you gonna do?
No... not in the eyes of the police.
And in your eyes?
I've already told you what I thought.
That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
It's possible isn't it?
Who?
One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
That's absurd!
That possibility never occurred to you?
Did you tell her?
Are you all right?
Don't know. No one said anything. ALEX Rendered speechless with desire. I recall that feeling, from the days when I had such a thing.
Hello. Hello.
How you doing?
Slowly or quickly?
Come home soon after the show.
-- did she talk to you?
He go back to the hotel?
I'm leaving, too.
I don't blame you!
Let's not get over-dramatic.
You've really got a low opinion of me, haven't you? We'll I'll give you some pleasant news. I've been told off in no uncertain terms all over town. Miss Channing should be happy to hear that. To know how loyal her friends are - how much more loyal they are than she had a right to expect me to be...
Do you expect me to believe that you didn't say any of those things - that they were all Addison?
No! I don't expect you to believe anything. Except that the responsibility is mine. And the disgrace.
- and you felt just like that talking to Addison.
In a way. You find yourself trying to say what you mean, but somehow the words change - and they become his words - and suddenly you're not saying what you mean, but what he means-
Why shouldn't you? Please sit down.
What do you want me to do, just step out in the alley? Is that it?
- and easy or not, I won't believe a word.
Do they?
Okay.
Why else would they be willing to put you under... ?
Finish what?
The librarian... or the library...?
What are you talking...
Could you do me a favour?
I don't want to wait for his call.
If you're asking me to sympathize with him, Brad, you're wasting your time. There's only one person I'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. That - that shabby little girl. I'm really sorry for her, Brad.
I would.
I don't know. Can we turn it off? I have such a headache.
That was easy. I read your books.
Don't be condescending.
It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
Madam, I am here. What is your will?
That's a good girl... I hate to see you so upset. Tell me, sweetheart. Are you having problems with Charlie? You mentioned something this morning.
What happened to you?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
There is no us, remember?
Well, she is getting on, but she's fine. I told her you weren't feeling well yesterday. She called to find out how you are.
Because I know you're full of shit.
Nobody's going to rush me into anything! You keep away from me!
And they's some coffee here. I could fix him a cup...
But I saw something...
So where does this lead ?
It's not nonsense.
But remember, darling -- I don't work before ten in the morning, and never after 4:30 in the afternoon.
The books themselves or maybe some pages he ripped out.
Ben! Oh my Ben! Are you alright?
Who the hell are you anyway ? What is this place ?
Oh, no.
What'd you wish, George?
Uh-huh.
Oh, no, George, don't. It's full of romance, that old place. I'd like to live in it.
That was sure swell ...
If I told you it might not come true.
How do you think.
Kind of.
Art.
Why are you asking me all this?
I was never much of a sweater. You know that.
Benjamin, what does it possibly matter?
I can't find Gregory. I've been trying to find him.
Jacqueline. Mr. Romari phoned me. She went out this afternoon with two men he'd never seen before.
I think so.
I think he'll find that satisfying.
Oh, you know what? I'm trying to convince him to produce a play.
He's fine.
Here, you guys. Open them up.
I like you, too.
I want to have children. It's just...
Good morning.
Forget it. I'm sure it sucks. All these movies suck.
This morning at Seymour's garage sale.
Ew ... when did you get that?
How about this?
Me... I... I... Please leave me alone.
I think about what I'm doing all the time, and I've got as much business behind the wheel of an automobile as anybody. Besides, I want you to stay and help Rose with the dishes, the poor girl isn't feeling well.
Okay.
I think she's gonna kiss him.
Yeah.
You'll read it in class tomorrow. Surprise me. Anyway, I have to go. I promised Melinda I'd help her with her oral.
Thank you.
Sure. What do you want me to call you?
Call me anything just don't call me late for dinner.
-- but since you're not going I guess none of this matters and I'll bring her anyway.
I'm trying to get you a girlfriend.
Yeah. And then it hits that little thing. That little punch bag. What is it? The tonsils. The esophagus, whatever.
Yeah. And you're not getting anything out of it.
Yeah. 'Cause they fucking shoot you in the eye, the face, the ear.
And sometimes it takes a long time, and you're fucking gagging.
And it's like. How much more can I bob here? You know.
You know what we should do? Let's go get in your car right now and just take off! We could just drive away and find some new place and start a whole new life... fuck everybody!
I used to think about one day not telling anybody and just taking off and going to some random place... Do you ever think about stuff like that?
It would have to be some totally average day when nobody was expecting it, and I'd just disappear and they'd never see me again.
Oh yeah... and Dana... You were a lot more fun before you met Dana. You've been acting way too normal lately... you're a bitter, twisted, fucked-up guy, Seymour, that's why I like you.
You know what my number one fantasy used to be?
Kristen got a quote?
Yes, urm, she's right. I have learned it is a very popular place for the young people to go.
I need the job.
Not with the right girl you wouldn't.
Yes...
It never did.
I knew the man 20 years. That's him. The way he walked... arms at his side, military, the stoop, the haircut, the twisted left hand, the large class ring. What was he doing there? If anyone had asked him, he'd probably say "protection" but I'll tell you I think he was giving some kind of "okay" signal to those hoboes - they're about to get booked and he's telling 'em it's gonna be okay, they're covered. And in fact they were - you never heard of them again.
Does it matter? Another technician. But an interesting thing - he was there that day in Dealey Plaza. You know how I know? That picture of yours. The hoboes... you never looked deep enough...
No thank you. I'm off sex.
Juno MacGuff.
Hi. I'm here for the big show?
I said, kneel!
Toby Tyler, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child.
I married him when I was 17. He was a cellist, and I thought he was the most brilliant man I'd ever met... And I'm sure he was, because at that age, I hadn't met that many... But he was insidious, you know. He had me convinced that I was a mediocrity, musically, as a woman, as an intellect. But in this completely imperceptible, pleasant way, so that you weren't even sure he was doing it. Anyway, I just woke up one morning and I said, you know something Joseph, you're full of beans, and I left him...
A new take on the... Well, sir, we're coming back, we'd like you to try it out, this evening...
A seminar in a baby breeding farm! Bodies in acid! You think I ll get anywhere with that? Jesus! With luck I might raise a laugh. They might even send a patrol car to check the place out. Whatever, it ll be too late.
Okay.
Good. That's very good.
Think they're alright?
How?
Are you worried about tomorrow night?
Have you been waiting long?
Yes -- of course -- all I'm saying is, this message was written in the language of science -- mathematics -- and was clearly intended to be received by scientists. If it had been religious in nature it should have taken the form of a burning bush, or a booming voice from the sky...
Considering today's standards of animal raising and curing meats, I don't fully understand the restriction on pork.
Aren't you going to say anything?
That you haven't time for either marriage or eating --
I see your point.
You are seeing it. You're looking right at it.
I'm going to go powder my nose.
Hello.
Did you see my father?
Don't. I know what you're going to say.
You love Emily. I know that. And you need to stay with her.
That's my brother's problem. He's passed out inside.
I think this place stinks.
He's dead, huh?
Drive down the block.
Benjamin -- I really do.
I do.
Yes.
Okay.
I flushed it down the toilet.
Why don't you get some rest?
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
There's got to be a flashlight.
You should be.
What's with you guys?
What are you talking about?
I used to tell myself. Talent is more erotic when it's wasted. Will I see you tonight?
It makes me so mad. Steven Schwimmer ready to strike. The exterminating angel.
It's your best play, Nicky.
He will absolutely hate it.
It's best not to get too close. Juliet's still not a hundred percent. Hello, Juliet! We've bought you some fruit.
So work with me, not against me. Okay?
Have you repaired the windows of the dormitories?
I mean, you're supposed to be backing me up, right?
I'm saving them for a rainy day.
What is it?
Draggin' the name of the Lord through the evil mud of his soul!
It's me, honey. It's Mom.
He lied!
Fun though, wasn't it?
Geez, they look kinda weird.
I stepped into a private trap back there -- and I want to go back and... try to pull myself out. Before it's too late for me, too.
Go sit over in that chair.
Shut your raggedy ass up and sit down.
Well, I ain't playin with you. I'm gonna unload both these motherfuckers, you don't do what I tell you. Understand what I'm saying?
I said, you understand what I'm saying
Yeah? No kidding. Listen, you still want to go girl hunting tonight?
I don't know, they didn't speak too good English.
I-you know, I don't wanna.
That movie makes me feel guilty.
Alvy, I...
M'm, I don't know, sometimes I ask myself how I'd stand up under torture.
To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing.
I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
I'm so burnt-out.
Well what?
It could have been any asshole with a couple hundred million in the bank.
Chris, please. Chris, I'm serious. I won't make it.
What check?
Oh, yes, the bonus.
Chris, I had to. I had to. I didn't think you'd react like this.
Chris --
...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her. His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him.
I'm so comfortable with that, Walt, I can't tell you...
If I tell you, will you arrest me?
No, no, don't talk to Immigration!
Too young or too old?
Do I look as funny as you do?
Beautiful.
Eighteen.
Well, why don't you say it?
No, I don't have the right. You're a news story!
Pittsburgh.
Years? There are going to be lots of... opportunities.
You did save my life! And it's me! I'd be taking advantage of you! I'm a reporter, John, an experienced professional... I...
I... I know that, John...
Mind if I use the bathroom?
I guess I do too.
I sometimes fade out.
You were going to get my door.
She still packing for her trip?
You splendid bastard...
Nothing to resolve, Ian. Let's get a drink.
I am fine... I gotta go. Goodbye.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm off the phone.
I'm upset, but I'm fine.
Mmmm, no. Not a good idea.
Let's see if they have an address for Becker. I also want to figure out more about the kid you helped her with.
You think Lorenson kills you?
Because that's the part I believe is true. You probably did help her somehow with the boy and Eugene's name did come up over and over again on the abstracts I pulled.
Ready?
Sure...
Yes, but how often? Tell me, are You happy?
Do you feel good about it?
Desperation has driven me past etiquette, all the way to frenzy.
-- you don't understand: it's more pain than before and the fucking morphine pills aren't working, he's -- past two days it's like he can't really swallow them and I don't know if they're going down -- I can't see inside his mouth anymore -- I'm up all night staring at him and I don't think the pills are going down and he moans and he hurts --
No, ma'am. No way. There's girls on the Rubber Rose who are political, but I don't share their views. I got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "Politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."
You're political, then?
I don't think I can wait until tomorrow. This needs clearing up.
Well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. The beatnicks were before my time, and I never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, clich s and the clap. But the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.
No, I'm afraid that part isn't true. Jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. We spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. Besides, I always travel alone.
Oh, I know about Sissy Hankshaw, all right. I've done a little hitchhiking myself. Ah shucks, that's like telling Annie Oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. I'd heard tales about you from people I'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. I heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and I heard how you were Jack Kerouac's girl friend...
How'd it go?
Cowgirls exist as an image. A fairly common image. The idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. Therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. Otherwise, they're being fooled. In the Rodeo Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City there are just two cowgirls. Two. And both of 'em are trick-riders. Trick-riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. Our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. That's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'
About being a cowgirl. What's it all about? When you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.
About...
Tell me about it.
Hello, Ted. You look well.
I'm not going to sleep with you. I will never, ever sleep with you. Never. Not ever.
Y'know, four years ago I was working in a bakery. Two years ago I was bringing Marty coffee and he didn't even know my name. I run that office now. Marty believed in me and I believe in him. You want me to just throw that away?
I don't know anything about it.
Do you know what you're asking me to do?
Hi.
We still talking? Look, I'm sorry about the other day --
We are only interested in two visas, Signor.
Someone stole my stuff.
I feel so close to you...
What the fuck did you do with my stuff?
You know how it is, Dad. He's sort of under Mother's thumb.
You are?
You're a little touchy about it.
Really? What have you been doing?
Is that so?
The big house?
If I didn't have a fianc in Chicago, I'd go for it.
Stacy, what are you waiting for? You're fifteen. I did it when I was thirteen. It's no huge thing. It's just sex. If you don't, one of the other girls will.
He was hot, wasn't he?
Oh cut the shit, Kathryn.
Excuse me?
I called them. If I was sitting next to a guy and I wanted to sit closer, I'd sit closer. If I wanted to kiss him, I'd just do it. You want Ron Johnson? Grab him.
I can't do that.
Kathryn, I know all about you and Sebastian.
Sebastian was a pathological liar. I wouldn't believe a word he -
Yes.
You are being ripped open.
Did you get a look at the stuff you destroyed?
Did he say why?
Tomorrow morning. Start hitch-hiking right away and...
Don't worry. They're not going to hurt you. Come on. Only show this to the driver. Nobody else. And don't lose it.
You're what?
Don't be afraid. Do what I told you and you'll be okay.
-- he's fucking dying, he's dying as we're sitting here and there isn't a fucking thing -- jesus, how can you tell me to calm down?
I'll set it up for tomorrow night. You'll meet me at his place at eleven o'clock... Don't drive there... Take a bus... Make sure no one follows you... His address is easy to remember... It's 2224 Deep Dell Place... It's a white stucco job on the south side of the street... I'll be upstairs with Andy... The back door will be open... That leads into the kitchen - go through the kitchen to the living room - there's a bar there... At eleven fifteen, I'll ask Andy to fix me a drink... When he does, you can crack him in the head... Okay?
That's his name... Andy. Our ticket out of here.
So, should I call Andy?
No, they don't say much. But Carolyn's 16. She's just about to find out about all this for herself -- she's going to fall in love, she's going to try and figure out how to build a life with someone. If I leave what does that say to her?
His family's lived for almost a hundred years. Richard doesn't know how to live anywhere else. And the kids...
For anyone. They'll never be able to live through the talk. Richard will never be able to. He doesn't deserve that. He hasn't hurt anyone in his life.
No matter how I keep turning it around in my mind -- it doesn't seem like the right thing.
That theatre -- half empty -- dancing for those few -- I was frantic -- I finished -- the last beat and... ...I waited -- I listened -- but the applause didn't come -- nothing. A man in the box -- and just the claques behind -- it is passed, Pimenov. We are dead -- it's finished.
Last night?... There was no applause.
It is not stage fright -- it's something more --
The performance -- the performance -- the performance.
...I don't....
So?
He can if He wants to. He can do anything, just like Inspector Gadget on TV. But I have to keep things ready for him, that's what I think. I've got his picture and I'm going to sit in his chair--
Yes. It's Asta's Christmas present.
So did we. I mean, Sherlock here.
MADISON!
And that is my last word on the matter.
Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already. He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock.
I was a little worried about the line of my throat. This woman has done wonders with it.
Does he love her?
He must like Shelly, I never saw him hit anyone in his life.
Anything? That's not even credible. If he wants to go up there? To check it out? I think you should encourage him. It's his life. But everybody's treating him like this -- valuable object. You're hurting your own case.
Let's get a drink.
People think I'm stepping out on Neil. We're causing quite a scandal.
You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind.
Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready.
I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here.
What'll we do out there?
What did he sound like on the phone?
No, thank you. It's my problem, too.
Mm-mm.
Harry? Harry, where are you?!
I called your god-damned office! I want you to kill him, Harry. You'll do that for me, won't you? I loved him, I loved him... that bastard.
I'm so tired I'm about to drive off the road. Keep me awake, willya?
Steve Slutes, and he's not a boy. Steve couldn't get arrested as an actor. He couldn't get arrested as a boy.
Detective Eckhart! I know! Welcome to Nightmute!
Actually...
I've seen some sickening shit. I don't blink twice anymore, especially in your case.
Because you're... different.
Let me ask you a question. Just a little one that's been gnawing at me for years.
On the bridge. How did you know that Tommy had your dog? That was no fucking hunch.
You're right, Evan, I don't believe you.
Yes!
No! He SHOULDN'T be here! It SHOULD'VE been a trick!
You are comin back, ain't ya?
She is just gonna cuss you up'n down.
Mama's gonna raise hell.
Llewelyn?
I'm used to lots of things, I work at Wal-Mart.
You better.
Yah, but -
Virgins?
He's right.
That was a red light!! I told you you have to stop at a red light!!
And how do you know that?
... both. Did I just see a man in a red suit and goggles?
The guy in the Halloween suit!
Would it be out of place to ask what he's doing?
You really believe all that?
If they ask you questions, and they probably will ask you questions, would you please say something nice about him mum? Help him?
It's still easier for you to understand suicide, isn't it.
Sir, you have no call to get snippy with me. I'm just doin' my job here.
We stood here once before.
Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd still tear into a guy I saw kicking a dog. Not that he is, by a long shot--
He isn't going to hurt enough as it is. She has to twist a knife in him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll turn my glamour on him," she says--
And to Don Quixote!
I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don Quixote's got the jump on all of us. I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to go through life wised up like you and me--
You deserve to die alone for what you've done.
Why do I always laugh at that?
No.
Okay.
I don't know. It's been a while.
...I can't remember.
Not a specific day. What's this about?
No, Odette says he's in shock.
He needs to be in a safe place. Have you heard from Mr. Garindi?
Now, now, don't let's be small about such matters. We won't keep books. Go on, unpack Mr. Gillis' things.
Goddamnit, they are out there, David --
David --
Then so be it. If you believe what that Indian said we were fucked either way.
Okay.
My... visions...
What?
Less neurotic. Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?
More confident, maybe.
All I'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. Otherwise, what's the use?
How? What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?
But you can't.
So many of them... despite what we did for them. Or maybe because of what we did to them. It doesn't matter. It's a perfect system now, isn't it?
We've never had a fight. Not a real one. But we're going to have one right now if you don't talk about it.
Because you're in trouble.
I'm not made of glass.
The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
Better not, or Early'd whip me.
Mmm?
Is this in any way unclear?
Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
Arnie, this is crazy.
Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess?
Well, these things take time.
I'm sure I don't know, Freddie.
That's not what's worryin' me. Why didn't she tell us? Maybe we could have done somethin' -- gone somewhere else -- puttin' a poor sick kid through this --
No, thanks. I hope we won't be a burden to them.
Looks like dirt.
Look,dirt!
And she saved it.
I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
Special effects?
I told you it was a long story.
Well, I don't know. We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting?
Shucks. And my autograph book is at the cleaners.
Who's left out there?
Where is she?
That's my Max.
Promise.
You got it.
You remember what the doctor tells us.
I don't think so.
No, please. I shall be absolutely fine. They pass Alm sy, who doesn't look up from his book.
Please call first.
No, Just riding bareback, that's all. Anyway, you might try the Oak Pass or Stone Canyon Reservoirs. Sometimes at lunch Hollis takes walks around them. Otherwise he'll be home by 6:30.
No. I went riding rather early.
It's very personal. It couldn't be more personal. Is this a business or an obsession with you?
Suppose they did. How does it concern you?
Not for long.
No argument. You can sleep on the sofa in the living room, or go home. It's up to you.
So I see.
Out.
I'm so cold.
I do it because I love you. Because everybody I loved you. Mommy -- wher- ever she is -- Susan, Quince, the people who work for you, everybody who's ever known you.
They respect you. Isn't that a kind of love?
light shining in her eyes Throw sea weeds into the flames, and the fire turns blue!
So you know we put the case before the arbitration panel, none of whom had any expertise. Superfund is just one of those words. People stop paying attention.
...Ray?
It's so frustrating.
Honey, your father knows the President.
Did you forget where I live? It's four o'clock.
And be careful in the sun. Your gray's in danger of turning a little pink.
The light was fading. Huh-huh.
I'm not a child... I have feelings... Don't you...don't, don't...don't...
No. I'll drive myself. I have a few errands. I'll meet you there.
What's his name?
Then who flushed the toilet?
Is Norbert still here?
It's true.
I know. I thought I'd never get those braces off.
Oh, sorry. With the light always on, it's hard to tell.
I will be the judge of that.
Here's one by a man that's very much alive.
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?
Folks come. Folks go.
If I call them, and they come what on earth am I going to say to them.
Stan... c'mon...
Hi.
Welcome, Howard.
Cole slaw, ice tea?
It's just... y'know... I mean...
I remember you were in trouble all the time.
My house.
I've got an idea.
Nooo. I just thought... l mean, I am looking for a new car. But I just thought, well, I'm going away soon, and you'll be stuck here and, I don't know, I just think maybe if things had been different we might have been, well, friends. Real friends. And then things would be different. Don't you think?
Doing what?
Yes?
Sure--
Maybe they just didn't know how to handle you.
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.
Yeah. Me too.
Don't say my name.
Or rank. But can you do me a favor and pull a transfer order?
"Wickwire, Thomas Dane." See what you can find.
Who signed as his "sponsoring officer"?
God!
You know, it's probably my fault. I've been a little depressed lately.
Stay out of this... Doctor?
My wife is Melvin Udall's publisher. She says I have to take great care of this guy because you're urgently needed back at work. What work do you do?
I'm a waitress.
No, I didn't. So why are you h...
Huh?
A man's worth can be judged by what he has or what he owes. Only the amount matters.
I'm only asking for one thing. And it's not an extravagance. It's not even for me; it's for our daughter.
Our child's safety is at stake.
How? Supportive letters from prison while I'm being kicked out of our home? Do you have any idea what is happening out here? Our credit cards are maxed. The people at the bank, you should see their faces when I walk in there. I have a letter from the government telling me that anything I sell from our house will be taken against an income tax lien. Our friends are behaving like the crowd at a public hanging. Nobody will help us. Nobody will take us in. Nobody wants anything to do with us. So tell me, Carl, how you're gonna make it up to me. Tell me again how we'll get through this, and maybe while you're at it you can put your hand up against the glass so we can have a tender moment of connection.
No, please go on.
Wait, wait. I'm trying to figure this out. This is like Rona Barrett. Before you become saved, God already knows who you are?
So it's already worked out. The fix is in?
Wow. Then why be good? Either you're saved or you ain't.
If I break one you gonna shoot me?
Uh-uh.
Neutron counter's not showing very much.
You like this? Walkin' me through this field like I's your mule?
Itches.
The magnetometer is pegged. Side-scan is showing a big return, but I don't see anything yet. Are you sure you got the depth right on this?
I bet! Actually he reminds me of that one creep you went out with -- you always go for guys with some lame, fake shtick.
What are you talking about -- who?
I want to do him!
Only the elders.
Yeah.
It was just great!
No.
I know, I know, and a first-aid kit and a fire extinguisher.
The fountain is the Caspian Sea and the Sea is serving up caviar. The 'B's for Beluga, the 'P' for Petrossian. Of course, they also stand for 'Bill' and for 'Parrish'.
-- Plus we've got a baritone with a balalaika coming from The Russian Tea Room. I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt and he'll sing Nelson Eddy songs.
...No...I don't hate you. Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
You feel like you want to be forgiven for your sins? Honey, you're not on your death bed, yet....this kinda talk's gonna get you in trouble --
No. No.
You're my handsome man.
No.
Would you like to be?
Martha Louise Livingston.
Are you married?
Anything.
What's your real name?
Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
Anything?
Samuel, it is not something we should skimp on. A bodyguard's presence in the car or outside the school was at least some form of deterrent. Now he's gone, I feel totally exposed.
Not at the moment, no.
Do you have any children?
Don't try to charm me, Charlie Bodell.
I came to say goodbye.
Well, I can't let you down now, can I?
Well, you don't know me, so... you don't know, do you?
Don't tell me don't tell me!
Told him what?
You... .
You can trust me. Is it Jack? It's not Jack, is it? It's Muddy ! Is it Muddy?
Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you?
No. It ain't Muddy. Muddy's just...
Honey, please.
Remember everybody, tonight, dinner in the city at Daddy's. You too, Drew. We've still got some loose ends --
You're only six-five once.
That's not the issue!! Ugh! How can you act so casual, when you're dressed like that?!
If all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.
Wyatt, what're you talkin' about?
Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal.
...My mother calls every week. Like a recurring nightmare. "So, have you met anyone?"..."No mom".. "So what's going to happen?"... "I don't know Mom"... I only thank God I moved out.
I can't believe you lived with her for that long. If I had to live with my mother, I'd stab myself six times.
Pearl dotes on him.
If ever I saw a Sign from Heaven!
That feller's just achin' to settle down with some nice woman and make a home for himself.
No? Not even one more?
What are your favorite buildings, David?
Oh, yeah.
Well, why don't you share them with us?
And you, I take it, are the Paderewski who plays his concerto on me, the piano? Where is Princess Fire-and-Music?
He wants to see your map.
He says he wants it now.
Mister Sefelt?
Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
But you have no proof.
Oh, you were in the band?
Yeah, he's told me. Burnfield. We all hear about Burnfield.
What are they?
Please, you jump in some guy's face, talk smack and you get a pat on your ass. But because I'm a female, I get told to calm down and act like a "lady". I'm a ballplayer, okay. A ball player.
Would you put some of your singing in this for the baby?
I'd like to...
What will you say about us?
It'll give you the different countries, how they came to be, what they are now, how America came to be, the governments, the languages... everything.
This is yours...
We can.
Why don't you call him?
You're sure this is a good idea.
I'll be down front. You better start putting your face on.
No problem. Do you want to come in?
Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life. You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next. And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it. Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer.
No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another. You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act. Well I'm out. I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here.
I've had it. No more wirehead shit in my car. You understand? You want to poach your lobes, do it somewhere else.
Anything, Auggie. Just name it.
Did you like it; me watching you?
Are you crazy?
For keeps?
When will his trial be?
....Hi.....
Can I write down my address and phone number for you?
Do you want to pick me up?
Ok.
Yeah.
Don't start --
Where the hell are you taking us anyway? Just blow something up already.
If you're going to slander him, then you don't deserve to hear his stories --
But
This is not your house, Doyle. This is my house and I'll say who stays and goes. You've got a house, why don't you go get one of your girlfriends and go home to it.
You're not stayin' here tonight. Go get sober before you come back. I'm tired of my child seein' this. Now you get yourself straight or I'll lock your ass out of my life for good.
Well, that-that's good. It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively...
Yeah, and for yours. I'm sure you've changed.
Oh, wow! I don't want to have this conversation. I didn't do anything wrong.
You don't think he'd want me within fifty miles, do you?--after the exhibition he saw me give! Did you see his face --?
What're you doing? What about the car?
Time?
How close are you?
Look, you can just punch into his little chip where you want him to go, and he goes, right?
He's got the shakes?
I haven't felt like it.
Daddy, I don't want to get into anything with you tonight. I'm tired and I...
I know I'm late and I'm sorry, but Mrs. Rufferwell asked us to help with the cleanup and...
Is what better? Better than what?
Jesus Christ, Rob. Is that really what's bothering you?
You really think it would make a difference either way?
I don't know what it is. It could be anything.
I heard you talking. You got fired this morning, didn't you?
What on earth is happening to you? Why are you acting this way?
You were busy? You know, I really was waiting for you to call me.
Dinner? Again?
Trust me, Violet.
I'm just asking, what if?
There is no going back.
I don't have a life, Bobby. I'm in love with a married man.
This conversation's over.
You're a moron, you know that?
What makes you think it's you?
Oh.
How the hell did you do that?
Where is he?
Who is this?
Forget it...
Yeah, we graduated high school -- how totally amazing.
Oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...
I know, she needs to die immediately.
Since when is she an "actress"?
What're you going to do?
The female.
But don't worry, I'm clean as a whistle. I only did S M. No blow jobs. No screwing.
All men are cheats.
...Aren't you skating?
And you never got the chance?
Oh, what, what do you do?
You made it.
A mass of music and fire. That's me. An old kazoo and some sparkles. Tell me - was Bill swept away, too, or were you too full of Revelation to notice?
I don't think so.
I know who you are, El Americano. Mister George.
What did you do?
What happened?
The doctors said to do everything the same as long as possible. I didn't want anyone being -- weird around me.
I'm sick.
It's always in the more gifted of the three.
Who? Robert Taylor?!
Better than not getting a job?
You got the job?!!
A lie. What do you hate most?
Whatever.
Benjamin -- I want you to know I'm available to you. If you won't sleep with me this time --
Sheriff Deeds' dead, honey--you just Sheriff junior.
That's me.
You ever play one of these?
I want to stay.
Please.
I want to go with you, Jake. Wherever you go.
This is one of my dreams, Jake. Ever since I was a little girl. I never thought it would happen.
Bullshit!
I can waitress. I'm good.
Maybe ...
Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. It's not a thing many people would understand.
Amado.
He hates me.
With Paloma, it's more like she pities and tolerates me- totally age- appropriate. But Amado--he's--he's never been book-smart. Had a hard time learning to read. Me being a teacher and caring about those things is like an embarrassment--like a betrayal.
Fernando wasn't pissed off at everybody. He just wanted to fix their cars.
So why did you come back here, Sam?
Look, I came here to get papers to travel to Paris and. . .
I have my reasons.
Look - there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . Look at me!
You will not tell. As you love me and as I love you, you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig!
Down the hall on the right. The door sticks. You have to really pull it.
Yes.
Thank you. I'll bet you need to --
You didn't need to do that. You just didn't.
I'll wait for you...I'm proud of you. I'll be waiting.
I'll knit you a sweater.
But I was with him the whole time.
He couldn't have.
Cal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you --
Is that the one who died?
Not to me.
But, Nathan--
Peter, what are you talking about? What malfunction? What day is this?
Wait -- hold on a minute --
Hello, Thomas, how do you feel?
It was we ourselves did that. And for my life to come I would not have it otherwise.
X...
It could help with a new car --
He goes to my father's church. He could've died --
I don't make small talk --
You realize you're nostalgic for an era you weren't even born in?
It's the truth. Those 17 superstars are our insurance policy. We can't open -- can't make a profit without them.
-- What's wrong with that?
-- I have a feeling you're going to tell me.
Taking one community college course on the history of Nicaragua, while barely holding a job packing boxes?
I want to know why you are the way you are!
You're not answering me.
Why are you ashamed?
Come on!!
I don't care.
Late, very late.
I'm too sleepy.
Of course. How am I gonna forgive him after what he did?!
I knew he wouldn't want to speak to me. That dick.
You still mad at him?
Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that?
We talked earlier about your mother. And we talked about your father and his death. And I don't want to be challenging or defeatist here, but I have to ask and I would want to clarify something -- something that I understand --
The King of England. I want to give them the chance to leave Orleans in peace before I get there.
Just what I said. That's what I --
That's the first time you've been right today. That's what I --
You bet I've got a better offer.
I know, Walter, but I --
I don't know why!
I'm gonna just get some girl stuff, like make-up and... stuff.
How do you do? I'm sorry we have to rush.
I thought you were an archer?
I also need someone who can read and write.
I just can't have any social life right now.
I just don't want it to get too heavy. I feel really overloaded. I have this theory of convergence, that good things always happen with bad things. But I know you have to deal with them at the same time, but I just, I mean I don't know why they have to happen at the same time, I mean, I don't know why, I just wish I could work out... Am I just babbling? Do you know what I mean?
Friends with potential.
Be friends?
Likes me? He said I looked like a grasshopper.
I do if you do.
Well, please excuse us! We...we haven't entertained a guest in...um...
What can I offer you, Eve?
What?
Oh okay.
We can't. The storm. The waves would toss us around worse than we got down here. And we have four days of decompression when we get up top.
So is our electoral process. But we still vote.
Bye, Dad.
That's enough, Yvonne!
Bruce ought to be back by now. Walter, you're not trying anything again, are you?
Sir? Right now?
I'm sorry, sir, I -
Oh, well, that was a long time ago.
Right.
Don't shoot me, I'm friendly. You can use that when you surrender.
Finish your breakfast...
Good-bye, Duff.
Father--oh.
Hi. I was worried I was early.
We're all going away.
But you're in the U.S. Army, how could you --
Whatever you're trying to tell me isn't good, is it. Or it wouldn't be so hard to say.
It surprises me that I'm not the only one on this balcony who feels that way.
You waited til tonight to tell me?
Never mind about that...
For Pete's sake, Norville!
What was that ?
He's on to a new thing. He's after a guy who owns a gun shop he says is "woefully and wantonly" selling assault rifles to minors. He says he's gonna take him down if it's the last thing he does.
I told him I might.
They've confiscated all his other stuff. But this one's sorta left over. The registration's in the glove box, the keys were under the seat... What's a matter, haven't you ever borrowed someone's car?
I didn't use you, Max.
I never lied to you.
That was eleven years ago.
Where's my name?
Oh my God.
Oh my God. I don't believe this is happening.
Just find him some clothes, Wilbur. He could use some clothes.
He'll need clothes... some money...
Oh, just stop it! You knew this was going to happen. He's a young man.
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
Are you sure? About me, I mean?
You said you couldn't kill anybody.
Nicholas! What are you doing up?
Jerk! You IDIOT!!!
Leave me alone!!
Oh no?!?!?!
I have a snoop.
No. The man whose money she... he talked so loud and fast, and I... I should've called the police.
Why not? Sam, is she hiding here? Are you two planning to go away with the money?
She haven't even called you?
Yes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me.
How do you feel about getting old?
Same way I been doin', but first they got to let me go back to work.
If I get let off. Otherwise, fuck 'em.
Jorge. You frightened me. What's happening to you?
Oh--
I'm not getting my period. Jesus, every time anything out of the ordinary happens, you think that I'm getting my period!
Apparently pretty high, we just got a new CEO last week.
Alright, alright, I'm in a bad mood, okay?
You're gonna hafta learn to deal with it.
Okay. Please, I have a headache, all right?
My voices... my voices... do you think they will ever come back?
Here it comes, poor Tom.
Yes - I have had it for years.
I love you too.
I'm so proud of you, Bud.
I'm not paying this back. I consider it "asshole tax."
Say you're sorry.
And, oh my God, that other thing, that pointing to your lap? What's that supposed to mean exactly? Does that mean pull over, I want to show you what a big fat slob I am or...
Does that mean suck my dick?
You got that right.
No. Not remotely. I just want to find out about him.
We had to work. My family was poor.
This certainly is an improvement on the motel an' the coffee shop. How could you have left such a beautiful place, Bobby?
I'll tell you the truth, I heard this guy on a call-in radio show and I might not marry the person I should marry because I've become obsessed with him.
... And those?
Oh, many things. Inertia ... Stalin and the Cold War... a failure of nerve. We took the seediest, most inefficient fifth of the economy into State care, paid out millions for it, put the same old duffers in charge. A new broom with very old bristles. When the Tories were returned, I went and sat in the BM and wrote my little book on Chartism.
Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Worried!
I don't think Mr. Rose would leave without you.
Yes.
Medallions.
Eight years, though. That's quite an accomplishment.
He has to find non-smoker's meetings that used to be almost impossible, you know? It's gotten much better.
Yes... why?
What a nose. You missed your calling.
You must've had a reason to ask me that.
Days??
No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time.
WATCH OUT FOR HER; SHE CAN GIVE YOU DREAMS.
You think so!? I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working. And that takes it's toll, you know.
Come on. At least no one's gonna see how bad you are.
You asked my name once; it's Madeleine.
"Well worth the dig!"
DADDY IS COMING FOR US.
I have plans.
Hi.
Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby.
I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you?
It all went so fast. He was out of his mind and then all of sudden there was this screwdriver. I only wanted to defend myself. You have to call the police...
What does old Stew want?
No, I didn't forget "sexy".
First push the man, then the issue. Senator Palantine is first of all a dynamic man, an intelligent, interesting, fascinating man.
I'm gonna get me a drink.
Sometimes I get a ride with my brother. But he usually works in the mornings, and then drives to school himself.
I can't wait until I can drive next year. I walk every day. It's such a drag.
We've not gonna get to the cabin till after dark as it is, Thelma.
I'll never make it... Can't we stop just for a few minutes...
I haven't seen a place like this since I left Texas.
What a coincidence. It happens to be my fetish too.
... I'm just so sick of feeling defensive about the things I care about! Or being lumped in with the lunatic fringe by people like Drumlin, when if they'd just put aside their preconceptions for two seconds and look at the facts...
It's like the pre-Copernicans who swore the sun revolved around the Earth, or the Victorians at the end of the last century who concluded that all major discoveries had now been made. I mean... try to imagine civilization a thousand years ahead of us -- then imagine trying to explain... I dunno, a microwave oven -- to someone even a hundred years ago -- I mean the basic concepts didn't exist...
'... is indistinguishable from magic.'
Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes.
Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love.
Yes, you do, you damn well do.
Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing.
Why?
No.
Goodness, no. From what you tell me about it, it certainly doesn't sound very attractive.
You see, it's not a dream.
Wake me up when you come to bed?
What?
Would you let me pass?
Don't do this.
Oh Michael.
That doesn't sound dark.
Couldn't we just stop at a seven- eleven?
Buddy. Well, now, that's a nice name, I like it. I am real pleased to meet you. Hey, look, do you think you got a cold drink of ice water somewhere?
I thought you'd never ask.
I know.
I'd love one, but not there.
It's ten o'clock in the morning --
So, sue me. Things have changed. I think you should go home -- and after you leave I see no reason for us to ever have contact again.
Oh.
Still afraid somebody may see us together?
No, Jeff. I can't stay very long. Can I have a frozen daiquiri?
What's it look like?
I understand you have suffered. I know... about your woman.
Peace is made is such ways.
Don't be silly...I'm old. Don't look at me like that, please. Why'd you come back?
Rosalie Testa!
No, I'm warning you! Who do you think you are, God? You bumble around with your folders... ...and your pencils... ...and your god-damn buttons... ...all your badges of authority! But you have no authority! You're nothing! You're a zero!
Symington says...
Dr. Symington, how big is your dick?
I want outta here, you understand? I'm ready to get out! So you go back there... you go back and you tell them to let me out!
'Cause if it's long enough, which I doubt, why don't you wrap it around and fuck yourself in the ass!
Yeah--I see I'm right where I've been for seven years--
And I'm an old hand at following instructions--
No?
Nice compliment !
Yeah? And what else?
When I saw you were gone I got scared.
What happened?
But he has nothing to do with it!
Look, I gotta get some sleep.
No, you're just trying to get off.
I want my money.
What's that?
Siesta.
Birdie-
Yeah... I will.
Okay.
I'll check with Eve...
I love you too. Good night, darling-
Yes. Whenever... all right, look. Whenever I see a man that I think is attractive, I wonder what it would be like with him, I mean, I'm just curious, I don't act on it, but I hate that I think that!! I wish I could just forget about that stuff!!
Don't worry about it. But as long as you've made us supper, we may as well eat it. Huh?
You shouldn't have bothered. I really don't have that much of an appetite.
I've caused you some trouble.
Want me to take 'em up and wash 'em good?
Just look at you! Dust and filth from top to toe!
Kramer...
You want to know why? I'll tell you why... Another scotch and soda for the gentleman. I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore. Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him.
O'Connor's out to get you. He's going to take the Fire and Ice account away from you.
You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home.
I don't know! I can't see them from here, Joel! Just pick something good.
You pick it.
Yeah? Well, have a seat, anyway.
Ready for another?
You have to hear this, I can never touch you, Ishmael. Not once, not ever. There's no half- way. As much as I know it hurts you, you have to let this go.
Well, why should I put you through all my moods and hang-ups anyway?
No, but... he sent me so many signs!
Yeah, my analyst thinks this move is keen for me.
Exactly, but... exactly. Ooooh!
What?
No bad dreams.
What will your father say?
Yes, he is. I'm sorry I didn't get to see him.
Billingsley's?
Your leg must be getting better.
Good. I'm glad to hear that. ... How did you like meeting the President?
And now, Chauncey, I'm afraid you must excuse me - I'm very tired all of a sudden.
Chauncey!
Who is it?
You mean John Bubber?
Fuck. Basher-Basher, this is Ground Crew Six requesting emergency extraction. Stand by for a PRC fix...
I'm lookin', I'm lookin'!
'Cool?
You cannot walk away from this. You cannot.
That's the rumor on the street.
I know ...
Long as it's fun.
Thank you. I wouldn't want to interrupt anything.
Maybe she's asleep.
Oh, yeah. "The Philosophy of Time Travel". What is this?
Buddy, I was horrible. I can't tell you who it was, but do you know what I did? I sat on his lap and got ahold of him and wiggled and wiggled my ass on him and was worse'n you could know, a child like you. Why, I let one of my tits fall out deliberate on purpose and practically smack him in the face with it and I let my dern skirt come up so he could see my drawers... But to get back serious to what I was sayin', it is not only, Buddy, the loss of him but my own bad behavior what bothers me so...
I thought I'd go crazy back there in that room all by myself with nobody to talk to. As a child, I never had no room all to myself, we were awful poor. Buddy... I have got a confession to make.
Bullshit.
I don't know... It's very strange not feeling that stupid panic thing inside you all the time. Without that you just start thinking about yourself -- and what does that ever get anybody. Today, on the bus there was this adorable couple and I felt myself giving them a dirty look -- I had no idea everything was...
Eight o'clock?
Now use it.
Yes.
Oh, Grady. You're such a putz.
No. You are a guest now. You go in the living room.
I'm on the last page. How do you spell conscience?
I'm going to the hen house. Are you coming with me?
We should go soon. If Dad catches us smoking down here, we're dead.
God, that's... this is ridiculous.
What are you doing?
I was standing up there and looking at all the people, and I felt like they didn't know me. I mean, maybe I shouldn't have taken all those courses out of school, because everybody thinks I... forget it.
Oh god, I don't need all these presents. I don't know any kid who got a car, I mean...
Everybody thinks I'm a priss.
Let's not tell our sad stories.
Yeah. It wasn't like my marriage to Roger was so great, even before -- Jerry?
I'm going to make you a nun's cake. It will make your mouth water.
That might be better than this.
Means you keep me using my head, and that's good!
YOU BURN IN BELL. You burn in hell and you deserve it -- YOU GET THE FUCK OUT.
I'M NOT YOUR BABY, I'M NOT YOUR GIRL. I'm not your fuckin' baby --
GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.
GET OUT.
You got me.
It's a good thing I didn't have that baby, isn't it?
No! That's not all there is to it! I love you, too--I know I do.
I grew up with Wally. I began my adult life with him.
Do you think I'm having a good time? Do you think I'm just teasing you? Do you think I know whether I want you or Wally?
I'm sorry, Daniel, but you have to admit it's pretty ironic that you of all people would be the first man ever polymerized. It's got to mean something.
Hi, it's me...
You have no one to blame but yourself.
What's that supposed to mean?
Victim my ass! You stole my security key and used it to break into my lab to do who knows what kind of damage! Maybe this is the end of the story and you finally got what you deserved!
What are you doing?
He never answers.
Because he put the lock on! Do you think I told him he could have a nose ring?! Why do you ask me everything you should ask him!? I don't know anything, anymore!
Last year. I drove my car up a tree. Nothing serious, this... ...a minor concussion. But the car looked bad. It could have been bad. I think it scared the hell out of Norman.
That he doesn't...see me, or, you know, that I'm...that's something's wrong...with me.
She has a pattern of getting involved with losers... Once she almost ran away with a human cannonball from the circus.
I need to know about him because... he's involved with my sister...
He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
Oh, hi.
Nothing. It got messed up.
What happened to your hair?
When they're stuck with a bunch a the old ones!
But I don't remember.
Big. Frederick, show him the oils.
Are you crazy? Unhand that woman! That's Amelia Earhart!
Tell them who I am! Tell them who I am!
Are you sure you're OK?
Do you like it?
Really, this is idiotic!
No, that's Thea's bed. Miss Wollsten's bed is in there.
How kind you are. It is so comforting to know that someone cares.
Would you care to explain what you're talking about?
Go away! Leave me alone.
I'm stifling, but it's so pretty. The Kirbys.
Come with us, daddy. Please come with us!
Yes, yes...
There, the guy... How did you do that, without even touching him? Without noise. It's like you put him away... How did you do it?
It's incredible! How did you do it?
Frederick's done this whole new series that I'm sure you would really love.
Oh, I guess you're busy, huh.
Something made this happen, Billy. Mr. Stephens is going to find out what it was.
It's cold.
Yes, sir.
I'm sorry, but no rawness is jumping off tonight.
Oh! Oh, no! I think I've done enough experimenting for one day. Congratulations, Cyril. You've convinced me that you're a philanderer of the very first order. I shall recommend you highly.
That's funny. I need to talk to you, too. Perhaps you could put some of these coats in the upstairs guest room, Professor Tripp.
It's a very good job--too good to pass up. I'll be handling funding for the whole... Look, I... ..."like" you a lot. And you... ..."like" me, okay? Maybe if it was a year from now, maybe things would be different...
I've been offered a job in Washington with H.E.W.
Sure plan to.
I'll be there.
You bet your life.
He'll eat potroast and like it.
I'm concerned about the driver of the rig.
The Clock People?
Then if you are Japanese, then why are you called the Chink?
Clockworks?
Siwash, huh?
How can I thank you? How can I repay you for this part? It's a...what a, thank you for this part. The first scene at the Old Mill...
I just want to sit here longer, I mean the feeling is powerful -- why's that?
Why not try it for a few weeks?
Tell me the God's honest truth -- are you leaving because of me? Because if you are...
It's not your fault, Rafe. The letter I wrote you, they --
It's not that I didn't mean everything I wrote. It's just that -- I thought you were dead. And now --
Uh, no, we're going to dinner... Is this the way to the pasture?
Sure. Does your daughter want to come inside?
Can I get you anything...coffee... tea...a little tequilla?
Pasture? Oh, that stretch of field near the hill? Yeah.
I think they call it a pasture.
Would you mind if I did? I'd like to talk to him.
There's coffee inside... I was just bringing this to Tom.
Did he kill Freddie?
Dad.
Yes, he is... Look, Bruce, we're taking that next train -- and when I say next train, this time I mean it!
The Criminal Courts Building.
No -- but I'm sure it'll be all right with Walter.
Well, the story's practically finished. I'll just go upstairs and send it over with a messenger.
Good morning, Madam.
A ring. I wanted a ring.
All of it. That he tried to rape me.
You want to.
This isn't working out.
What's Early been in jail for?
Mother Miriam was with you wasn't she?
Yes.
She took the baby in her arms?
Yes.
I don't remember.
Oh, don't do this!
Wasn't it!
You saw it all didn't you?
Yes.
My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once.
...SO...anybody special in your life?
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.
But because your department can't do an adequate job in detecting the miniscule number at large, it's a problem. Correct, Mr. Deckard?
Of course not.
Are you apprehensive?
For the responsibility of your power. Being a police bureaucrat, you've got more than your share.
Where did you find those?
Those are my letters!
You wanna dance?
And?
Melvin, pay me a compliment... I need one and quick... You have no idea how much what you said just hurt my feelings.
You can go with Eli. He's taking Samuel to school. But you'll have to hurry.
I think I'll have a coffee.
He's got 12 satellites up. He's got dishes on top of 21. He's building this -- mega-network for Skywire. Let's use it.
I'll be right back, I'm gonna go get a beer.
But still, you can't say CBS wouldn't love to break something like --
Daddy! Come on, a name.
You thought Stargher wanted to be caught.
How about getting married?
All right , then. After all, what's it to me? So they drop him out of a balloon. All I care is--I don't want to be around. See? Squeamish. See? That's what I am. No, sir. I don't have to take it. Won't be a party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. I'm through.
Diz--
Okay. You don't mind?
Sheriff Potter, please. I can't go to jail. I wanted no part of it.
What do you want?
You were right. There's a part of him that knows the truth. About what he did, about himself.
No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide nor hair of the man. You mean to say the boys haven't--?
Well, what do you know.
He doesn't gamble.
I'm gonna love winning this championship in your house.
What's up, Sidra.
We'll do this again! Maybe next week. Here's your hat. Could I wrap something up for you? Did you have a coat?
What?! I can't hear you!
What a day - what a heavenly day...
Stop rehearsing your column... Isn't it strange, Addison? I thought I'd be panic-stricken, want to run away or something. Instead, I can't wait for tonight to come. To come and go...
It'll be a night to remember. It'll bring to me everything I've ever wanted. The end of an old road - and the beginning of a new one...
Creasy...
My last bodyguard. He drove me to school in the morning and picked me up in the afternoon.
In between you can take Mom shopping and to lunch. Does that sound alright, Mr. Creasy?
That's 'Bird.' Emilio forgot to take him with when he left.
But, Mrs. Lowood, I can't just stay here not knowing what's happened to my sister. Maybe if I went to New York -- if I saw Mrs. Redi myself --
"Making pictures." I like that. You really love what you do, don't you?
You ought to write these stories down.
You can't get sushi anywhere in Japan after 2 o'clock. Did you know that?
Ok, well, travel safely. See you soon.
Sing a song of sixpence.
You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants.
If he does ...
You a handyman, Fergie?
I sincerely hope so.
-- but I don't believe it to be the truth.
Did you talk to him?
Hartford?
Yes. Now I talked to Sela and there's a guy, this Pakistani guy down in Hartford...
Did I?
Something was there. You saw it.
So when you sleepwalk, you go somewhere familiar?
Then what was it?
Mrs. Feur. She's alive. I met her. She's really sweet.
What?
Jody, she's alive.
Maybe get some younger actress for the part? Someone who'd look the part as well as play it?
Now you're quoting Addison. Or Eve.
That's what I mean.
I'm not going back to school.
Lloyd Richards, you are not to consider giving that contemptible little worm the part of "Cora."
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
It's a mighty good man would come out of his way to bring a word of cheer to a grieving widow!
Yah. Yah. Home a Paul Bunyan and Babe the Blue Ox.
You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
Yes ma'am.
I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
I miss her.
Yes ma'am.
I heard your mother took sick, that so?
Yes ma'am..
Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
That my brother, my husband and your Mr Friedman were linked, that much I had guessed. But that my husband had killed Leon? No.
Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
Ya think?
You have to meet Bess.
Just remember two things. First, the law is a living thing. It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes. But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while.
Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you. You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning.
Did you bring along something to read?
I don't think anybody can make Tom do anything he didn't want.
Annie, I'm not good at this kind of talk -- goes round and round a thing but never comes to it -- so let's just say what it is. When you first came here, I didn't like you and I was worried. Tom means a lot to me and this family. Don't go looking here for whatever you looking for. Don't make that man go through something it took him a long time to see his way clear out of the first time.
Nothing.
Four and twenty blackbirds...
Baked in a pie.
Upstairs? Chauncey, you're always involved in some sort of discussion...
It must be the punch, and it is stuffy in here -- I feel it a little myself. You're an angel, my dear - thank God there are still men like you around to give aid and comfort.
So you're not so smart after all. I want you to know--if it ever came to it-- I'd be willing to get an ovum from the Egg Bank. In fact, I'd rather use a donor egg-- --if it came to it.
What happened?
He could indeed, Mr Lombard. But had he done so I think he would have let us know about it.
Now you know why you re here, Mr Lombard. It might be difficult for someone like you to discern, but we are people of a certain standing.
No. And before you ask, no, he s not gay! He has had girlfriends, but nothing serious...
I don't know. Someplace called Elmo's. Look, I just wanted to tell you that I'm all right and I'm on my way home.
...Soon as he finishes his thesis.
...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries.
Not yet.
Okay, Lou-is.
... I feel like something's been spoiled now.
Ask Al Auf. Alm sy asks Al Auf in Arabic.
We'll find him. We'll be back and find him.
Does you mother still work?
What does she say about, "Seduce and Destroy."
Are you close?
Yes...
It will do just fine.
No, I don't belong here.
What, they ain't going forty miles into Choteau everytime they want a hamburger.
I guess they'll want feeding and all, out here all day long.
Well, that's just what we need on a cattle ranch -- a vegetarian from New York.
That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
That's Vaughan. He talked to you at the hospital.
When I first met Vaughan, he was a specialist in international computerized traffic systems. I don't know what he is now.
And it was the last. Hasn't written a letter since. Not even a birthday card.
They'd gone.
Well, for your child's sake, show some decency then, rise above your sleazy instincts. You may have already killed him!
I could deny I had those credit cards on the plane with me, LaPlante...
Alright?
Hey, let's introduce the brand new you to Hollywood. We haven't seen the roof garden yet.
You happy, baby?
-- and who says I like Marvin Gaye, anyway?
It's not like saying that at all, actually, Rob. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye make pop records --
What are you still wearing that for?
I haven't worn mine in months.
I think I'm way ahead of them.
Mom, is there any coffee left?
Well if I don't who will?
It's just carpet.
You're not at the center.
...are you going to trade all night again? You got to go to work in a couple of hours.
I wonder if I can get a cell with a view of the gardens?
No. No...Pentagon says, Army's got'em, they got'm in ..."Custody"...
Yes.
What are you doing?
What about holding your right arm up like that all the time?
Yeah.
Get all of me. Take everything.
You're mad at him, take it out on me, take your revenge on me! Take everything, leave nothing for him to marry! Hollow me out so there's nothing left but the skin over my bones. Suck me dry!
I want to cut you open and crawl inside of you. I want you to swallow me.
No-no-no...
Only in bad weather.
Yes, Addison.
You're bleeding pretty bad there.
I hope you tell her it was your idea...
Hi. She's auditioning for a television commercial. She said she's gonna be a little late.
Oh, yeah? How's she doing?
Hi. Where's Holly?
'Cause whatever can go wrong, will...?
Really?
When?
You shut up. Who do you think you are?
...Don't get all...
Bottom, left, right. I have it.
Rob, you don't know how it was for me back in high school. No one ever threw juice boxes at you in the hallway. You never dreamed about being popular- you already were. All I wanted was to be accepted, and they just fucking tortured me. I can't do all that again. I can't go back to Southglen South.
I can't do this.
Gus insists that I become friends with these kids. The popular kids. It's impossible.
Good.
A Fiddlehead Sauvignon Blanc.
Yeah.
Sure.
For what?
The same guy who put me in, thanks a lot.
Yeah, yeah, I got the rest.
Okay?
After he got his divorce, he forced me to marry him...but when I saw her body, I swore to her on my soul that some day I'd get Jake for what he did to her...
You're sick too...he loved to do things to me. Control me. My Mom...it tore her up cause she couldn't do nothing about it. She become alcoholic...and the funny thing is-- I liked it. I liked being controlled by Jake. The truth was as far out and crazy as he got, I wanted more. I wanted to go all the way. Women say they don't want to be taken like, really taken -- that's bullshit -- they do. The first time he finished with me, he said I was a woman now. I was 14. Then he started crying like a baby...wanted me to hold him. It's a strange feeling to hate someone so much for so many years, but still want to hold him, comfort him... They found my Mom right down there at the bottom of Apache Leap. She had cactus needles stuck all over her body and Virgil...Sheriff Potter said she was drunk and went insane. But I'll never believe she ran off that cliff by accident. She was born on this earth and she loved it. She was like me. She just wanted to fly away.
He was a Shaman...in the mine. We had nothin' after he died. Jake took us in, gave us a little money. He used to call me his "little halfbreed"... He kept Mom on the side y'know, cause he was married someplace else. He had kids in Phoenix I think, no one knew him around here...but the thing was...you see... ...he was raping me the whole time...for years. He loved to do things to me. Believe it or not, he used to say he was in love with my ass. Y'ever been in love with a woman's ass?
Uh, what are those boxes?
I'm sorry, darling, have you seen my coffee mug...?
Oh, why-uh... y-y-you gotta car?
Oh, yeah? So do you. Oh, God, whatta- whatta dumb thing to say, right? I mean, you say it, "You play well," and right away... I have to say well. Oh, oh... God, Annie. Well... oh, well... la-de-da, la-de- da, la-la.
Well, bye. She laughs and backs up slowly toward the door.
Did you see him?
He'd go to a movie. I think that's what he'd do. If I were sure he was in a movie, I could stop worrying. We could have him paged.
It's a jungle out there.
He's not your son.
Is he all right?
Who else were you expecting?
It's just me.
I am mad at you! And at Landon! And the universe! And God! I don't even know where to put all my anger.
No you didn't. But he did change. Just not enough.
Your kids never cry.
Landon --
...And it's very important when you sit down never to point the soles of your shoes at anyone. It's considered offensive.
Yes.
About how fast was I going?
Am I in trouble?
In the back?
All that time I waited to go on a cruise, and you went without me.
What's that?
I'm going to stretch my legs
Why are you smiling?
No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
Beating you away.
Yeah.
Yes.
I mean, it's jammed. If we went... um...
Well, sometimes, some, uh...
Great.
I'm on the brink of bankruptcy; my husband's resources are all but exhausted. And to what end, I ask you?
It's a hard day's wages, slaving away for madmen. What I've seen in life, it takes a lot to hold my interest.
Ow!
I put myself in his stories. I play the parts. Each strumpet, each murderess.
It'll be fine when we get done with it.
That's Bessie Hall. Barney works at the mill.
Why did you contact us?
But you're so... I mean how could you possibly...? When I was unconscious. You... downloaded... my thoughts, my memories, even... This beach. I've never been here but I remember... it's how I always imagined... Pensacola.
Can you show me?
You'd better. I'm very angry.
Oh, yah, but there's not a heckuva lot to discuss. What about you, Mike? Are you married - you have kids?
Oh, yah, a long time ago.
Oh...well, you-you're not interested in this.
Yeah, right... Believe me, at this point I'm over the fact that every single guy likes you better than me!
You're just jealous.
That's not true, I just hate all these obnoxious, extroverted, pseudo- bohemian losers! Sometimes I think I act so weird because I'm crazy from sexual frustration.
Face it, you hate every single boy on the face of the earth!
I don't know. It's incredible to think that anyone could be capable of doing that -- but if anyone could it would be Rebecca.
He did. Look, I know you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink -- but you hold a pail of water in front of an old horse for long enough -- and well...
...maybe we should be lesbos...
Andrew was a kind and gentle man, but he was thirty years older than her. Where's the attraction to sleep with someone like that -- to have the kind of sex they had.
I really don't know her that well. We would say hello to each other when I would come to the house, but that was about it.
Robert, Grace isn't adjusting to school. And she can't sit in this apartment all day... I think it would be good for her.
Then...I'd like to go...What do you want to do?
Good bye.
What is it? Did you forget something?
You wanna go on a date with me?
Well...is that illegal?
It was on my bed when I came in. Can you just...?
I didn't know your family knew Johnny Fontane.
I used to come down to New York whenever he sang at the Capitol and scream my head off.
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
Nothing? Then it must be very boring for you here.
He didn't come!
Well, there's fishing and boating. There's concerts on the mainland and... but I feel silly telling you. This is really your home. You probably know better than I what there is to do.
I think that's ageism, and that's, that's being prejudiced against people because they're old. Maybe their mouths don't work as well as yours.
I don't know. Let me give it some thought.
I know you think my job is strange. You don't like old people, do you?
Okay, bye.
I'm going to miss you.
Don't be silly... Nobody's too old to learn.
Why not? You went farther than that last time.
I want you to go back to the hotel now. I'll call you a cab.
Uh-huh. Adam?
Sing it to me.
Adam...dumb question, but humor me. Have you ever had sex before?
You going out?
What the bloody hell do you think you're at?
My father never laid a hand on me. It's like the prick saved it all up for Tommy.
It's my fault. I should have told you he was released a few weeks ago.
It's not his fault, Evan. You knew how bad he had it when we were kids.
Please, Evan. Don't even joke. He wouldn't hurt you. He's just trying to scare you away from me.
Craps all over everything and everyone and then wants mommy to forgive him.
She was there...
And when the fog lifted, there's Darren with his head under Justine's skirt.
Come and dance with me, Mr. Kringelein.
Hello!
Presently, Mr. Preysing.
Let's not start all over again, Charlie. We've said everything that can be said.
Susan, don't go! Susan, please!
Goodbye, Charlie.
Don't go, Susan.
I won't let you go.
You can't stop me.
Don't you realize that everybody here is going to know about this? That you've packed your bags and ordered the car and -
- And left? Of course they'll hear. I'm not saying goodbye - except to you - but I never imagined that people wouldn't know.
My, my, what a coil we're in! What's this all about?
Daddy, it's true.
No, I didn't.
You mean you didn't. It seems to me the least you could do. You can't just jump at conclusions that way. You're being unfair.
Yes. Now run along like a good boy and see that you wash up properly.
What do you mean, different?
In the sub. Resetting the timer. Why?
In a lake.
That dog woke me. I lay there for a while, then decided to get up.
Yes, I just found it on the step.
It's okay.
Benjamin, is this your first time?
You use your sleeve.
Would this be easier for you in the dark?
You what?
Benjamin -- do you find me undesirable?
Are you afraid of me?
Hi, Harry. Did you see the play?
What did you do with the rest?
Tell him I want to give him his money.
I can't! I haven't got it!
Get Ordell to come to your office.
Uh-huh.
That's why A.T.F.'s gotta make the case. I'm their witness. They wouldn't have a case without me. If it's his word against mine, who are they gonna believe?
It never was, so I'm not gonna start worrying about it now. Look, Ray more or less believes my story, and he more or less doesn't care. All he really gives a shit about is getting Ordell.
Hello .... give me .... Well .... ?
You're going to return every cent of it!
I'll give it back to you .... all I've got ....twenty-five thousand...
What is it, Gilbert? Tell mother! What did he say?
Okay.
Uh-huh.
It wasn't my fault. I was just part of a team. I was doing my job...
Have you ever wanted to go to The Court?
You look in his citation book?
No, no, I just wanna get Norm some night crawlers.
Heck, yah. Ya think, is Dave open yet?
Martin, what-
I'm not sure I agree with you a hunnert percent on your policework, there, Lou.
Well, I was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...
How dare you? My father is the British Museum's most respected archeologist!
You got it.
Nigel, can't you see he's using you?
It's 3 27 hundred
Hmm.
My fault? ... Oh, Jabez -- all I want is to be proud of him. He can be such a fine boy, if we show him how to be.
Well, you're married.
So what?
Yeah?
I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God.
Argon's private lab.
Please, Ryan.
Then what is it?
The tip is, anyhow. I like to work on your hair.
Thank you.
And don't ever try to see me again.
Argon is a lunatic! I can't believe I was stupid enough to believe I could control him. You heard what he said, Nigel. He doesn't care if all of Calumet City is turned to Jell-O. How can that not affect you?
The boys at school don't think I am.
Yeah?
That's my diet shit.
He would have. You were his best friend. A better friend than me.
What?
Look, that shit ain't mine.
You planted that shit on me.
Is that what Argon told you?
You know what I mean, you don't even know him!
You couldn't do it, period.
That doesn't mean you do. You can't possibly trust him, he's... perverted.
Huh? Oh, yeah.
Oh, right.
Huh?
I can't believe you did that!!
Don't be funny.
I mean, I couldn't do that in front of John, even.
Why?
I took the bandage off yesterday.
Bruise? Oh, yes. It's better.
It's a shame there aren't more men in the world like you.
Would you like a drink?
Well, she was already dead, darling, wasn't she, so I suppose --
I'll go.
I wanted you to ask back there. You know, before you got us lost.
I thought Steve had talked to you?
He talked about Demons, huh?
Well, don't ever start up on 'em, cause once you do you can't stop. I tell myself I'm gonna play just three little games after breakfast, and here I sit with half the day gone.
Please! You can't get mixed up in this.
You can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. Then you start to feel...unlucky.
Would I get paid?
Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they wearing now?
I won't say nothing bad about the man, but you can ask away.
I've seen all that a hundred times.
Zack, I don't know if I want to do that...
When I'm good and ready.
I've never seen anyone handle the media as well as you, Chauncey. You're so cool and detached - almost as if you were born to it.
Chauncey, this is Mr. Dennis Watson of the State Department.
Well? Tell us! How'd it go?
Look at that place. It's creepy.
I can't move any smaller.
Tell me about it.
... I needed that.
Don't apologize, please. I can't stand women who apologize for wanting sex.
I wanted to apologize.
Look, I don't think this is a good idea.
I had to see you.
Yes-- It was on a Friday. I remember because I was going to visit my sister for her birthday. It would be October twenty-eighth.
What other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?
Horrible. He was tired and pale.
Jackie Shawn.
I'm nearly out.
That's George.
Well, don't they?
You don't get another swallow 'til you really open up.
How long has he been dead?
I do worry about Susan. Have you known her long? She hasn't mentioned you.
I tried to call, but apparently there's something wrong...
I'm glad you and the General didn't have to leave us. We would feel quite deserted..
Jesus, what a rude person...
So, how's it going today?
Dr. Bronfman's line. Yes. One moment please. Lila.
Honey, can we talk tonight? You know, about stuff? Things have been so strained for the past three weeks, since you know, and I just want to talk.
Get away --
Come on, it works.
You have issues. I mean you have some serious issues that need to be ironed out.
No.
We can make this work, Adam! Believe me! I'm very good at making things work!
No, that's really it. Thank you for answering my question.
That's it! That's the reason!
Where you been?
You say it just to calm me!
I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in?
I didn't used to be afraid of it.
Do you know what that is?
Not my wife - not either of them.
He was dead... That's a poem. Do you know what it means?
Persia. It belonged to a king.
Someone gave it to you? Where was this old house?
On the back street a green house
Geez. Well - geez. That's a suprise.
Why would you get bent if I asked?
Oh, lots of times.
Did your wishes ever come true?
Sometimes.
I made a wish today, and it came true just like Edward said it would.
Where did you get this ring?
That's what I wished on. Edward says it's a wishing ring -- and it is!
But where did you get it, Amy?
At the old house with the voice.
Guy or girl?
What is this? Who did this?
NO, YOU HAVE TO KILL ME.
Exactly what I said. I'd trust him before I'd trust you. How much clearer can I be?
No.
Hung up.
It won't. I trust him.
...No. Why was it.
So why does it bother you to talk about it... Chinatown...
Hold still. Why?
Boy oh boy, you're a mess.
I had to be, I only have five days. So just point me in the right direction and....
Sounds like you're very organized.
He always just picked it up at my place. But with A.T.F. involved, I want to stage it. You know, make it look more intriguing, like we know what the fuck we're doin'. Then it's up to Ray Nicolet, the A.T.F. guy to follow the shopping bag.
They seem to like the idea.
Yea, but I'm going to dress it up. Put the money in a shopping bag and hand it to someone I meet here.
How old's Annette?
I go back to work tomorrow.
Keep your voice down.
Patience, Willow.
I don't want it now.
You did.
Of course I love him. I always will. I'm just not in love with him any more.
Get out of here! Get out! Get out!
Think again!
Why don't you people let me alone? I'm minding my own business. You mind yours.
This is, look: Go you Huskies. ...what I see you saying, is: you have the two elements, Fire and Water. The Firehouse, and the Old Mill...Do you know, you could...
He talked to me today. Told me to keep my mouth shut or I'd get everybody in trouble.
I'm not hungry. You two just enjoy yourselves. After all, this is a celebration.
Mama...
Thanks, Dad.
I didn't have much to do with it.
Yeah, I suppose... Dad, who's Harry York?
... only for one day and we'll be back tomorrow night.
Of course I'm sure.
For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
Yes. He never forgave him for it.
Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
Deserts you? Harry said he'd take over for me.
Old?! Come look at this! She has wounds. Wounds on her head. Like thrashes. Or bites.
No, thank you, really, Mrs. Pilletti.
It's a very sad business, I tell you. A woman, fifty-six years old, all her life, she had her own home. Now she's just an old lady, sleeping on her daughter-in-law's couch. It's a curse to be a mother, I tell you. Your children grow up and then what is left for you to do? What is a mother's life but her children? It is a very cruel thing when your son has no place for you in his home.
Oh, sure. Siddown, siddown. Marty, tell her siddown.
Did you offer the young lady some fruit?
Well, siddown a minute. I just come inna house. I'll take off my coat. Siddown a minute.
Oh, it's a sad business. My sister, Catherine, she don't get along with her daughter-in-law, so she's gonna come live with us.
We could live it up and --
Blackjack, Nick, blackjack I am good at. I mean, they'd give us some free games or something, wouldn't they? Since you worked there?
And the slots, slots I'm good at too. Wouldn't that be fun?
I ask only one thing... to hear me in confession...
Time is running out.
Well actually I was born in Siberia and then they shot her and sent me home to my Dad.
Get the hell out of here.''!
Take your filthy paws off him -you ignorant pig!
Well, are you coming in or aren't you?
Are you going to preach now? Are we going to have a sermon?
What about the other boys--Do you think they'll go to the police?
Why should you be the only one.
No!
No. Because the bus went off the road. And crashed.
Yes. I do now. Now that I'm telling it.
I remember the bus swerved, it just suddenly swerved to the right, and it hit the guardrail and the snowbank on the side of the road, and then it went over the embankment there, and everyone was screaming and everything. And that's all. I guess I was unconscious after that. That's all. Then I was in the hospital.
It's too late. Argon injected it.
Oh shit, the meltdown. It's spread to the tower.
You don't have to say anything, Daniel. I'm a scientist. I know what's happening. I recognize the classic symptoms. Dizziness, shortness of breath, sweating palms... I can feel my adrenals secreting, my parasympathetic nervous system quivering, the estradiol coursing through my entire body...
Yes.
You live in the neighborhood?
No, well...I've been trying to write.
Bring something to drink.
Well?
You know, if there's one thing -- I just don't understand you, not one single little bit. You love me?
What 'business'?
Mr. Powell! Willa has run away!
It's very good.
She took out some time durin' the night, -- in that old Model-T --
Poor man. We were knocking on that door for ever. I think I've broken my strap.
Did Dickie's Dad go?
When did you start smoking?
What about a loan? You could go to the bank...?
Well, there's got to be a way...
You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening...
Nine hundred...
This thing was the size of my fist, Peter!! That's off the charts!
Not as long as the cigars and brandy hold out.
Cal insist on lugging this thing everywhere.
A diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean.
I believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing.
I needed to think. It was either this or the weather channel.
Buddy, I have to ask you, as bad as I've been please have pity on me and don't ruin me by telling them what I did. I know it was bad, it was bad and dumb. But mostly it was dumb, I didn't mean you no harm, I'd never want to hurt a hair on your head and that's the truth. I love you. But they'd think I did, they'd think I was awful, they'd despise me and hate me...
I saw it... him. But I got away. And I took the box. And I solved it. And they came.
The Cenobites.
It's Jennie. Just tell me if Telly is there.
Need any company?
Want a blow job?
Prude.
Where are you going?
Catching up on his reading. Asked about you, sends his thanks.
Forget it -- he'll come down.
Aren't you going to answer it?
Are you sent by God?
What?
Who is this?
You want to find them.
I can see that. What are they?
What are these?
Oh, Kurt!
Kurt!
Donna. On this tape it says "Donna".
The lawn -- it looks like it goes on forever, doesn't it?
We're friends.
-- well, if you feel like playing, go play...
From what?
Now, let's get down to particulars. How big is this thing? Where is it to be? How many boys will it take care of? If they're going to buy it-- how do they make their contributions? Your Bill has to have all that in it--
Try sitting down.
On paper?
I'm -- I'm fine.
Bavmorda cannot transform you. I've protected this camp with a spell.
Loads of ice-cream by Vada Sultenfuss I like ice-cream a whole lot, It tastes good when days are hot, On a cone or in a dish, This would be my only wish, Vanilla, chocolate or rocky road, Even with pie a la mode.
Look, Duff - if you're free, I'm not working tomorrow.
That's the way he is.
What d'you mean?
Billy loved to see his kids in the bus. They always sat in the back, so they could wave to each other. It comforted him.
It's not funny! I mean what am I gonna do? Without that yearbook I'm lost. I can't just walk around town looking for someone with a Wilson High School Letter sweater!!!
Hi.
Can I come? I'll start a fire...
Okay.
I want you to know that it's your final decision if we should continue or not.
Hey, Mike?
Why don't you take off your clothes, Mike?
How about both of us at the same time?
I think we're making a lot of noise.
I know. Will you please leave now?
If he had been under your prick you'd have spotted him for sure.
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus, I don't need people to tell me what I should do. I've just been thinking about things, that's all.
Who?
I don't know.
No! Why would I want to kill him?
Didn't you forget something?
What the hell is this all about?
I don't know. I mean yes, probably.
What are you saying?
I don't know what you're talking about. This is the most insane... the craziest thing I ever...
...no...
What's that?
And, yet, a chain of events has started. A chain that will lead inexorably to his death.
I've been going to some of the schools, looking for work, but the conditions here are... horrible.
I know this woman. She works in admissions at Lakeshore Community? She might be able to get you in for the Fall semester. Maybe she could get you the baseball scholarship, and I could help and--
We love her, Craig. I'm sorry.
Yes.
Well, you have the Maxine action figure to play with.
Me and John.
I'm sorry. That was nasty.
I'm not looking to just survive. I've been doing that all my life.
That's really what we all need, right? Someone to sit up on the wall with us--
I been thinking about how much I hate you.
Nope.
Is that legal?
Monday.
So he started having affairs, and you got depressed.
Wouldn't we all.
Oh, it's not so bad. I have two wonderful kids, my own business. Still, knowing what I know now, if I had the chance to do it all over again, I'd sure do things a lot differently.
Early! Stop!!
The public decides who's on that list.
It's Cecile.
They took care of that, thank you, Henry.
Well, her people were very poor. She says she was often hungry as a child, and I'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.
Deathly afraid of it. Her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.
No, you can tell me straight. It's okay. Just, you know, tell me what you think.
Here.
It relaxes me.
Well, have you ever made love high?
What? Hey, listen, what-what do you think? Do you think we should, uh, go to that-that party in Southampton tonight?
All the guys I've ever been with... they never want to know me. Who I am on the inside. They just want to qet inside. When they do, they think that means they know who I am. That I trust them. That they know me. That there's nothing left to learn. A guy like you, Nick -- six months before you can even touch my face. I figure a guy in that kind of bind, he's gonna hafta work to get to know me some other way.
I told you, Nick. Remember?
Yes it was all you --
Not bad. Just regular. You wrote me wonderful things, Nick. Personal things.
I'm talking about the heart, Nick. I'm not talking about the words.
Oh, yeah...
I want to learn to read it.
I'm good at languages.
The only card we have to play is the tape. You know, we get it to the media somehow...
I can't... I just don't know how to...
How come Karl won't eat here with us?
He does make some funny noises.
Why should I stay here, Jeff? So we can sit on the corner and watch the lights change, while you bitch about Burnfield?
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy
At sea, then--a voyage to a new world? she lands upon a vast and empty shore. She is brought to the duke Orsino.
An excellent beginning Let him be a duke. And your heroine?
If my hurt is to be that you will write no more, then I shall be the sorrier.
The Queen commands a comedy, Will for Twelfth Night.
My goal is to make art.
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.
Oh yeah. I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, huh?
Charisma?
You know, Royce, I got enough heat on me without you turning up the jets, too.
I feel like there's men here, there's women here -- then there's men. But hey, what'd I expect?
Me? Why me?
Well, he's not president anymore, so why be petty.
Look if the truth is you don't feel like talking about this right now that's fine. But don't look me in the eye with a big smile on your face and lie to me. Cause there are only so many lies you're allowed to tell before it starts showing on your face. You wind up looking like...
I'm not upset. Why would I be upset?
Maybe you're upset that Rachel moved in.
Well you're telling your teachers and your friends --
I don't want that to happen. Why would I want that to happen?
Well Daddy and I were thinking that sometimes people tell a story about what they wish would happen.
I didn't say that. Why would I say that?
Good night. Tell me that you love me.
Annabelle showed me the new dress. She's amazing in it.
But I'll tell you something, what I said in their, still goes. You and your family have been through a lot in the last two days... Not to mention what happened to you all seven months ago.
Oh, you can just set up on the dining table. I have to rearrange my shelves tomorrow.
Where does this go, Diane?
Hi...do you work with my Aunt?
No ..........I.
Oh my god. I'm sorry. I'll let you get back to that. I'm going to get unpacked.
Are you okay?
What are you doing here?
No, wait, it just goes... "he said he liked to do-"...
What matters to me is whether you understand it.
Why didn't you?
You don't expect me to believe that for one minute, do you? Does it matter what's on them? Really? ... Murder, Dick? Sex? Your secrets, your fantasies? Or just me and you and ...
For managing the truth. But the truth won't be managed, sir. It stops being the truth the moment you try.
... Another question I would ask would be a very simple one. How did you do it? How did you evolve as far as you have and not destroy yourselves?
How do you mean?
You kill me, you really do. The first truly global, a-political event in history and you can't wait to spin it.
I guess I'd say I trust us enough to believe our response would be something to the effect of, thanks for the advice, but no thanks. But to dilute or censor the truth, for whatever reason --
Oh, please.
Will you cut it out! Get ready, we're already late.
She's downstairs with Ruth. Get ready.
Bullshit. These are classy customers. You can't show up all fucked up with a Fila running suit on.
Exactly...
Bobo won't be. He'll spend the money to make sure.
She must have been the one that blew me off with Bobo. I guess to get me running. Did you tell her about my stash?
No, you wouldn't. That's what she was after, though. But why hit on me?
As though you do what I say.
Shit! Oh shit!
I didn't want to leave things the way we did. Not this time.
I got an assignment from the paper. I'm going undercover. Back to high school.
I'll give you my Buick Le Sabre.
It couldn't be any clearer.
I think all you have to do, Giulia, is to close the door.
--we need more charcoal.
What!?
You wouldn't have taken me if I hadn't been doll-faced!
I'm getting out of here. What do you think?
Watch it, dipshit. You wanna rip the fuckin' bag?
Fuck you. I can carry it.
Yes.
It's bad isn't it?
If I...you know...
What's the matter? You look crazy.
What shall we call him?
And I was wondering...if...if I could have a...
No, Calvin. Babies cry.
I'm not suggesting anything, Mr. President! I've come here to tell you that, unless some action is taken promptly - and you are the only one who can take it - the oil that is the property of the people of this country will be turned over for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks!
It's the only vein I know. I tell the facts the way I see them. And any man that knows that facts -
Thanks.
Look, I know you're mad. But the way this job is, things come up at the last minute, real important things, and I gotta deal with them. Now I don't like me missing dinner any more than you do, but we're all gonna have to get used to it, cause the fact is, it's gonna happen sometimes.
Pardon me?
I'm surprised Donna didn't say anything.
I am?
Wham... .
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years, and we've been through a lot. But with that training out of High School gone, what's going to happen to us? We all know what the answers are. We want to be happy, go to college, own a car, maybe raise a family. But what if that doesn't happen? I have, I have to be honest though, I have all the hope and ambition in the world. But when I think about the future, the truth is, I am really...scared.
Thank-you. The real world.
Mr. Fitzsimmons is a very prominent man.
Oh, you're both so naive.
It's quite nice.
Where... where you going?
I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
You kidding? I don't wanna leave all this, I just wanna leave Marty...
...Drive me to a motel?
He went off someplace.
Why?
But it's pouring. And the car top is stuck!
Huh?!
Ed, I'm so happy for you.
You don't have anywhere to stay?
Well, where are you from?
Of course you don't know.
Because in my life, it wouldn't make sense for me to pick up some normal guy with a place where he's from and a place where he's going to. It'd be too simple. I probably wouldn't know how to handle a situation like that.
Then why are you shaking?
Yeah.
Hey.
None of your business.
Give it to me my Pop's job
Makin' homes for purple martins, huh? We had 'em on the farm. They're the prettiest things. That's what I wish I was, a bird. Just fly around catch bugs and have a lot of fun.
No.
Huh-huh....You son of a bitch!
Mm.
You cut off your little finger?
Go on to the next question.
You don't remember? Or you never knew.
Or her, or her - or any of them?
They are ducklings, that will grow into swans. Whereas I must be the duckling forever.
But it wasn't always so! I had a mother once! And Louis - he had a wife! He was mortal the same as she! And so was I!
Which of you did it? Which of you made me the way I am?
Because I was afraid.
Why?
Because I wasn't worthy.
Why were you afraid?
Yes.
To be a mother?
May I open my eyes now?
Why?
It grew.
No not yet Agnes, very soon but not yet. How did the baby get into you?
It's strange, being in love... It's the first time for me...
...Because I feel it.
You said there are advantages to being single. I want to know what the advantages are.
Oh, God. That's two more than me. Tell me it gets better.
I thought I was going to die.
Like what?
How?
Tom, quit fucking around.
Well, we met about three months ago. He works at the surgeon general office. He loves boating. So, he's been getting me into water skiing.
I like it! So, doll, what about you lately?
I'll go.
Would you be willing to say you wrote that letter and stick by it?
He's perfect! A baseball player. What could be more American!
Er, would you, er, would you like to make some money?
So why have you told me about it?
Listen, Sex Ape. I'm here to stay. And if you don't want me for a roommate or classmate, you got two options -- move out or ring out. End of file.
What are you going to do?
Yeah.
Ok.
Yeah.
What do you mean?
I'm terribly sorry - I have a bad memory...
That's fine with me too. When Mommy comes, tell her I'm up here.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
You were brilliant today.
Hi.
Please yourself. Let them go, if they want.
His stinking breath caused my eyes to run, that's all.
Bye.
Do you have a girlfriend, Creasy?
Excuse me, pardon, thank you, excuse me.
A friend from school.
No... No, go away.
Go away. I am not talking to you.
It's getting so a girl can't step out of the room without being discussed by a bunch of old ladies. Hello, Post... Mr. Walter Burns, please.
This is Hildy Johnson... Oh, I can give it up all right. Without a single quiver. I'm going to live like a human being -- not like you rats. Oh, is that you, Walter dear? Oh, I didn't mean "dear." That was just habit, I guess. Oh, be yourself, Walter. I've got some news for you... Yes, I got the interview, but I've got some news that's more important.
I will treasure this.
Well. It looks like someone got to his private parts before us.
I won't, I swear.
From basketball.
I know, I probably should have said it two weeks ago.
How about the time he had his house painted by the Fire Department?
Hello, Bruce...
BRUCE!! How'd you get out?
One thing... one thing... this is one thing you can do for me. I've given you gallons of free will here! You can do this for me.
There are limits.
Sort of.
That would be one point of view.
Uh-huh.
Ever been tempted?
I never have. It's not my money.
I don't know.
I want out. I want a new life. I see what I've been waiting for, but I need you, Corky.
For what?
Mickey?
He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it.
Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do.
Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
I used to be a nurse.
Yeah.
I'd give anything to have been there.
I'm not fucking him..
How'd your interview go? I'm sure you charmed the hell out of Sally.
I missed you.
It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
Good night, Oliver.
You're not leaving tomorrow..?
Nothing! I'll be out in a minute!
But more or less.
...I stank, didn't I?
Take it and welcome...but don't count on finding me here when you get back...I've been dallying around this god-forsaken wind-scour almost two long years waitin' for you...I ain't cut out to be an old maid!
What does he mean, too correct?
And ...your friend?
He's a goddamn drug dealer! These are his peak hours.
Why would I?
That sonofabitch!
Of course! That is why I placed myself here, with you, knowing Yero would pull this crap.
Look - Sam, I've been independent my whole life. I never had to ask anybody for anything. Now you're making me beg you for this.
I think I will.
And just where are you from?
I get it, Enzo you were a superior child.
What was he like, when he was little?
Because all you could think of was getting away from the guard.
Well, how did you like the class, David?
Yes, sir.
It will be okay.
I know this was right.
Of course. I wish everything were that easy.
We'll be on the other side. We'll move when you do.
Perfect.
Stay late at your work tomorrow night and I'll bring you the gear.
Fergus, I think you don't trust me.
Sure. It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today! Check this...
Well, one thing I suppose, but I don't think it has anything to do with this. A friend of mine called about two weeks ago and said she'd spotted Thomas's father working at some gas station outside of Peekskill.
Nothing...
I went to the doctor today.
Then what's going on?
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom-type rage.
Kill him. I'll pay you.
Sit down, Jake.
Jake. You're gonna be all right, Jake. You're gonna be fine.
You're here. Home. The doctor said you're lucky your brains didn't boil. What a night, Jake. It was crazy. You kept sayin' "Sarah, close the window," over and over. And talkin' to your kids. Even the dead one. Weird. You know you melted 200 pounds of ice in 8 hours. Amazing, huh?
You know, you really ought to get out today. You can't just sit around like this all the time. It's not healthy. It's not good for your mind. Go take a walk, or somethin'. Go to a movie. Christ, who's gonna know? You think I care? I don't give a shit. Go. Enjoy yourself. One of us should be having a good time. Hello! Anybody home? Anybody in there?
You're right here, Jake. You just rest. The doctor said you had a virus. That's what they say when they don't know what it is. You can't do anything for a week. He says you gotta recuperate. Now you just lie here. Mrs. Sandelman made you some chicken soup. It'll warm you up.
You better! Yes!
Please, let's not stop, George.
I know. I know how rough life can be. And how unfair. So here's what we do. Tomorrow, on the lunch yard, you walk straight up to that little jerk...
I wanna let my brother know where I am.
Yes, there is.
Don't even try it. You offend a woman out here you're in serious trouble.
Fumitsu.
As long as there isn't a fire hydrant. What I've gone through --
Everything is A-okay, but I've gotta get that sandwich!
I can leave anytime I want.
I think so. I tried to get into your cab one night, and now you want to come and take me away.
You can do it in my mouth.
I sold them to you.
Blue soup?
He's afraid of you, Harold. He knew you'd want to fight him. He doesn't know anything about fighting. He hates pain.
It seems highly intelligent to me.
Rifle?
He's in East St. Louis with his mother--visiting an aunt.
Get off the grift, Roy.
He let me live. He let me be his friend.
You do if you're where I am. Where you want to be. How'd you get that punch in the stomach, Roy?
Well, you can tell them I said they're right. I better get going. Roy'll wonder where I am.
I will. So long, Bobo.
And why am I here?
To help me.
Good. Would you like to tell me why you're here?
Because I'm in trouble.
You're listening to a chorus of angels. The music surrounds you like a... warm and, comfortable pool of water. And while you're sleeping, you're going to be able to recall, all the things that we want you to remember. And when I count to three and clap my hands, you'll no longer be hypnotised. Can you hear me.
Yes.
Who am I?
What kind of trouble? What kind of trouble Agnes?
I'm frightened.
It was really nice meeting you, Jeff. If you're ever in L.A., you should come by the offices. I talked to Pony earlier. He said he had a really nice time and he's really looking forward to reading some of your songs.
Or maybe you wanna fuck me? Everyone else has.
You and CY have a nice talk? He tell you about Sunrise Enterprises, helping people? Well, I've seen him hurt people. Why are you following me?
What is it? You want to help me, you feel sorry for me? Keep it to yourself.
So, the secret's finally out, Viktor.
Would you be bummed out if I didn't go to Chicago with you?
Nice first impression. A nose bleed in front of your parents.
Relax, baby. We're going to wind up like us.
Wait a minute, Bruce. What's commission on a 100,000.00 policy?
What do you think of that guy who works at the theatre? You know, Mark Ratner.
Well, it's either an act on your part or a miracle on Sweeney's.
I happen to know Sweeney was married only three months ago. If he's got twins this morning, I claim it was done with mirrors.
We're not interested.
I know that. You think I don't know that? "I know that's a dumb way to begin, but it's the only way I can think of to convey what happened to me the other night when I heard the two of you on the radio. On the other hand, maybe I'm just losing my mind."
Kinda like David and what's-his-name?
Well -- I found one document at the water board that had a toxic test well reading from 1967. A hell of a lot of people have lived on that land since then.
Four more. Eleven people. So far.
What d'you mean?
No thanks.
You got me out of my hotel room. You came and got me out of my room.
Do you want to meet me and talk about this stuff?
yeah.
When was the last time you had a girlfriend?
It's so nice.
Is this my birthday?
Well, those are the breaks.
Really.
You just cooking then?
I didn't know anything about her except she wanted a job because some man had left her stranded. I couldn't leave her in the street. Let's go.
So that was why she tried to run away.
We can't stay here!
Me! Me ! I still don't see why I should--! If you love him so much, why don't you go to him yourself and-- ? Or better still--get up in that Senate and fight for him!
Well--me, too!
Why don't you do it yourself?
All right-- yes ! And what does that make me to him? Nothing ! I've got to go about my own business--and forget it!
What are you talking about? What difference--?
You know Vada, you shouldn't let those girls upset you.
I didn't think you did. If you had, I wouldn't have asked you again, because I'd have remembered. How old?
Pretty old. I'll be twenty-two in August.
How old did you say you were?
I didn't say.
Is that what you want to do?
I want to be a singer. I mean, I didn't. Mother did for me.
That's a ripe old age - What do you do?
What happened to the singing? You're not in a show, are you?
Oh, no! Nothing like that. Mother always thought - she used to talk about Grand Opera for me. Imagine! An American girl, for one thing - and then my voice isn't really that kind anyway, it's just that Mother - you know what mothers are like.
Thomas J?
Anyone else residing there?
...Now, I know you've had some problems, struggling with the narcotics, some other entanglements, currently on parole -
Well, Mr. Proudfoot, this call came in past three in the morning. It's just hard for me to believe you can't remember anyone calling.
That her?
Who are you spying on?
I just had a nice chat with Cecile. I don't think she'll be giving you anymore problems.
Cool.
That's one way of looking at it.
It's like a secret society.
Cecile, everybody does it. It's just that nobody talks about it.
But that would make me a slut. Wouldn't it?
See you next weekend, Dad.
Sebastian doesn't like to go out too much.
Chet's parents don't know about it, so please keep it quiet. But you can bring someone if you like.
But it's all right, isn't it? You were able to arrange everything?
Let me get you some help, Truman. You're not well.
That's unlikely.
Why do they call them training bra's? It's not like learning to ride a bike.
I know, I guess it's just sort of preparing you for the rest of your life. It's not easy being a woman.
I don't want to go to Mexico, John. I want to be with you. Don't you think I care about you?
I wasn't singing to myself.
Where'd you leave 'em?
Here -- take this instead.
It is tomorrow. Four A.M. How come you're so late?
What happened to you?
You up?
Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don't get paid.
No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job.
Yes...if you like big hair...
What honey?
That never stopped you before.
No.
Of course.
I really hate to bother him, but...
Well, do you?
You could leave, Paul.
Tch, well, I sing! For Chrissake, Hannah, you heard me sing!
...every, eh, single rejection as- as-as a...a confirmation that you have no talent, or something?
Yeah.
No, I didn't, I, that's no. No, I- I-I, no, I-I just... hate to see you put yourself in a position where, where you get hurt, you know. You know, you know how you take...
W-why? You don't think it's realistic?
What? You don't, don't be so sensitive. Can't I say anything?
Boy, you really know how to cut me down.
I hope.
Yeah. Well, maybe I'll get it.
This time I was trying to do everything right.
What? What have we done?
Oh my God.
Sorry. I took a Benzedrine.
You know, in this light, and with that expression on your face, you look about twenty-five years old.
It's beautiful. Where'd you get it?
Can I open it?
I'm with someone.
Yeow!
What if Captain Dawson had come with me?
How did you know this was my car?
But you looked as if you liked it.
She did love him! How many women have you known?
My head -- it feels like a big wad of chewing gum. What time is it?
I feel like they do.
You're lying.
No, M'lord.
'Bye, son -- I won't be gone long.
You know where to look for your Austrian, right?
I might come back, I might not. But if I do, it won t be for a couple of hours.
Have you never heard of collect calls, Mr...
There are over 4 million people in this city - why me?
I'm so ashamed. Why didn't you just let me die?
I didn't know -- I had no idea this was your apartment --
We're going to aunt Cecile's, honey. We're going to watch fireworks from there. Let's go. Chop chop.
But you don't have a choice anymore. You've become a significant threat to the national security structure. They would've killed you already, but you got a lot of light on you. Instead, they're gonna destroy your credibility; they already have in many circles in this town. You're some kinda ego-crazed southern caricature to many folks. Be honest - the best chance you got is come up with a case, something, anything, make arrests, stir the shitstorm. You gotta hope to reach a point of critical mass where other people will come forward and the government will crack. Remember, fundamentally people are suckers for the truth, and the truth is on your side, 'bubba. I hope you get a break...
That's not even a scam.
Didn't I say?
Well, probably.
They can tell from the eyelashes, you know? He's got eyelashes yay long. They must be a foot long. The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up.
So they tell me. Not soon enough, of course. How are you, Sal? You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know. A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it. Doesn't it, Mac? You can't be the center of your own world, anymore.
You were never invited to my house.
You think, in the sphere --
What do you mean, a part of Harry?
What?
Manifested?
What about you ?
But it's on the water.
Bullshit. You'd drag me off my deathbed if it suited you.
Patrick?
The federal agent kinda half hinted Ordell might of done Beaumont.
I didn't?
Ray Nicolet with Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.
It was the other guy who busted me.
I have a pretty good idea. Ordell ain't no bootlegger and I doubt he's smugglin' Cuban cigars. So that only leaves one thing an A.T.F. man would be interested in.
Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones? Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth?
Oh yeah. You mean Peek-a-poos.
Yeah. Those. That always put the fear of God in me. What about you?
Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me.
I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs.
What little dogs?
You know those little dogs you see people with?
Like a Chihuahua?
I can see that.
I mean, look how different he looks just since high school. It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it.
I have a headache.
...You know what those nincompoops in the boardroom are doing?
Don't worry about him...
Right.
Kramer--
Kramer...There's something I ought to tell you.
Charlie, this is Bob. Bob Charlie Brown.
You're the memory guy?
No glasses.
Is he really not here?
Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
You were going to Venice.
Hi.
I figure a guy who's made some mistakes should be able to understand a girl who's made some of her own...
Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him.
But -- how can you just live for what you want? What about other people?
Do you ever regret it? The divorce, I mean.
Do you ever regret not having a family?
You really don't need anyone?
Why doesn't it scare you?
Ohh, right. Would you like a soda?
Oh! What a picture -- and what else?
Big Ringo fan.
And what do you do -- now?
No?
I don't care! We'd be together.
I can't do this. I can't leave you...
It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home -- and affection -- and peace. I couldn't do that for him, Walter. I'm what you made me -- a cheap reporter who'd give up her soul for a story!... Is that job still open?
How thoughtful of you. And what if I decide not to go?
How neat. How keen.
Only four minutes to neutral waters, sir. Why not?
Hate this part. Just sweating it out on the sidelines.
Thank you, sir. We hear back from the Pentagon?
Is this my glory, sir?
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
I'm not going to tell him. He's an asshole. I hate him.
Maybe I should check Lareaux's book. It's in the car. Be right back. Don't go anywhere.
What are these?
Only your body will remain. I believe your soul will be at peace. If we kill you, Satan can't stay.
There's water in your bathroom.
Cold is good!
I don't want to be your friend, Brian.
Please!... Trust me this much... I'll be back. Look, there is something I should tell you. The fishing club that old lady mentioned, the pieces off the flag.
You said we were criminals, what did you mean ?
Please don't be angry... believe me, it's got nothing to do with you.
Let me go get some clothes on. We'll talk, okay? Be right back.
He's not here. We're getting divorced.
Just... I have to.
Fine, she s the kid s dog. Let s go wake Josh, see if he wants to walk her.
You re having a bad day, I ll go with you...actually, there s no way in hell you re gettin me back out there...
There is no us, remember?
I don't think we have anything to talk about.
Stop it.
Want anything to drink?
It has to do with my father.
Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby!
I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl!
Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis.
Oh no. I m all right. He was a jerk, really. Another boy, you know? All I meet is boys. When I think of all the fuss about older men fancying young girls. I mean, is it true?
Still, you could never ... do what she wanted.
She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost. Coming back to haunt her.
A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick.
But she's dead!
But, Amy! Amy...I'm dead.
Oh, it is, it is! Death's terrible.
Don't cry, Amy.
It's you...Irena...my friend!
You mustn't be afraid.
She's dead! I know what it is now when people say somebody died. I know what they mean! And I'm afraid. She's dead; she's dead!
Little sister, I don't want you to feel any rush to get back to work. I want you to rest... for a while anyway.
I will, I promise.
You know, little sister, I never resented you for refusing to see me in the... the hospital. I knew you had to manage on your own before you could come back.
Thank you for understanding, Mama.
Oh, just leave those things for now.
Oh Harry...
Quiet, Mollie, quiet!
How'd you get here, Earl?
Stop screaming, Mollie or we're sunk. I'm trying to think of something before those reporters get back.
It makes a whole lot more sense than collecting Venuses.
Can't we go back, Charlie?
You always said you wanted to live in a palace.
Hurray for the bulldog! Half past eleven! The shows have just let out. People are going to night clubs and restaurants. Of course, we're different. We live in a palace - at the end of the world.
Yes. The bulldog's just gone to press.
It's not a habit. I do it because I like it.
You may be right - I sometimes wonder - but you get into the habit -
the ring up to him What's a mourning ring?
Well, if it's a real mourning ring,. I'm going to think hard for something I want more than anything else in the world before I wish.
It's a pretty ring.
A ring that I can wish on like I wished on the candles?
You're distracting me. Go away.
How many devilled eggs can you eat?
Well, this is timely. Your wife is here, would you like to speak to her?
Hello.
Hold on.
I was just trying to --
Seven -- -- queen.
Shut up and deal!
I'm going to send him a fruit cake every Christmas.
But I'm not. I'm a grown woman with a lifetime of emotional experiences you couldn't possibly understand.
What do you know about classical music?
I see things. My worst fears. You need to know something, Peter. I was possessed once. Like Birdson. It took Father Lareaux six days to pull me out of it.
Mom!
I knew we would be together forever, and that everything would be wonderful, just the way you feel about Walter. Walter. It's quite a formal name, isn't it? One of the things I truly knew was that your father and I were going to have a wonderful time ... in the sack I believe you call it --
I'm trying to make my cross look more beautiful...
What?
I was in Atlantic City with my family. Cliff was a waiter. He talked me into sneaking out for a midnight walk on the Steel Pier. I've probably told you this a million times, but I don't care. And then he held my hand. I was scared. All sorts of thing were going through my head. But after a while I forgot about them. At one point I looked down, at our hands, and I couldn't tell which fingers were mine and which were his. And I knew.
It wasn't a sign. It was a coincidence.
Then how do you explain that you both ordered exactly the same sandwich except for the bread? How many people in this world like lettuce and tomato without something else like tuna?
Magic.
Magic. It was magic.
What?
You know.
Because... because I don't know what else to do to please him.
Martie...don't go! Not this time.
We will.
No, one of us is always here to let the maid in. Nobody else has a key.
Doctor Livingston.
I'm home now.
Like you don't give her a hard time.
I am calm.
You still don't believe in God?
I don't know, Harry. I... I want so many...
Yeah.
...So you think I should go.
You can't just come in here.
What?
Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital.
There's only one thing -- I haven't been able to arrange for anyone to stay with Bobby. I don't suppose we could take him with us?
There's always somebody here, but today of course they've all got plans.
What are you doing here?
...you don't even know what you're looking for.
Why take the chance? Just let me go down there with you...
Don't you know?
We started talking. In fact, we talked until four in the morning. We discovered we shared a lot of the same interests. After that we were together all the time until he left. He used to call me every night after he came back. Then after a few weeks he invited me to come visit him. I've never left.
Maybe you're right. Maybe I'm losing my mind...
Don't tell me about me. I already know too much.
Yes. I made the choice that was right for me. And I don't regret it. But even for me, there were days when I felt so lost, so invis- ible. And then I'd hate myself for the kids not being enough.
It's the same choice you made.
I just want to spend time with them when I'm not rushing or on the phone or tired or...
Because he takes sleeping pills. He takes three sleeping pills every night at ten o'clock.
Juggle it! Move the darkroom into your house. You've got that room downstairs with the treadmill Luke never uses anyway. Don't lose your confidence. Don't lose your edge.
That's motherhood. That's the job, with or without a career. I'm telling you the biggest gift you can give them is your happiness. They need you to be happy.
Leave me alone, Norman.
Didn't think I'd ever see you again.
Good evening, Mr. Kringelein -- Where's the Baron?
Like you.
Whatever it is.
Yes.
You should write something about this.
You would think people never lived in a house if they have to ask what does 1 1 2 baths mean.
... I'm grateful to you, Chauncey... I would have opened to you with a touch, and you know that... ... But you're so strong - I can trust myself with you. I'm glad, Chauncey - I'm glad that you showed so much restraint...
I know you are, Chauncey... ... You conquer a woman from within herself, you infuse in her the need and desire and the longing for your love.
I know... ... So are you, Chauncey ... ... Do you mind my being here, like this?
... You know, Chauncey... I want us to be... I want us... You and I to become... close... I want us to become very close, you know...?
... I guess I may as well be honest about my feelings, Chauncey, as I know you are I am in love with you... I love you and I want you... And I know that you know it and I'm grateful that you've decided to wait until... Until...
Right from the start we didn't do it right. Could you kneel down?
You know I was married and that my husband died. But what you don't know is I think he and I had Bad Luck.
We got married at the City Hall and I think it gave bad luck the whole marriage.
What?
I thought you couldn't leave. I thought you couldn't get your car.
You've got a comeback for everything, don't you, Danny? You use 'em like some sort of shield.
What about the gold?
He needn't disturb you.
He won't disturb us then. I think he's after morphine. There's a war. Where you come from becomes important. And besides - we're vulnerable here. I keep hearing noises in the night. Voices.
Hello! Good morning.
Seven pounds, eight, I suppose. Why?
Excuse me?
Hello Bill.
Remind me to tell you about when I looked into the heart of an artichoke.
I'd like to hear it.
Nothing.
Well, I certainly think it's odd he hasn't even come up...
Don't let me kill the point. Or isn't it a story for grownups?
The only thing I ordered by mistake is the guests. They're domestic, too, and they don't care what they drink as long as it burns... where's Bill? He's late.
Don't be dense. The party.
I ain't dense. And he's been here twenty minutes.
Go right ahead.
I don't see where we are with it.
Have I?
No complaints.
Terrible, thank you.
I'll wait for your call.
It's a little late for that.
It's okay. I think it's a wonderful gift.
You'd like to buy your wife some lingerie as a Christmas gift.
How 'bout Christian Dior?
That's the kind of thing we are going to be interested in from now on, Mr. Carter. Right now, I wish you'd send your best man up to see Mr. Silverstone. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone if he doesn't produce his wife at once, the "Enquirer" will have him arrested. Have him tell Mr. Silverstone he's a detective from the Central Office. If Mr. Silverstone asks to see his badge, your man is to get indignant and call Mr. Silverstone an anarchist. Loudly, so that the neighbors can hear.
That's one of the things I think must be changed, Mr. Carter. The news goes on for twenty-four hours a day.
I'm not criticizing, Mr. Carter, but here's what I mean. There's a front page story in the "Chronicle," and a picture - of a woman in Brooklyn who is missing. Probably murdered. A Mrs. Harry Silverstone. Why didn't the "Enquirer" have that this morning?
I'm still hungry, Brad. Let's go to Rector's and get something decent. The "Chronicle" has a two-column headline, Mr. Carter. Why haven't we?
If the headline is big enough, it makes the new big enough. The murder of Mrs. Harry Silverstone -
The "Chronicle" doesn't say she's murdered, Mr. Carter. It says the neighbors are getting suspicious.
Mother, I can explain everything. I'll go with you in five minutes and --
You don't like it?
Could you take a look at Mrs. Porter?
Victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.
They do not have your connections.
Why didn't you call your contacts in the army?
Look I don't even wanna know how I got in this mess. I just want out. It has nothing to do with me.
What does that mean?
That's unkind.
It's not funny. He permanently sprained his neck, and since then it's been extremely difficult for him to tuck the violin.
Robert, I have to tell you something...
Daddy's very ill.
He's had two strokes.
He's not... They feel he... maybe he might not recover, and that he'll either...
You better watch out for her. She's after Charlie.
He's very interesting. For all his pretending to be a tough guy, he's really got the soul of a poet.
Mollie, drop down here! You've fainted!
All right -- all right!
I'm coming! Keep dead quiet. Don't even breathe.
Read it!
Never mind! Just play dead.
Yeah.
Can you see?
John?
Goddamit, give me my tape, then.
I can't believe you're doing this after I let you tape me.
Just admit you're wrong.
I ain't goin' to jail, and I ain't doin' that probation thing again.
Thank you, John.
That's my problem, Belle.
I know -- and you could show me the door. You would, too, if you weren't still hoping the guests might arrive.
Lying to you -- Why should I?
How can you do that? You don't live anywhere near that school.
I'd prefer we didn't refer to it as my last speech.
Sorry. Of course not, definitely not... well, maybe a little. What did you say?
What the hell are you saying?
I said I'd listen to you, not necessarily believe you. You're telling me my people are in a plot against me. You're telling me my husband wants me killed. What do you expect?
If you want me to go away, I'll go away.
My sister got a bad cough with her pneumonia. I just copied her prescription. You don't need to pay anything... just take it. But if she gets worse, you give me a call. I wrote my number on the box.
Is your niece older than 12?
I already tossed that out. Somethin' you should'a done to that woman long ago... how she treated you. Of course, that's none of my business.
Not if no one finds out.
Jody, wait.
That's not possible. No one can do that.
Who told them that?
Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor. They want me to anchor tonight!
Are you hungry? You could make us something?
Great, wallow in guilt, you sure you're not Jewish?
He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that. You know how he hates it here.
He's directing now.
The Roses? And of course they said yes.
We'll be fine.
It's no biggie.
Whatever you say.
No, Rose, he'll help you.
Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it.
Yes, sir.
Be quiet, Rose.
Because you like to remember her. I want to see you enjoy yourself.
You said we were on the same programming team.
Her?
He wants you as you want him. He's been waiting for you. He wants you for a companion. He bides his time that place. he finds them as dull and lifeless as we do.
I don't think we should... Look, you have to totally promise me you won't tell Becky about this.
Let him go, he said. Let him go.
Do you know what his soul said to me without saying a word? When he put me in that trance...
Why do you have that stupid poster?
I couldn't sleep... I should get going; I feel really weird...
Why do all guys have to play stupid guitars? It's so typical... Either they're into cars or guns or sports or guitars... it's so obvious...
Oh yes... very.
You must have been really sick.
Is it about Jacqueline?
And move to Long Island...
Whew!
Look, I know you guys are telling the truth. It's just the Shi'ites don't know that. I guess you could tell them...but then you don't speak the language do you?
You disappoint me, Epps. Always figured you to be a man; a real bright guy. I had respect for you.
Thank God.
You must be new in town.
Haven't seen you around, have I?
Pete, I'm so sorry about what they did to you. I didn't think you'd come back, I thought you'd want to write again...
Oh yeah?
I'm a teacher.
She did?
I have a way with animals.
He's beautiful.
Oh yes. I forgot.
Are you shy, Mr. Booker?
Don't wear a mask, Eddie. You don't have to. That's Turk, Eddie, the man who broke your thumbs. Only he's not going to break your thumbs. He'll break your heart, your guts. And for the same reason -- 'cause he hates you, 'cause of what you are. 'Cause of what you have and he hasn't.
Doesn't all of this come through to you, Eddie? Doesn't any of this mean anything to you? That man, this place, the people. They wear masks, Eddie. And underneath the masks they're perverted, twisted, crippled.
What the hell are you doing!?
Dolores was driving too fast.
Well maybe you're right, Jim. I'll give you one hour to solve the case... until the kids are in bed. Then you're mine and Mr. Kennedy can wait 'til morning. Come on, everybody say goodnight to Daddy.
Come on now, we'll talk about it at the table, dinner's getting cold. What are you doing in here?
Let me go! Fellows, something's happened to my mother-in-law.
Take your paws off me!
Let go o' me. What's the idea?
I'll know you've lied to me... all along. I'll know you're incapable of... love... that'll help me... not now, but eventually.
You're a fuckin' mess.
That's moronic. Why would a bit player impress a backer?
That's a good reason to dump your girlfriend.
-- no, it'll help me, really --
I told you this was gonna happen.
You and me, Roy. What a team we'll make. We think alike; we get along together. Once or twice a year we take some slob, the rest of the time we live like this. You won't regret this, Roy.
I'm not trying to make trouble, Roy. It's just, she's always so nasty to me, I thought, who is she to be so high and mighty. I saw her out there, and I called a friend of mine in Baltimore, so now I know who she is.
I'm well connected, Roy, Cole introduced me to a lot of people. Very valuable. Valuable for us.
I went out to Delmar.
No, no ...
Was it expensive, the beer?
Forgive me ... for saying you never thought of me.
Women's room, stall two. Should we stop for ice-cream?
He can't kill you --
Don't tell him --
That's all right. I think I can understand why I'm disgusting to you.
Well it's pretty obvious you don't want me around any more.
If that's how you feel --
I didn't mean it. I don't think you'd be right for each other. But I would never say you weren't as good a person as she is.
Of course I wouldn't.
I don't know...
What do you think? ... is it me?
It was. I couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something. You think I made a choice, of Danny over you. I didn't. I didn't have a choice. I'm pregnant.
That's just it. You can always get to me. There's this window in my heart and every time I leave it open, you climb in. Unless I close it now, nothing's ever going to be different!
Everything. I have a good head for business, I should be franchising the bakery. And I want you to give me your word that whatever happens, you'll go to college. And finish.
That won't make any difference. We just can't live together. And you had the nerve to drive up with that bimbo Janet.
I just can't trust you anymore.
I'm trying to save you years of frustration... waiting for a big break... no. Waiting for that big disappointment so you could blame it all on me.
Yes.
You have the largest penis. Can we go please?
Hey, Tim, you know what? You win.
Yes.
Kathy Costello. That's my maiden name.
Don't you realize how much I wanted to be you in high school? Just for one minute to feel what it was like to be popular?
But where did you finally end up?
Never mind about that. You've got to promise me you won't say a word to anybody.
I think that Phillip and Enid can help us to see that there are-many different ways we can express ourselves. We can do things like these cartoons that are amusing as a sort of light entertainment or we can do work that is more serious in scope and feeling and that deals with issues; emotional, spiritual, political; of great importance. I hope that you will each have the tools to do that type of work by the end of this class. Who is responsible for this?
What about him?
Enid. It's sort of like a diary I guess.
Can I go in?
What'd they look like?
Don't you ever get bored around here?
She was too young for him.
Why didn't you come in?
It's alright.
But but but but but it's better without...
She can't be here without me.
Ask your daddy to give you some word about when he'll be comin' home -- and tell 'im we love him.
That's why you didn't want to take the Mill out...you've...
The Firehouse...
And I'd like to point out that I've been on prescription medication, the side-effects of which...
She's beautiful. Look at her. Henry, look at her.
Did you wanna be alone?
If you can't deal with him on that basis, you better get a new counselor.
He's your boss. He's not your --
I mean, if one little comment from Gary is gonna upset you this much --
What's extreme is what that ER doctor said when he pumped your stomach. Eat another sesame seed and that's it.
Is there a rush?
It's only 7:30.
That was damn good, wad'n it? I finally did it...
I can't help it, honey, the ball just keeps goin' cocky wobbly on me...
I did, didn' I, El?
For rape and murder.
I told him that you had an E-mail death threat that said if you didn't shut the "F" up, they were going to kill you...
It is when you love someone, and they don't love you. And then you do something about it.
But she really gets to the heart of Joe, doesn't she? She's a genius.
So how much do you hate her?
Big time.
Well, I don't trust her. I never have.
She took our wedding photos, for chrissakes. You don't trust anyone.
Oh Soph...
You'll hate it in London. It's wet and miserable. A medical hellhole Sally. It's socialized. Beds in the corridors. Terrible plumbing.
I'm pregnant.
You've got Dickie's rings.
STEPHANIE?
Did you?
What was your relationship with STEPHANIE?
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
Oh, Nick! Oh I missed you so!
I thought... Oh, Nick, I thought you were hurt, some accident. Maybe you fell or maybe some car... I thought someone stole you away!
I say, why don't you go to the Stardust Ballroom? It's loaded with tomatoes.
Tomatoes.
Fine. I just go along, you know. Down at the market. Back here. I mean it just seems there's a million things to do!... Are you sure you're all right? I mean, what about the wound?
You killed my friend!
Do you know somebody called the The Cowboy?
You're broke!
No luck.
Happy anniversary, baby.
No.
Hmmm... sort of like a horse -- with a horn in the center of its forehead.
Kind of tough, I guess... But you're not liable to hunt them -- I don't think there's any alive now, anyways -- and I'm not sure but I don't think there ever were...
Would they be good to eat?
Nothing.
You don't read to fill your stomach... Poetry, for instance. All the poems in the world wouldn't fill you half as much as a bowl of eatmeal -- but they make you feel good.
You're the psycho! You haven't been able to deal with anything since high school ended!
Because you'll freak out and act like a total psycho about it.
There's something wrong with every single place we look at! Why don't you just come right out and tell me you don't want to move in with me?!
Well, what am I supposed to say? "I can't wait to live in some depressing shit-hole in the middle of nowhere"?!
A mistake... it was a mistake...
Agnes, how did your mother get you?
Like you?
From someone who didn't want to have a baby.
A mistake...
How would that person get one if they didn't want one?
Well I don't think I'm old enough and besides I don't want to have a baby.
If you did want one, how'd you go about getting one?
Because I don't want one.
Yes.
Yeah, I did.
Did what?
Steve?
Fuck you.
I just want to be on my own for a while.
holds up a loaded fork. Pauline reluctantly takes it.
On what?
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow you'll be healthier still.
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.
I may not sue.
None of that innocent stuff, you double-crossing hyena! You stuck Bruce Baldwin in jail this afternoon on a phony charge that he swiped your watch, and you frisked his wallet! Now, give me that wallet or I'll stick you in jail and it won't be on any phony charge either! It'll be for life!
Such as?
So I guess your Grandpa and Grandma know her.
Well! Nothing like experimenting.
Don't make me out to be a sucker. Louise Bonner says there's trouble in there. You remember last night. Sometimes she's wrong, but if there is trouble - get rid of it.
Honey, this is Thursday. I pick you up tomorrow, and we do big spaghetti.
Would it work?
We can refuse to talk.
I'm going home to my machine.
Happy for us... okay. Here's the number. 404-453-2222.
Call me later, hon.
Well, I'm happy for you.
Wait. Did I just say "hon" to him?
Did he? That's more than we get to do.
Susie's not a virgin anymore.
I can't get over what those guys did to her. I just can't.
Just some In-Valid. Vincent-- --somebody.
No... how long did you say?
No, it's not that...
I already did that. I want to be a dancer, I want to dance.
No.
In the South Wing.
When...when will she be back?
I'm talking to you asshole !
You bastard!
It's okay, my sweet.
Oh, Craiggy, that's brilliant!
What?
Roy, that's fine, but I don't have time for this. Bobo --
Bobo isn't after you! Bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! But so am I. I'm a survivor, Roy. I survive.
And to survive, my way, I need money. Bobo knows about the stash in the car, so I didn't dare touch it, not if Lilly Dillon's dead. So that leaves this.
You want a drink?
What?
Telling you...
All right. Have your strike. I'll have my baby. But no hospital will take me, because I'll be a striker's wife. The store will cut off our credit, and the kids will go hungry. And we'll get behind on the payments again, and then they'll come and take away the radio...
What has it got me, your union?
I see. The men. You'll strike, maybe, for your demands -- but what the wives want, that comes later, always later.
What's more important than sanitation?
Two hundred dollars, please.
We won the championship.
Right here.
Like hell you ain't!
What's the matter now?
Here!
Let's go.
Huh?
I'm okay.
I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
And you have to meet my father.
Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em!
Do you... remember me?
Isn't that nice? You should bring her home to meet us!
No, no, no, this is a job that's hard to keep, not a job that's hard to lose, can't be both.
Duncan. I've got an even better idea...
Oh, baby, I'm so sor...
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT!!
Probably shot a few. Scattered the rest. Murderers.
Mm-hm.
What'd you give for that thing?
I really like him, Rose. He's so... ...passionate about his work.
We are animals after all.
I'm not sure.
Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan?
Why not?
We could try pushing the other buttons. I have a flashlight in my purse.
Just twelve.
What happened?
I was leaning way over, to see the... ah... propellers. And I slipped and I would have gone overboard... and Mr. Dawson here saved me and he almost went over himself.
No, I... I never killed anyone!
I saw a poor monk without shoes so I gave him some.
No Juliet?!
Why?
Hey, what are you doing? Why are you wearing a suit again?
Hi.
Do you remember me, I left my car, yesterday.
This is Lena, she's a good friend of mine from work. We were in the neighborhood and she had to pick up her car and we're getting breakfast before we go in, so did you want to go? We're gonna go and eat, let's go.
What do I do with my free afternoon, walk you to the airport?
Thomas Kent!
Oh.
Oh, yeah, really, oh!
Oh, neat... oh, that's very nice, gosh, thanks a lot.
No, no, no, not at all.
So. Where are we sitting?
They weren't my shoes. Mine were too small.
No, Alex. It's, it's --
She's crying.
Where'd you get this?
Bud?
Payn tash-chiton v'ashiytem...
This is me.
You were a tiger last night.
My father's.
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda. Maybe L.B. did it.
My husband is the victim of an informer in your organization, not ours.
You're charming the boy.
You see what you're doing, don't you?
Frankie Lazzaro. Coming down the courthouse steps every day in the media. Children see this. They think you're the Secretary of the Treasury.
Well...
Oh no! No! I can't believe it. I can't believe it. Both of them, both brothers, oh my God!
I don't think so, Jim...
Huh?
So? How'd it go last night?
What if you hide me?
Well... if they're looking for me in memories I'm in, what if you take me to a memory I'm not in? And we can hide there till morning.
Some people take, some people get took -- and they know they're getting took -- and there's nothing they can do about it.
I know so. He's a taker.
I wonder how long it takes to get someone you're stuck on out of your system? If they'd only invent some kind of a pump for that --
I really ought to be getting home. My family will be flipping by now.
I'm gonna need some money.
She shot you down.
You look upset.
What'd you do that for? It's an in- teresting story. All these people are still disappearing. Right off the street. Hey, what's wrong? Are you all right?
You son-of-a-bitch. Who do you think you are? I don't deserve this. Who takes care of you day and night? Who cleans the floor and washes your goddamn underwear? Well, I've had it. You flip out on your own, you ungrateful bastard. I'm done holding your hand. I don't want anything to do with you, you hear? Nothing!
You're out of your fucking mind. I'm not gonna stand around here gettin' interrogated by you.
Yeah.
Whatever...
Well, they paid for the doctor's visit.
They did?
Thank you. It's in remission now, thank the Lord, but you never know. And then while that's going on, I end up having to have a hysterectomy. Plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. All benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.
I'll say. Holy moley.
I know. They're more than a bit unusual. See, two years ago, Pete got Hodgkin's disease. That's a kind of cancer --
Yeah, I'm real sorry to hear that.
Are you kidding? With how our lives are, if I start subdividing files, I'll be sunk. I just kept all PG E correspondence in one place.
Right, but -- I'm sorry, I don't see why you were corresponding with PG E about it in the first place.
So the whole idea of selling the house -- don't get me wrong, I'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, I just don't see the point.
Yeah, I can see that. I guess the only thing that confused me is - - not that your medical problems aren't important, but -- how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?
Will you go to her and tell her Right in front of me she's Nothing to you? Right out loud so I can hear? Tell her she's Nothing, tell her she's nobody, Just dirt? Will you do that?
Great.
I thought we agreed that we were going to be friends.
I'm not going to speak to you till you realize that you can't intimidate me.
It was fine.
No thank you.
Give it up.
David --
Right.
Thanks....
That'll teach me to wear white after Labor Day.
I don't want to drag you down with me.
Forget about me. You have enough problems of your own.
Of course, dear.
I don't think I remember him.
Do you remember Emilio DiGiorgio, owned the tavern in Abruzzi?
Oh.
That's nice. I gotta letter from my husband's cousin in Abruzzi. His mother died.
We gotta postcard from my son Nickie and his bride. They're inna big hotel in Florida on their honeymoon. Everything is very nice.
That's nice.
Well, he died. You know who else died?
She's amazing. She's ninety-three, she's a writer, and I told her about you.
I never fucked up before, Bobo.
Bobo, no, I --
My son --
He left home a long time ago. He was in the hospital, up in Los Ang gleez, real sick.
I'm very tired. And I'll have a long drive tomorrow. All the way back to Phoenix.
And back with MacFarlane and all that he stands for the next day.
There's no standing between a fool and his folly. If you must babble your news to him he's at the Fisherman's Tryst. It's the inn at Pennycuik. You can use MacFarlane's horse and gig to get there. He'll welcome the ride back.
Yes, it's lame.
Are you kidding, Josie? It's lame. All they do is stand around and get drunk. It's lame.
I am sorry. I only felt... it seemed she was harming you. I meant...
I know, I just want to give him a thrill.
That's a tough one. Have you ever seen combat?
You've got to get used to working Christmas. People are always screaming and yelling... then they get home and they're all Christmasy.
I think Christmas brings out the worst in people.
Do you sail?
Are you scared?
-- But he does seem very nice.
It was right there on top. Isn't she pretty?
She was very pretty.
Lots of things.
Oh.
How can you just take a life ? I mean it's a life, life is so precious. How does it feel ?
What are you looking for?
Can I just sit here while you're packing?
They're right here.
The marble?
Yeah, well I like to think I'm just a little past hanging out on JP II watching the Irish pick fights and Litwalks barf in the planters.
Food and supplies? Who for? Like starving people?
Why?! Who the hell knows?!
It never works out because I'm into legs and butts and hair myself! That's why! So I wind up with guys who are very good looking, but even more shallow than I am, if you can picture that. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go find another low-paying, demeaning job where some guy named Jerry keeps telling me how lousy his marriage is.
What about the phosphorous grenade?
How long would you need me?
Ugnh.
Okay.
I don't have a boyfriend.
Well, I --
It's not his fault!
Make that sixty and I'm docking your allowance for two weeks.
You think this is easy for me? You go out on the town and I get to be the bad guy. Look I don't want you to be some punk hoodlum delinquent but I can't do my job as a parent if you don't do your job as a kid.
You're grounded 'till you're fifty!
I agree --
What's the way?
He did it.
Work related or otherwise?
DeLa, kiss my big black ass.
... Sally?
Those aren't mine.
Never.
What's it about?
Was that cannon fire, or is it my heart pounding?
Are you in love with her?
I love you like my Dad loves Shelly. I wanna live here.
No he wouldn't, I can't go home.
Justin and Ronda say that I should tell people what I feel.
Strange. I know so very little about you.
Are you seeing Betty tonight?
Well you should all go to bed early. I'll do the cleaning up.
Mom's orders.
Huh?
Sorry.
My mouth is kinda dry.
Hey.
I'm looking at new cars.
... while children in Africa and Asia are napalmed and --
I don't understand any of that.
What was that all about?
Do you want me not to go tonight?
Yes... I'll give you that.
...he stuck a fishhook in it.
Are you?
...yes.
I'm still shaking.
Mark is a really nice boy...
There. That's right.
This is supposed ta be Siam or some such. Some kinda lousy B-B-Balinese temple. This look like a temple to you? I can't see it myself--
When did they find her?
Nuts. She only cares about the money. She thinks I'll make you cut her out of the w-w-w-w... will.
Are you really serious? About acting?
I wouldn't miss it.
Are you an actor?
You can always come see it in London.
That's not what I heard.
They're dead?
Been busy, have you.
It's been a while.
It's still available I hope?
She was torn apart! She died of a broken heart.
I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the quot;Dino Raphael quot; Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving.
Here's the part where I'm supposed to get all defensive and say... 'not until I speak with my attorney.'
He wanted me to leave Dave and marry him. Last Friday I told him it wouldn't work. Dave would have killed us both! He followed me home and kicked up a stink in the street, I had to tell Frank I couldn't see him any more. It was getting too dodgy. That was on Sunday. He said he'd kill himself. I was frightened what you might do.
It's the truth.
I don't know nothing.
Oh!
Thanks.
The usual, 9:15.
When?
Oh... You know...
I was just wondering... Nick... You're going hunting... If I could use this place to stay, because...
I'd want to pay you... and I was thinking --
Hi. Nick, your shoes are soaking.
I would want to pay you, Nick... and I was thinking --
Yeah. Have you seen Telly around?
Just a lot of crazy shit.
If you came back. If you survived at all. Which it's pretty certain you wouldn't.
You want some berries?
Mmmm. Boy. It's hot up here.
What's that like?
Do they have an Ocean? I've heard about the ocean.
Sounds fantastic. You know some kids came up here the other night to go swimming--took off all their clothes.
How?
He's just mentally retarded, I guess.
He'll be here in a little while, he's takin' me to get an ice cream.
Yeah, that's right, Frank, you better ask him. I mean, don't hurt his feelin's or anything, but it would be good to know. I'm sure it's nothin'. He seems real sweet.
You're not crippled. Get in there and make somethin'.
Hey. There.
It's temporary.
Yeah.
I didn't have no wedding cake, no reception or nothing. Johnny got down on his knees and proposed to me at The Grand Ticino.
Maybe I like garbage.
But you have to consider all possibilities, Sandro.
Perhaps she wasn't feeling well... Maybe a cramp or something...
Right, but -- didn't you say he was paid by PG E?
No. Hunh-uh, see, that's not what the doctor said. He said one's got absolutely nothing to do with the other.
Peggy Sue!
You think it could make you sick, living in a place like this?
Thanks for reminding me.
Seems like an awful big coincidence -- your water being messed with and you being so sick.
Counts?
Why good?
Can I use your bathroom first?
Oh, yes, Father certainly would.
Hey...
I can't.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
That's none of your business.
I'm busy.
That's also none of your business.
You truly want to do something to make me happy?
And you promise to abide by it?
God help you, Lynette!
You're no better than me, Paula! You're just the same!
Already come and gone. Can you believe it? He DORed in the twelfth week. How can you win?
That there isn't one, as of today. I had my period. I couldn't believe it. He still wanted to marry me.
Of course. I don't want no Okie from Muscogee. I can get that right here in Port Angeles.
Of course there was a baby. I'd never lie about something like that. Would I, Paula?
Bump?
It's Kathryn.
I-I can do the job, sir.
I'll try anyway, sir.
Thank you, sir. But I like these just fine.
A sawbuck!
Oh.
No.
Well, your children are very bright-- and they say Jefferson Smith.
Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. Now I'm embarrassed that I say this.
No wonder--without your dinner.
You are well?
You know why? He tries to hold her. She resists
Beautiful?
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look?
Lift me down.
There. All done. Lift me down.
Sure. I'll... have another Coke.
To take dictation -- a Mr. Preysing -- Goodbye, you -- tomorrow at five o'clock.
Good to know.
Well, there's the Hamiltons. Joe and Shelly Hamilton.
Okay.
Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
Uh... Sheriff... Uh...
Maybe you should... hang the carpenter.
We have to send somebody over there immediately! If we prove the forgery we can cancel the policy. We'll be off the hook. There's a flight to Rome in two hours and from there its just a short hop to Sicily.
They're not open yet?
Hi. Do you work at the mechanic?
Is it ok if I leave my car you think?
Hello Paul. Is Telly inside?
I can't believe it! But what about Doug?
I didn't tell anyone I applied cause I never thought I'd make it.
Well I might go to Dartmouth.
Yeah. Basketball just, isn't fun anymore. You know?
The idea was out there in the universe. Now what?
Where's Mrs. Baldwin?
What happened?
What's he like?
I'd rather sit. Are you ready?
Oh, okay. Well, sure, I'll just... Take care, then.
Cynthia Patrice Bishop.
I was... eight years old. Michael Green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. I said he could if I could watch him take one, too. He said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. I got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "Ladies first!" So I pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before I even finished.
Joel? It's Joel, right?
Whew, at last. Nice to meet you, Mr. Black.
No, I'm not.
No.
Hi.
You're going to miss the train.
No.
Mischief? What the fuck you talkin' about, mischief?
Okay then...
I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
And you're a tired little boy. I'll make up the cot and you must get some sleep.
Good morning to you...whatsa matter?
What do you think?
I can't be a burden, especially now. I know I'll get used to things. I guess I wanted to know what someone who's lived here thinks. Upstate, it was a completely different environment. I don't know if David told you, but I teach fifth grade, or did.
I know.
You did, didn't you?
You bastard.
Yeah, okay. Sure, Norman.
No, I should stay calm. Like you say. Right, Norman? Stay calm.
Yes! The notary is a phony. He has the same signature as the contractor!
Who's the greatest cocksucker in the world? C'mon --
Don't. I'm married. I don't feel good. I've been sick.
Oh shit.
Stop.
I'm spinning.
I guess I'm startin' to feel a little better.
Really?
There were more flowers last year. Mr. Rinaldi down at the drugstore says it's going to snow by New Year's. Says he can feel it in his elbows. I hope it snows. I want to make a snowman. You ever make a snowman, Jack?
Pretty darn good, ya want some?
We need ice.
My pleasure.
That's Frances. I'm not the cookbook.
If you won't sleep with me this time, Benjamin, I want you to know you can call me up any time you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.
Do you know him?
I want to say something first.
Don't be nervous.
Well, don't tell the fellows in the office about the appendix. They may get the wrong idea how you found out. 'Bye.
Beidermeyer?
I was really very moved by the way you...
Is that funny?
Why?
My turn.
That was beautiful, Robert. I'm surprised...
Mm.
Do you understand what I said?
Fine.
Did you not enter this country illegally?
Everyone needs a plant. This ivy is one tough baby. It's a cutting from one of mine.
Are you a doctor?
Steve, dear, please forget all of this. What can it matter after tomorrow?
If the stores are open -
And on Tuesday - Hasenpfeffer. STEVE How do you think I realized I love you?
I made you write a beautiful song...
That's terrible.
See, Daddy.
Uh huh, i've been trying to get out to Hollywood for years to do makeup for all the stars, I haven't gotten there yet. All right, open your eyes.
We're going to have to explain away the...
No I didn't.
No -- it has to be done by tomorrow.
If you want me to.
Why didn't you tell me?
And you say this stuff, this hexavalent chromium -- it's poisonous?
Yeah.
Horses.
Tell me, is it bad news?
Music.
Mom, please?
I think I'm going to have my hands full with the son of mine when you leave. Just might be his first broken heart.
Oh, how sweet.
What?
Thank you.
I couldn't help it I loved him.
Dr. Lester, would you point me toward the restroom?
Everyday things...yes.
You have an incredible memory.
I've been a Little dyspeptic.
But, I'll take some of that Nyquil... you know it puts you right to sleep no matter what's wrong, you go right off...
Your hair fell out? Just like your father. Weak hair.
What do I know about Williams?
What is it?
Quite sure. I find it just a bit too - too "Seventeenish" for me...
Oh, come now, as though you were an old lady... I'm on my way. Is there anything more you've thought of-?
There's the script to go back to the Guild-
I've got it.
- and those checks or whatever it is for the income tax man.
Right here.
It seems I can't think of a thing you haven't thought of...
That's my job. See you at tea time...
Nobody told me. I did see him!
Why are you saying it?
I hope you're well.
I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.
What about your twelve brothers?
Then you gotta hide it somewhere. Somewhere where nobody's gonna find it...for 29 years! Put it under the loose floorboard by the window!
It is a disgusting habit, Bertie. It should be discouraged.
It is quite late enough.
I'd be very surprised if our suspect was from Brainerd.
Really? It makes me sick.
Buttfucks the cabin?
They believe the innocent are guilty and the guilty are innocent.
So it's a good plan but it goes wrong; Mueller flips out and shoots their fall guy, which means they have to bring Dunbar and Kendall into the cover story --
Little bit.
So that the Old Mill, the Old Mill represents...the wheel of fate is that too...
Oh! You got nerve, buddy.
I just wanted to say that. Come by my house.
Oh, just like in the script!
What do you want, Stan?
Then why did you ask me?
Devil worshippers!
I don't think that's so revealing.
I don't know.
I'm at sea, Jason.
It's all clear to me now -- so clear.
Don't you expect me to be a little hurt?
Sure you could, Earl -- but you wouldn't want to do that, would you? You wouldn't want to kill anybody.
Earl, there's just one thing I ought to clear up for the interview.
Earl, you must never do that again.
What?
He doesn't deserve this! You don't know him. It isn't fair!
Yes, sir.
Just say no?
Oh, something. . romantic?
But why did you want to?
Because I wanted to.
Why did you do that?
What!?
Cynthia!
Yes, I did.
Did you take your clothes off?
Cynthia, who knows where that tape may end up? He could be... bouncing it off some satellite or something. Some horny old men in South America or something could be watching it.
I wanted him to see me.
That doesn't help anything, Bill.
No.
Yeah. I'll get some ice.
Yeah.
Sure. Sure, uh, yes.
Hey, Hannah, did you read that last thing Holly wrote? It was great. She's really developed.
I know, she...she really writes good dialogue.
It's on the table, Dad.
I'm so scared...
I'm not saying another word.
Thank you, Tom. I feel so much better just having blown this off.
I know, I know. I do not want to move to Seattle. But what I really don't want to do is end up always wondering what might have happened and knowing I could have done something. What do you think? It's just cold feet, isn't it? Everyone panics before they get married, didn't you?
You know our two most senior Senators: Gaius Cantus and Falco Verus?
Narcissus! Terrified? You? The only thing he's scared of is me.
I mean, why did you get married? Was it all fireworks and trumpets and --
Now, Holly's not shy.
Yeah, I know, Mom. NORMA But I, I knew that he'd get up there and he'd flounder around with his expensive haircuts and hairdos and clothes. He's all show! Now how can you act when there's nothing inside to come out?!
I just had a lot of luck...from my first show, you know? I've always thought Lee was the one destined for great things.
Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
You mean you don't want their votes to count, Billy!
No they're not.
No I'm not. I don't care. Why should I care? I mean nobody asked me when you got divorced. Nobody asked me if I wanted a new mother. Nobody even asked me if I like her. If you guys don't care about our family staying together, why sh...
Look she's upset --
It gets worse there. Leavin' me to my own mind. That's just not good.
Just give yourself a little pep talk. "Must try other people's clean silverware as part of the fun of dining out."
What do you care?
Come in, come in.
...because there are no interesting single men at this party!
I mean, I've looked everywhere.
So, do you enjoy being an actor?
I have to see you. Can you call him and invite us over?
That's my fault. I get too worked up at these. I'm very method. You do know... that's not my name.
When?
Give me one hour to get inside him Exactly.
Thanks so much for coming over.
Fuck Maxine.
And he killed every last one of 'em!
Yes?
Well, fuck! Might as well not do anything! Let's just stick out thumbs up our asses and twirl.
Sixty-five.
Lynch him! Lynch him!
Oh, yes --
Bluebeard!
Good morning, my lord!
I'm not doing it anywhere, Jeff. It's just part of my application to the School of Visual Arts in New York.
Will you call me before Thanksgiving?
Be careful.
Stop nagging.
Sshh.
Nothing.
No.
Okay. So we'll get what you want. What do you want?
Same thing, Daddy. Mommy says --
Okay.
Thank you, Max.
She's my gynecologist.
It violates so many trusts.
Joanne Bourne.
Nicky, no. This is insupportable. How could you?
I never thought of Dr. Wetzel as having a sex life outside the office.
Don't pay any attention to him. It's very good.
Jos, that's not what we're --
No - It's just a lot of pressure for your first piece, that's all. I mean, it's not a half-page article, it's a major undercover piece, Jos. Look what Rigfort did to Dutton - and that guy's his cousin!
And Gus - when you picked up knitting, who showed you how to hold the needles?
That's a first. Most people praised me for it.
You did?
Take yourself. You've slept with several women. Are you happier because of it?
I wasn't knocking anything. It's just my belief that people shouldn't actually experience the act of love until they are in love and that people our age are too immature to be in touch with those emotions.
A friend wrote me.
I didn't tell 'em anything.
His wife?
She knows every neat junk food place.
Hi.
You can stay here for a couple of days if it'll help.
Not really. I'd forgotten how long it's been since I've done this. And I couldn't get any Parmesan cheese.
I am comfortable.
You missed a button.
Thank you. They hated me. I don't hate them.
Yeah. She told me. You walk her to school.
Bye, Dad. See you in the morning, okay?
What do you want?
No. I just kind of like the sound of it.
California.
Oh, Norville --
I wish it were that simple, Norville. I wish I was still a gazelle, and you were an antelope or an ibex.
Oh, I don't know. Maybe I was just a fast-talking career gal who thought she was one of the boys --
Says they were deserters, they were afraid to fight, don't believe in Saddam anyway. They flew the gunship up here to hide out. When they saw us they figured we were going to kill them, so they shot first.
He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands.
I told you; don't push me around.
Says he's one of the soldiers that was in the helicopter.
Alone? On a two lane road? With a ton of Valium in your system?
Why?
I started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. A blond. I only caught a glimpse. She was young. I should have said something right away. But I didn't.
Mary, Honey. I talked too much, like always -- he thinks you told Elaine the things I told her.
I don't care what he thinks.
He thinks it could be made into something.
Nothing.
-- oh I thought you were --
Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work.
No, no, Roy, just cash poor. They had savings accounts, stocks to sell, houses to mortgage. Sell their wife's jewelry. Oh, they had a lot of money, when they put their minds to it. Or when I put their minds to it. I stayed with them, that's the roper's job, made them get up every penny they could raise, turn it all over to Cole.
I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man.
He didn't think they were risks. He was so good, Roy, he could just play with the mark.
He'd explain he had to have cash, so there wouldn't be any paper trail for the SEC. And a lot of cash, or it wasn't worth while. The least we ever took was forty thousand, and the most was one hundred eighty-five thousand dollars! From one sucker!
How do you like my hair?
Goodbye.
This is my old friend Carol.. I told you about her.
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I love you, Will. No take-backs.
I never cared about that.
Afraid? I should say not!
Um--hello? You want to like take a look?
For Christ sake, I said it, I didn't do it. Besides, I don't think they were too offended, do you?
Gunfire? Is this a joke?
Hello?
Caesar, what are we going to do?
How do I know you are cops?
A miracle. Well, that's news.
You're frightened, aren't you, Norman?
They stopped.
So.
I mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.
It was a racial incident.
Oh, yeah?
It got that close.
You are right. What can I...
No, I don't...NO. I thought we were just friends.
I thought I was helping you.
Okay, but then we'll just be friends. Okay?
Still, there have been rewards. It's sunny. And some of the producers who call even have credits.
What did you do? To make them take the early 70's away from you.
You don't know how I've compromised my standards.
You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess.
Someone from the village.
Wait, won't you join me for a cup of coffee?
Do I look like it that much?
My first organic-polymerization was a lab mouse.
Robert...
I have to talk seriously with you...
Well, Herbert's mostly on the mainland because of the orchestra, so at the moment, there's just Daddy, Carl and myself... and Van Oost.
Catherine -- she's a pianist. She's working with Carl.
Well, 11 months ago he was on his bicycle, on his way to the post office in La Roche... and he ran into a Jeep and sprained his neck...
Have you ever known anybody a long time?
Ten years.
Uh-huh.
I used to be a nurse.
Thank you.
How old is he?
Mrs. Simmonds.
Who told you that?
What's happening?
But it was just mine.
But I'm just trying to leave.
Your mom had to...help a friend with this...emergency? And she called me. And we switched days. Then, I got stuck on my shoot, and...
Yeah.
Do you need a secretary?
Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
What'd you put him in there for?
You make me feel...
Oh, yes, sir, all day long. He never leaves the house until evening. He just sits there, writing and writing. He doesn't even eat.
Oh, I wouldn't know that, sir.
I think I've found out about the money, sir.
A Pilates machine?
I'm fine, ba...
That I do. Always will.
Of course, you do. Being magic. Then you know I've got a flu bug, and I turn green and barf profusely when I even think about food. So, all the more meatballs for you. But you know what.
I can't see Outpost putting its reputation in the hands of people like that.
Are you saying you think they had something to do with his death? Nelson said it was an airtight case.
They hack into people's programs?
What? Please? Now? Tell me?!
Mrs. Connelly. I'm Martin Bettes ... Dr. Bettes.
Not your name... what are you telling me your name for!! Where is he?
He's in the bathroom... He's fine.
Tell me how bad it is. I let him go out last night when it was so cool without an overshirt -- just and underone with just the straps and I know better... and I let him talk me into it. He was whining and... you don't need this. Give me a second to catch hold.
Dad.
You're lying. I'm not human.
I pay, too. They also pay who meet in hotel rooms.
Mom, he just fixed our car.
We can see each other, we can even have dinner... but respectably, in my house with my mother's picture on the mantel and my sister helping me broil a big steak for three!
Don't call me that.
You fucking cow, can't you read?!
The Headless Horseman --
I like stories.
Mommy read it to ne.
Then I'll tell you a story a lovely story. Do you know the story of Rapunzel?
It was shot off long ago in the great battles that were fought here; with the British on one side and the Americans on the other.
Why hasn't he got a head?
Why yes.
Someone left the goddamn gate open. Otis got out. Skye and I, well the... I came out of the house and the fucking gate was wide open.
How long ago was it?
Sid...you got me so...I don't know what...
... take off my clothes and then... she makes fun of me.
Yes?
She can.
She can't hurt you any more.
She watches... she listens.
How?
She...
Agnes, I don't believe that. Tell me. I'll protect you from her.
... makes me...
Yes?
Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
Me too. There's this poem --
And he has a really hot ass with hardly any hair on it.
I was talking about Miles.
I think, before.
I love you, Grady.
Pow.
She said convincingly.
Aren't you happy? Don't you feel proud...? I feel proud and all I did was watch.
- don't run out of adjectives, dear.
It's just possible she didn't...
That's on time for Margo.
Margo hasn't done badly by it.
He rents it for the summer. Bodhi always gets some slick place and throws it open to every surf burnout around. Most a these guys can't keep a job. When the swell comes, they're gone, they have to ride.
Thank you, sir, I appreciate that. Everybody, thanks. Gives some chips as tips to the dealer and box man. Thanks. Take care, Steve. Take chances and drive fast.
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Thank you very much. Thank you very much.
Come on.
What money? Look at this stack of chips. Don't give me that shit. I want my end.
Don't be cross with him, Ma. This don't happen every day.
...unworthy of the adoration. We all do.
Just the way Dolores gets so excited about bringing the kids to check out the animals. It's like the biggest thing in her life.
You were there?
I'm coming!
Typical army brat story. Dad was noncom, Mom was a Nurse. There was never any real doubt of joining up.
What is that?
You're kidding.
Something like that. You?
I don't know. What are they?
Nothing wrong with old age, Frank...long as you get there.
What do you want here?
But you've got to see your parole officer in the afternoon and I promised we'd take Judy to F.A.O. Schwarz.
I'm cold as ice.
Why should I? I know you're not a cop, so what is it tonight? Another two-fifty to watch you sleep?
What's up?
I just don't want to go.
At the bar - Sidney...
She will if you think she should.
Sidney, can I talk to you a minute?
Don't you ever get messages, Eyelashes? I called you twice.
Yo, where's the "D"?
I won.
I wish, but it's full. They recommended a pension in town. They say that all of Taormina is full. What's going on here?
Do you know what you're going to do?
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Hello.
Eduard didn't see it as something that needed bearing.
I've been going over and over my experience last night. It was amazing. I've decided I'm a transsexual. Isn't that the craziest thing?
Fuck pets. Is this your partner? I had to come back and do the Malkovich ride again. Fuck everything else. Is this her?
Yes, Hi.
Yes, hello, I wanted to place an ad. Hi, are you Craig's wife?
Hi. Have you done Malkovich yet?
Hi, uh. Hi. I wanted to place an ad. Yes. "Ever want to be someone else?" No, that's the ad, but let's talk about you in a minute. "Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding..."
Could you approve them now? I'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.
You've got a family tragedy on your hands. Will you tell me what's funny about that? About a kid in a coma?
I dunno, Toby. We really have a long way to go. You still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening
We're not ready.
Oh, no, I can't let you do that.
Why, I'm fond of Thea.
Yes.
Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.
Fine.
Jesus...
It's not my voice ... but I know her.
Anything I might know about?
Are you asking me to marry you?
Yeah.
If he were still alive, maybe.
I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony.
Exactly! So I dug it, and I did a lot of research.
Sort of...
No great lady will ever take my place?
But how -- how long--?
No. It should be dry by now.
Overnight. What about just now?
Carryin' a gun.
I just want to know while we were seeing each other... I just don't want girls looking at me and knowing and me not knowing...
Oh, yes, yes.
We really had a good time.
Call me sometime.
Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly?
It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews.
'Cause he wasn't a rabbi.
Call the number.
Did he? I left school and worked for the Labour Party. My older brother, George, had just been killed in Greece, and he'd been an active member. I hero-worshipped him. He was 25 years old ... It was an exciting time for us, those first couple of years after the war. We thought the country was about to become a true democracy. I can understand why people of your generation want to write about that time. They feel betrayed. They want to know what went wrong.
Ronnie...
Maybe we should give him another sedative.
Good! But you don't have to tell the whole valley 'bout it! You'll get that woman in trouble!
You're not having lunch?
I'm sorry...I just mentioned it in passing. I never thought he'd use it.
Where?
You heard anything yet?
What is it?
I'm a junior.
Oh. Uh, my stepmom took me to the doctor yesterday and they said I was twelve weeks.
She's joking. Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, which is just one of her many genetic gifts.
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.
Yes...
I also have good teeth. No cavities. We finally got fluoridated water in Dancing Elk.
Yeah. You?
I am...
Just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.
Don't you think you should at least wave?
I've had them since the day they were born.
He forgot his money... My mother's got a pub, behind the corner, and he forgot his money, about 100 .
I'm concentrating on my career right now.
Better than I...
Well, you do reside their at 1425 Fremont Terrace?
Maybe there ought to be less racket and more us.
I knew. I sensed it when I heard your voice.
He's better, isn't he?
I was going nuts in that waiting room so I came back to check on my mom.
I know. It's awful, isn't it? Night of the Living Cheerleaders.
Sleeping.
No. Thank you. I'm in... a hurry. I just want to make a change and start...
What letter?
What's that?
I remember, distinctly, being fired.
Oh!
What?
To flaunt your deviance in public? Upon a stage?
You'll always remember your first time.
It was nice.
Was it great?
It was okay.
Yes.
WHICH CAR?
Yes... I am really nineteen.
Do you owe anybody money? You can tell me off the record if you need too.
Come on up.
Shhhh.
It's alright, Dad.
I know, Dad. I love you too.
Nunez was chasing Dunbar.
Yeah. You gave up your hot tub tape to save me. That's real progress for you.
M'hm.
But you didn't see it, right?
Well, as you like to point out, Mister LaPlante, I'm relatively inexperienced. My naivete may have worked to your benefit in this instance.
He wants playmates. Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material.
What difference does it make?
Get down here and talk to me, goddamn it! Don't fuckin' ignore me! You motherfucker!
Honey, I'm not worried about you. You are going to be a fantastic mom. Not an issue. I pressed you, remember? Joe, on the other hand, is a different story.
No, no, not at all... I mean I've still got plenty of time. Don't I? I mean I still have a good six years, whatever. We could have three kids yet, if we wanted. And I know I've always said I never wanted kids, and I didn't... but this year, I really, truly, feel ready...
Oh, Johnny, Mr. Karpf needed a ride home and I said we'd take him. Do you mind?
You promised a nice place -- can't you just... You have these dry cleaned all the time, don't you?
What if I have a previous engagement?
It's not possible...
I'd spell it out for you -- only I can't spell.
I don't know. I guess that's the way it crumbles -- cookie-wise.
The nerve.
He wouldn't.
It makes us human ...
Gesture?
We don't have to put ourselves through this again, Dick.
Want to kill yourself? Are you saying that you're drinking as a way to kill yourself?
First. It's our first. I'm just concerned. So... why are you killing yourself?
Very clever.
Yes.
I'm from the East. I went to college, did an arts course. I now live in Vegas. I think of it as home. I came here deliberately to carve out a life. I was in LA before, but I'll come back to that later. The tough times are behind me now. I can deal with the bad things that happen. There will always be dark characters. But my life is good. It is as I would want it to be. So, why are you a drunk?
And this innocent child.
Maybe it's the satellite.
Yes.
Who... who are you...?
Hi, Plato!
Ok fine. Tell me about it. Tell me about the future. 2004. What does it look like?
What about the world?
The future doesn't look different?
I heard something like that
Now just a minute...
I - I really cannot do that, Your Excellency. You see, he doesn't know I'm here.
Well...
Not good.
You don't have to.
He's not going tonight.
Is he not going? I booked a flight.
Yeah.
He's gonna miss his flight.
Well you could tell him otherwise. It was good of you to be all this help. But he doesn't want to go tonight.
I told his father he'd be on that flight.
Is he wearing a green cardigan?
I'm going to tell him you said that.
SHUT UP!
She says she wants to MMPH!
No, I'm serious. Give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.
The Food and Drug Administration said Wednesday female deodorant sprays may cause such harmful reactions as blisters, burns and rashes. Although the FDA judges that the reported reactions are not sufficient to justify removal of these products from the market, they are sufficient to warrant the proposed mandatory label warnings.
But Countess...
Why, yes, technically. Jack Kerouac and I came awfully close, but he was afraid of me, I think...
Speakest thou from thy heart?
Faith, here it is. I think it best you marry with this Paris. O, he's a lovely gentleman. I think you are happy in this second match, for it excels your first; or if it did not, your first is dead--or 'twere as good he were as living here and you no use to him.
It's where I live.
O sweet my mother cast me not away. Delay this marriage for a month, a week. Or if you do not make the bridal bed in that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
Nothing?
What's wrong?
Our home, Jim! A kidnapper, a murderer, who knows!
Did you enter Virginia into a beauty contest?
Your daughter's life was just threatened!
A man just called. He asked her everything!
I'm so excited. Yay!
Such a beautiful view.
It's gorgeous. Just my taste. I've never gone out with a guy who brought me a piece of jewelry I liked. Thanks. So let's get going. Long drive.
Oh?
Wow. Um, well... can't you just force yourself awake?
Where is it?
I like you, too.
It was either that, or a sardine.
Thanks.
Eh, I'll call them myself. But I do need your help with something very urgent.
You needn't be concerned about me.
Is this for real? Like for real, for real?
What? The curse'll be lifted? Will you please!
Yes, dear, what is it?
The moron?
Do you want to take a quick swim?
You bled to death.
What do you mean?
What is the scene? Where am I?
Jake, no --
Maybe you're confusing his life with his work.
Is there an ashtray in here?
How are you, Benjamin?
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?
I tell ya the guy's a phony.
Just serve.
I will. Come and kiss me.
Please hurry.
Pump in two liters of pure oxygen, please Henry.
So I can't talk to some broken down actor, what do you think, I'm going to tell him I'm screwing Lester Karpf!
The young man leaned back in his chair. No bulls would die today.
Don't be evasive.
Miss Channing is ageless. Spoken like a press agent.
Spoken like an author. Lloyd, I'm not twentyish. I am not thirtyish. Three months ago, I was forty years old. Forty. Four oh. That slipped out, I hadn't quite made up my mind to admit it. Now I feel as if I'd suddenly taken all my clothes off...
... as young as they want, you mean. And I'm not interested in whether thousands of people think I'm six or six hundred-
Forget about New York, Jeff. I don't want to talk about New York anymore.
I'm always on the phone because you never let me see anybody, I can't even bring my girlfriends over to the house because they might run into you. You're driving me up the wall, Lester. You're even jealous of the dogs. I mean I've gotta have somebody I can talk to.
That's Lila?
Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie.
That's not very logical, Lester.
Where were you?
P-whipped, p-whipped.
Oh my God. You're completely p-whipped.
Well, get on the phone, and get it...
And that's why you're leaving?
Jerry! Do something --
Would you like a drink? It's right beside you...
Harrington.
I'm so sorry... Harrington. Won't you sit down?
I'd like anything Miss Channing played...
I was telling Margo and Lloyd about how often you'd seen the play...
No, thank you. Yes. I've seen every performance.
Would you, really? How sweet-
Okay, so here's what I'll do. I'll go on up to Ted and Rita Daniels -- two of the nicest people you'd ever hope to meet, who spend every single day watching their little girl fight like a dog against this cancer -- I'll tell them we can't help them cause you don't feel like working that hard.
Because I'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.
No--
First you gotta tell me something.
I apologize, sir, I'm having a bad day...
Look who's talking.
There's... there's no need to bring anything dressy... or... I mean -- I didn't know if we'd be eating at any restaurant that have dress codes.
Like popcorn?
Knowing what I know? Enormous gratitude.
"Be patient, be patient"... is that the only advice you can ever come up with?? I've shown more patience than a dozen saints!
Ah, so that's it. To you I'm just a girl.
It's really Fifties. You sort of clash with the world.
Right. I promised my mother.
Give us time.
Peter...
I thought it'd be nicer to eat here.
Oh. Okay, then -- Melvin. Good night.
The dishes?
What?
You usually eat alone?
Cheers.
I don't?
My name's Sondra.
In a few minutes we're gonna be in a room with a killer. That doesn't bother you?
Yes, that's right.
Maybe it's because I live here.
Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1 2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
I'm going to see my parents.
Walter?
...and he's got a negative rating of...
How do you know?
gives her a sympathetic look.
Not for money. With my mother.
looks startled at the outburst.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Rieper. I'm feeling quite fatigued.
We don't want to tire you out, dear.
... I don't get a friggin' phone call. You stroll in here at noon. I got... two people out sick. Ya think I need this? I Do Not Need This!
We have to think this through. We have to be smart. Now is not the time to panic. If we panic now, we're done for. Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us. We're still okay. Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.
If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
Just what is that supposed to mean?
We gotta be inconspicuous. Do you know what that means?
Yes.
So this is all my fault, is it.
Never heard of it.
I know what you mean. After a while they all look the same.
Just a second. It's my ass I'm risking. You better do it my way. These fuckers don't mess around.
On your own land?
Do you live in a house back in wherever.
Make sure.
Look, I really don't know your daughter but...
Feel anything?
Beautiful?
Quit worryin' about Elaine.
I will.
You say you love me and kiss me 'goodbye.'
I'm never going to see you again, am I?
No, you should forget about last night.
You wouldn't come to find me? That makes me never want to come here. But she continues unraveling the turban.
How long have you been watching me?
Well--he's got nothing on me.
I wouldn't know in the day time .
Very weird.
Yeah?
Fine...Maybe I'll come by later.
Who's nobody?
You want to go talk?
She back in Kansas?
Just drive.
Shelly thinks I'd be a good writer.
Honey, is something wrong?
Would you please leave.
Alright honey, just calm down, take a deep breath, and step out of the circle.
I'm willing to take that risk.
Dr. Drumlin, we are talking about what could potentially be the most important discovery in the history of humanity. There are over four hundred billion stars out there --
What if you're wrong? No -- I'll grant you probabilities but as a scientist without all the evidence -- you can't deny the possibility -- and I believe even the remotest possibility of something this profoundly... profound is worth investigation -- and worth taking a few risks.
Then disagree but don't stand in my way!
Too late? Jody, it was an accident.
What didn't you like about her?
And I'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.
Uh oh --
So what's wrong with that?
What were you going to say?
You're not listening --
Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete?
I'm not goin' home tonight... I'm goin' somewhere else... To a girlfriend's house. But, we still have a coupla things to take care of...
Are you my man?
I think you'd make a fine writer, did you ask your Dad?
He won't give it to me.
I'm afraid there are too many other girls around here with seniority over me.
Okay.
Fine.
You are funny. You speak of life as if it were a train you wanted to catch.
You've seen enough.
Yeah, or Saint Anthony. You from the neighborhood?
You don't act like the rest of Gideon's friends. They believe if you are not hard at work, you are hard at sin.
Eve! My understudy...
Of course I knew.
Is it really? I must start wearing a watch, I never do, you know... who read with Miss Caswell? Bill? Lloyd? Well, it couldn't have been Max! Who?
I consider it highly unnatural to allow a girl in an advanced state of pregnancy-
How... how was Miss Caswell?
Come on Buddy, you wouldn't want to got me disbarred now would you?
God, David. Just give it to me!
YOU get lost!
What happened?
Marmite - addicted! Baths - not with other people! Islands. Your handwriting. I could go on all day. My husband. Alm sy nods.
Now.
Now.
What do I love? I love rice pudding, and water, the fish in it, hedgehogs! The gardens at our house in Freshwater - all my secret paths.
Then I'll bet she's real proud of you, huh?
Are you a good cop, John?
You're mom sounds like she's got some smarts.
We're not gonna bet, we're just gonna watch.
Duck!
What is it, John? John?
Does it make it easier to win?
What do you want me to do for you, Mr. Stephens?
It's the truth.
Ssshhhhh, I don't want them to see me.
I know -- I know --
You're not missing much. He's cuckoo.
We were planning to be married right after Christmas.
It's a promise?
That's one thing I won't forget. Where's Macaulay? I ought to be starting.
He's all right.
Sometimes. A little. Only it ain't scairt so much. It's just waitin' an' wonderin'. But when sump'n happens that I got to do sump'n-- --I'll do it.
Yeah. Who are you?
Really. By what right? Six months of part-time screw-ups?
We re both thinking the same thing, right?
That is incredible! You know, I had to sleep with the lights on for a week after seeing that movie.
I always thought it was a more intimate relationship.
I haven't said anything of the sort.
It seems right to us.
Because you are intelligent -- that's why they sent me to you --
Snakes? What do you mean, exactly?
Yes. There are certain punitive measures...
"I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --
Is it over?
Are we having a bad night?
I feel like you're turning me into a VCR.
I don't feel anything. Is it on?
Good luck. That guy's been in there since I got here.
You may not believe this... but there's a part of me that wants more than anything to believe in your God. To believe that we're all here for a purpose, that all this... means something. But it's because that part of me wants it so badly that I'm so stubborn about making sure it isn't just self-delusion. Of course I want to know God if there is one... but it has to be real. Unless I have proof how can I be sure?
Waiting for Luis to call me. He said he'd call tonight. Oh don't be difficult, Patrick.
Stop it. I'm...
What? Oh, I'm...busy.
I felt thoroughly depressed and even quite seriously considered committing suicide. Life seems so much not worth the living, death such an easy way out.
You're not going anywhere. You're 15 years old!!
Am I missing something?
What's wrong with it?
Do I look like I'm naked?
Christ, you're not a fag are you? Because I don't want to be wasting my time.
My tits?
The usual, Barry.
Don t let the girly shit fool you. It'd blow your shorts off.
I don't know... He's a little disgusting... Although some women go for that.
I knew I couldn't trust you. You told me you were taking me home.
What's this?
No. No, I'm afraid papa isn't that much interested. He's too busy rushing off to Philadelphia to make stuffy, old speeches at stuffy, old bankers' meetings. Too busy closing big, important deals I think I will have a drink.
Okay... twenty dollars... When can you...
It's okay, come on upstairs, we have to have a little talk.
My Mommy and Daddy did THAT?
No, this is great.
I don't want, I don't need your help....
Who are you?
No.
Them?
Yes.
Do you remember me from when you lived here?
I'd like to see him. Why don't you bring him down?
It really is lovely. It's in the bathroom.
What's wrong?
Security's locking down the elevators.
I just wanted to come over. You know, say hi. I miss hanging out with you on school nights.
Yeah. Um, I hooked up a whole private adoption thing. These married people in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.
Mercy... is to die quickly. Perhaps even live in the Tower. In time, who knows what can happen, if you can only live.
Yes, I know, dear, but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday. Nine pounds! And there wasn't a thing in the house and then this morning the Community Chest lady came around and
What are you going to be when you grow up, Todd?
How perfect.
Oh my god, look! Is Stacy Himmler going out with Rod Harbaugh?
See, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.
Gregory you'd better take Jacqueline with you tonight.
He better watch out or he'll get AIDS when he date-rapes her.
I'm supposed to stay in my house.
Don't you trust me, Seymour?
These are all valid comments, but I think we should see if the artist has anything to bring to this.
How long does this go on?
Am I a prisoner?
Well, I got the idea when I was doing some research and I discovered that Cook's Chicken used to be called Coon's Chicken, and so I decided to do my project based on this discovery as kind of a comment on racism... and the way racism is whitewashed over in our culture...
Did you actually do this painting?
I'll sign anything you want me to sign, okay?
No.
Do you?
An angel, when she was having one of her headaches.
Did your mother see angels often?
You'll laugh.
I promise I won't laugh. Who told her?
I don't know.
Agnes...
Somebody told her.
Who?
'Really a lot appreciate it...'
I can't help you, sorry. I'm not here to teach remedial reporting.
I give that Trail Blazer five more minutes to show up-- -- five more minutes !
You spend too much time -- much too much worrying about that crap... Oh good.
Jack. Do you need a ride?
My car's in the garage.
Will you at least call and make sure daddy's okay?
Elena. My name's Elena.
On her knees, I have no doubt! Very touching, very Academy-of-Dramatic Arts!
The cynicism you refer to, I acquired the day I discovered I was different from little boys!
Margo Channing has not been exactly a compromise all these years, half the playwrights in the world would give their shirts for that particular compromise!
It strikes me that Eve's disloyalty and ingratitude must be contagious!
I hate it when you talk like this. Go on.
Except I won't have a father anymore.
I used to think he was something, once... I was eighteen, I didn't know any better, and he had something steady to offer.
What will we talk about?
I thought I knew everything about him.
Of course there is. Look -- The Veranda Room -- right there.
What is the matter?
Do you? Do you really?
I came to make peace with you, even if you're the father of lies. I want things to be as they were.
Am I as good as they?
Oh, poor baby. Well you can relax. I have a mission for you.
Hopefully, though she suspects that your decrepit alcoholic father is diddling the maid.
I'm just taking the poor girl under my wing.
Thanks. Nice meeting you.
Maybe. But that's how it works.
Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are unpredictable.
Plus a bonus.
Me? No. Well, in the accident I was injured, but...
Wyatt Earp, I know. I was Beginning to think we'd never Meet. This is fortuitous. That Means lucky.
You want the cake!?
It s good, right?
Say it, Jack...
Oh. Do you think I have a potential as a writer?
Then say it...just say it to me...!
Confused?
I'm quite sure I don't know what you mean.
Oh, is that it!
I can take it.
When could I look round?
Coming.
I'll sign that affidavit.
You already went back to work.
I can't name anybody she does like these days.
Lunch hour. My next class isn't till nine-thirty.
I see. Are you a socialist, Mr. Penfield?
Goodnight. See you home.
Bye.
It doesn't matter, I didn't tell h...
You do?
I'm just trying to get in my house!
He won't let me go in my house!
It wasn't my fault. If I would have known, I would have known.
He won't...
He won't let me in my own house!
Is that what you're worried about? Looking bad at the PTA?
Keep going. We'll tell you when to stop...
It's a kiss... Goodbye...
What happened?
Don't you get it? It's more than that.
Evolution doesn't work that fast. Something pushed that thing to take the leap. We need to find another specimen.
You are defending what you did?
You know, that big-shot down in Cuba with the crazy beard.
You like Castro? I mean -- how do you feel about Castro? BUD What is Castro?
All right. Have a nice Christmas.
To me, it shows part of our history in this country, a time when we were considered inferior, sub-human.
No hiccups, which was good. Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? "Your honor, I object!"
Dad?
This is authentic, not a repro, circa turn of the century.
I thought it was appropiate.
It's all good. You got a hit show, you're gonna need a bank. Plus, I love these old black collectibles.
He's a man of God; he's true to his vows.
Yeah.
Well, that I shouldn't be seen with anybody that collects garbage.
Can I be honest?
Well, I know what my daddy's going to say.
Nothing.
Why?
What'd you do? Snoop all over the place? You had no right. You had no right to go through anything.
If you don't get out of my house right now, I'll call the police.
What? Now you're gonna show me some kind of driver's license?
Hi!
I've been thinking.
Oh!
Tuesday.
Perhaps you best ask, why you wish it. You asked William to teach you manners, philosophy, decorum... as I said, it's completely stupid.
The place to want to be is America. Every English child dreams of it. I dreamt it.
I have. Or there would be twice as many.
June 3rd, God willing, I'll marry your Dad. And then I will be your stepmom. And right now, I'm not looking forward to th...
I still don't see why we're doing this.
And Ryan works at home.
You better not say you missed that.
Alright. Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking.
I'll be your best friend.
The longer the air force hits the Iraqis, the safer it'II be for us when we have to engage.
Come on, you guys... look, this is the little one right here. You can see how it's kind of zigging around.
Annabelle pick up the phone.
That doesn't bother me.
You think this is funny?
I got scared.
Doesn't your lighter work, Mr. Gordon?
I want to thank you.
I am not -- I just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...
God, you're really obsessed...
No, really...
Go ahead...
I think one of us should fuck Josh...
Let me know as soon as you can, Enid. This could be a great thing for you.
I...
Well, yes...
Yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...
I thought we decided that Josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...
No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
...Hello...?
Bye.
I love you.
uh...uh...What is it?
Those sluts!
I'm his pimp. He left with the dancers, didn't he?
What's that mean?
I wasn't waiting for a bus.
Same reason you went: at that hour of the morning you haven't much choice. Besides, I only live three blocks from there. Where do you live?
I know where you live: in a locker, in a bus station. What's it like living in a locker?
Do you always ask so many questions?
Sometimes I wake up and I can't sleep, not without a drink. The bars don't open until eight. Mack over there has faith in me. When I'm broke, he trusts me. Don't you trust me, Mack?
Come on, I don't see you living in a cave!
And I'm sure you thought Columbus was going to sail off the edge of the world!
Was it Venza? Did you get him?
How old is your boy?
It's just money. You should be glad you're alive.
What did you say?
My name's not Christine. It's not my real...
You were ALL human!
It's you! You HAVEN'T always been as you are. You were HUMAN. Remember. Remember all your confusions. Think!
I was being foolish?
Tom, Daddy would like to see you in the garden. And will you ask Betty to bring us some coffee. And remember to say 'please'.
I questioned him for three hours and he didn't make a sound. You don't have a badge, he won't talk to you.
You vanished quite effectively. Became Mister Nobody. And you've no idea how useful that could be.
We had a court-martial in your absence. They wanted to put a bullet in your head. I pleaded for clemency. Said we should find out what happened first. So what did happen?
But you know what the thing is, Fergus?
So you did fuck up.
Why don't you shut up now.
Yeah. I'm probably not going to be around next time it comes.
You've been neglecting the farm, Uncle.
I hope so. I think maybe she sees me now.
Looking for something -- someone.
Don't you want to hear about my day?
I don't care about the money. I just want to work again. You don't know what it means to know that you want me.
Yes.
Did you see them? Did you see how they came?
Nothing. I just didn't realize what it would be like to come back to the old studio. I had no idea how I'd missed it.
We'll be working again, won't we, Chief? We'll make our greatest picture.
It's a good script, isn't it?
Besides being very rude.
And you no longer play at all?
Oh no, it's been much more than that.
I don't think that's true.
Take a good look at him, Dad. Now please try to remember him... 'cause he's going to be your son- in-law.
To tell you the truth, not very much. I cannot lie. I respect you and I am grateful to you because I owe you everything materially, but otherwise ...
Just a teensie one ninety-nine, six. She'll be all right.
Where're you going?
From their heads...
Yeah, I'm sure.
I want you to come with me.
Come with me to California.
Charles, this - this story - doesn't concern only you. I'll be in it, too, won't I? And Junior?
You're a bastard.
You may kiss my hand.
I'm not afraid...I'm not afraid.
I'm sort of curious... if you're willing to pay me two-fifty... not that I mind... I mean, I'm OK with that -- why aren't you staying in a hotel?
No -- S.E.R.A.
My first husband worked for the BBC. I doubt if anyone there remembers him now, just another long dead diligent administrator. He would have been useful in the fight to preserve the BBC's independence during the Suez crisis - one of the few things he was passionate about. I became involved too. I started work on a book that would have been published on the tenth anniversary of Suez. Then he died, and I loots the will to write it. By the time I was over his death, other books had been published, and it wasn't worth going on.
Umm. We can stay in the car for an hour if you want. But I really have to go then. It's your time.
Hey, wait, where's Bee-Bee? Bee-Bee! Bee-Bee, where'd you go? Did you guys see where she went?
She's dying and Rache is your mother now!
YOU'RE WORSE THAN SHE IS! WHY DON'T YOU JUST DIE, TOO?
You got everything right but the car. My dad didn't get me a BMW.
This is the most amusing thing I have ever heard and with a bit of gossip to season it your failure with Jacqueline. Has she returned to her husband?
But you have never liked Jason. You always laughed at him - -quarreled with him --
This is incredible I It must be some sort of a joke.
You're even sentimental about it. What made you change your mind?
Wow!
Where'd he go? What's goin' on?
I need to know.
I'm married.
If I weren't married?
Okay. Well, you know, he's always been a nice guy and I like him.
Talk to us about it...
Isn't this a wonderful piece, class? This definitely falls into that higher category of art I was speaking of earlier.
No, I'm sure it won't. Move over there. Let's make believe nothing happened. And when we get to the next station, get off.
For me they are exactly as they were when we met three days ago -- just three days ago... don't you realize? And you and Anna... No, I guess they aren't like that any more. My God, is it possible to forget in such a short time, for things to change so quickly?
But it's so sad. So terribly sad. I'm not used to it, I'm not ready for it... You know... I have never been so upset in my life. Sandro, why don't you help me?
But sooner or later we've got to end this relationship. And it's better to do it right now.
Oh, Sandro...
I... I'll get the grits.
No, ma'am, I'm just fine.
Oh, I don't know, I... I...
No! And I don't need a psychiatrist!
That's your fault not mine.
So it's ok if I bring her.
She's really cute and she's really nice.
....wait a minute: why is this about you now? Why is it always about you?
I'm trying to be your friend.
You can drink like there's no tomorrow but you still can't get that sperm between the teeth out. It's so disgusting.
It was... it was.
No, no, no. You can't get that taste out of your mouth. Until you eat something.
...Maybe I should just move in here with you... I could do all the cooking and dust your record collection and stuff until I get a job.
I dunno... I always feel like everybody secretly hates me. I'm just paranoid I guess. I mean, you like me don't you? We're good friends, right?
Yeah, but still... it's kind of insulting for a girl to be ignored like that.
How come in all that time I was trying to get you a date, you never asked me out?
At least you're not like every other stupid guy in the world - all they care about are guitars and sports... they're all such fags!
What happened?
Maybe because we're not supposed to be having sex with bananas.
How clover you are, Mr. Albrecht, to see all that in our simple Thea... She is quite pretty, isn't she?
How disappointing! I expected it was something more romantic. A temple to the Goddess of Love, perhaps.
Yeah, that's good too... the whole record was good, but that one song, "Devil Got My Woman" -- I mostly just keep playing that one over and over... Do you have any other records like that?
He's done it before. Other countries. Lumumba in the Congo, Trujillo, the Dominican Republic, he's working on Castro. No big deal. In September, Kennedy announces the Texas trip. At that moment, second Oswalds start popping up all over Dallas where they have the mayor and the cops in their pocket. Y flies in the assassins, maybe from the special camp we keep outside Athens, Greece - pros, maybe some locals, Cubans, Maria hire, separate teams. Does it really matter who shot from what rooftop? Part of the scenery. The assassins by now are dead or well paid and long gone...
...don't think so. When they start to drool, they get rid of 'em. These guys are proud of what they did. They did Dealey Plaza! They took out the President of the United States! That's entertainment! And they served their country doing it.
Uh, hi Su-Chin.
You should try Adderall.
Wise move. I know this girl who had a huge crazy freakout because she took too many behavioral meds at once. She took off her clothes and jumped into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall and she was like, "Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!"
Well, it was nice seeing you.
I only have something like sixteen weeks.
Dad, this is what I really wanted to ask you....
Other than me.
It's how he works.
Yes.
I take a straight 15 percent. Brill's fee varies with risk. Perhaps you'd be more comfortable using someone else.
It was a long time ago... I met someone at this place called Moke's... we became friends. He told me about a job...
No... A job... I didn't know what. He set up an appointment for me to see a man.
Yeah.
Pete... Don't...
What's this?
Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
I know your parents.
Did you tell them? That we were coming?
Orchids come again, Madam -- no card -- I think perhaps they are from the same young man -- he is at the end of the corridor -- tall -- he walks like a soldier -- Madam must have noticed how often he is in the elevator with us. Last night for instance --
Oh, Suzette -- Suzette -- Sshh -- quiet.
Ah, oui -- the car is here for Madam.
Send it away -- I shan't need it.
Now is the time to cancel to stop entirely. I feel it -- everything tells me -- enough -- enough.
Long distance? I wouldn't do that to you. I'd at least talk to you.
Mon Dieu -- the pearls -- if they were to break --
The pearls won't break -- they hold together and bring me bad luck ---- I hate them!
No thanks -
And the new label? And the Kinky Wizards?
Who gets contaminated, the Jews or the gentiles?
If I think of myself it's because you never think of me. Never. Never. Never...
What kind?
I'm not disturbed. By you.
Madam should sleep.
Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold?
I love you! I love you!
You really want to know, sir?
It's their country. This is one of the best deals they offer.
I mean, follow orders, sir.
Really? That's a very good book. It'd make a terrific --
I do, sir.
Tell them to go!
No!
And what do you think you might have said?
You didn't happen to call the house last night, did you, Grady?
It's within the realm. He takes his souvenirs pretty seriously. And he was just a wee bit prickly this morning.
He told me.
Why? What's wrong?
But what's wrong?
What is?
But they must be! They cut glass!
It was a gift. It isn't worth anything at all?
Must be nice for you to take a few days off from your work, huh?
I have their past.
Yes, we sat together at Bell's Square.
Well, what's the difference, anyway?
Because I find you very attractive and any time --
Yes. Things are pretty hectic right now, but thanks.
You!
Because they get outstanding settlements. And Mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.
If you really want to help me, there's one thing you can do.
Forgive me. I've never read the Navy manual. I wonder what it says about bathroom and shower procedures.
Yeah. I heard you.
Wow, you walked out with my mother?
Umm, I'm trying to find out her greatest achievement.
What do you remember about her.
Suspended from school, my mother??
He's already got one mother, he doesn't need two...He's yours... I won't fight you for him any more. He's yours...
Funny, very funny.
What if they're dangerous?
Why don't you just let me go, Sam?
They asked.
I said I wanted to talk to a lawyer.
Beaumont Livingston.
And they asked if I knew Mr. Walker.
Oh, sh-
Fuck you.
I w- I was gonna be back before she woke up.
After I left...when I was in California, I began to think, what kind of mother was I that I could walk out on my own child. It got to where I couldn't tell anybody about Billy--I couldn't stand that look in their faces when I said he wasn't living with me. Finally it seemed like the most important thing in the world to come back here and prove to Billy and to me and to the world how much I loved him...And I did ...And I won. Only...it was just another "should." ...Sitting in that courtroom. Hearing everything you did, everything you went through... Something happened. I guess it doesn't matter how much I love him, or how much you love him. I guess it's like you said, the only thing that counts is what's best for Billy. I don't know, maybe that's all love is anyway... Ted, I think Billy should stay with you...
They can't be.
Who are you?
I mean, you've been married before, you know how things can get. You were very hot for Allison at first.
I know. Well, Alvy, it'll pass, it'll pass, it's just that I'm going through a phase, that's all.
I know, well, it's just that- you know, I mean, I-I-I-I gotta sing tomorrow night, so I have to rest my voice.
Yeah, and you look at people and you wonder who the hell they are, what's going on inside their heads. Sometimes you can hear it, like a buzzing, the things that happen in their heads. And you wonder: does anybody ever love anybody, really?
Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher.
Well... to get a crack at something good, you gotta earn it, you gotta climb the ladder first. So you do, you work hard, and all these people behind you are pushing you up, shouting you on. And then one day you realize you are, you're at the top... and there's nothing there. And you look behind you and there's no one below. You're just left there all alone... swaying in the god-damned breeze.
I trusted you! I thought you cared about me?!
More bullshit! More bullshit! What kind of odds are they giving me? There must be some kind of office pool. One month? A couple of days?
Phil's moving to LA, Grammoo's passing, the baby being born, Vada's report, I think...
But... it didn't just get there by itself.
Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about.
You don't really think so?
I think it's beginning to dawn on Mr. Rogers that I mean what I say. With Mr. Rogers out of the way, Reilly, I think we may really begin to hope for a good government in this state. Well, Mr. Bernstein?
How can I tell? You've seen both of me. I only know what you're like here. You're all I know. There is no "You" from before.
How could it be so cruel? How could it torture us like this?
Please, Mr. Bernstein.
You're a cop - you'll never believe me.
I'm from a small town in Slovakia. Like the South here. The Police is right, a civilian is wrong. So I fled.
Yes, but he was a cop.
I do. I just said that. I was never here before. I actually like it.
This afternoon, about four, five o'clock.
John, I'm sure she could support just about anything. I think I'll see you to your room. A sort of bodyguard. Make sure no harm comes to you.
My son Thomas came to see you this afternoon, and he said to you he wants to cast his mother from his house?
A shot of tequila, if you can spare it.
What's the story? Are you too drunk to come?
OK... whatever.
Do you want to fuck now?
Congratulations.
You'll be all right?
Like all the rest of us. Has this fellow... ...has he seen the whole family?
It is true. You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone.
You want to talk about bullshit? Lucy called you three times this week. She's a fucking mess, Joe. Your sister is a fucking mess. She needs you. I talk to her more than you do.
You've been through it. That's how you love people. When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.
And how hard it hit?
It's not like this all the time.
You don't ever think about other people?
Jesus. I do not know. I'll talk to you later.
I'm not experimenting. Why don't you go experiment.
I'm not -- hold on...
You smell like baby powder.
I never felt so clean before.
I love somebody. All the time I've been looking for someone to love me and now--I love somebody. And it's so easy. Why is it easy now?
I love you, Jim. I really mean it.
You are now required to sit here with me. Come on...be smart for a second -- what do you think will happen to us?
You already know the answer to that. I want this town to be safe and happy again --
Pris.
Didn't you take your cut out of the closing check?
I was tired and didn't have any place to go.
I -- I bought some silver jewelry and stuff from Eloise --
You're just trying to say all great stuff so I'll feel even worse that you're not around.
And he still wants to marry me!
I got to see my husband, Sheriff Young!
Oh you know, for a minute I thought it was --
He's probably been waiting all night at the station.
Once this was a relationship based on love. Now you have me in a cage with a monkey and a gun to my head.
You fell in love with her first.
What can it hurt.
You didn't do anything about it out of respect for the fact that she wouldn't let you near her with a ten foot pole, which is, by the way, about nine feet, nine inches off the mark anyway.
What's wrong?
Stephen... I... can I talk to you a second...
-- No, that's okay. It's just Sean...
No, really.
He thinks it's too...
Mr. President, this is St...
But, Victor, if the situation were different, if I had to stay and there were only a visa for one, would you take it?
Yes, I see. When I had trouble getting out of Lille, why didn't you leave me there? And when I was sick in Marseilles and held you up for two weeks and you were in danger every minute of the time, why didn't you leave me then?
No, Victor, no.
And I'd end up a widow in two ways. Let's forget it. I'll just be a little more careful next time.
We're a big hit.
Really -- You don't think they're overly feminine?
Don't want weak legs.
-- The legs.
I thought it might be cute.
I made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first. Children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.
Where is my Lady's lord?
You got two shirts on?
Your ranch?
He's asleep, right?
Still going.
He does?
And for cleaning up oil spills.
His journal. He sent it to me the day before he died. Everything about you is in it. The blow jobs, the hand jobs, the menages, your bout with bulimia, the affair you had with your guidance counselor and how he gave you... eww. Let's see, then there's your coke problem... You still keep it in your crucifix, don't you? It's all in there.
You what?
I know.
Actually, I was planning on running down to Kinkos. Do you think you could give me ride?
So what did you do?
Listen, Stace, you want to know about guys? I'll tell you. They're mostly chicken. Before I met Doug I chased after every guy I thought was cute. I thought if I gave out a vibe they'd get the message and call me up. Well, guess what? They don't call.
He gave me his card. 'Ron Johnson, Audio Consultant.'
Come on, Linda, I haven't had a boyfriend all summer. You promised when I started working at the mall that my life would change... Do you think he'll call this week?
Should we buy a frame for that?
Yeah. She is. But you know what? That's why I'm helping her. So she can get some medicine to make her feel better.
Cause her own mom's real sick, too.
I'd better get back. Say goodbye here.
I just know - any minute he'll find out, we'll barge into somebody we'll - and it will ill him.
You will. You will.
Where are you goin', Karl? Didn't you want some chicken and things?
Well, okay. I got you some.
Lemme call him now. Make sure he's not already busy tomorrow night.
Set.
'Cause that's how long it's gonna take, baby.
I just, I just -- I just -- I'm just in a fucking state, I know he's going and it's like I don't know how -- just tell me practical things -- What the fuck do I do with his body? What happens when he dies? That next moment: What? What do I do? Then What?
He has Phil right now.
No, leave it. I'll do it later. Listen, maybe you and Floyd can come for dinner on Saturday. I'm sure Richard'll have so many stories to tell you both about the fair and all.
I'm cancelling the engagement.
The house is not full -- Is it really full?
Oh -- but it can't be.
All right, Suzette -- quickly -- hurry.
Oh, come, Madam -- please come.
Llewelyn?
What should I do?
Sounds good - thank you
Quick -- something awful -- awful has happened. Go -- go at once, -- Mr. Preysing --
Quick -- Mr. Kringelein.
Shouldn't somebody take him a blanket or something?
Don't lie to me. I saw her name in the register.
You're livin' in Edina, then?
Nicholas...
I'm not enough for a paragraph.
I'd love to! Or should I pretend I'm busy?
Even so. One isolated pretty good performance by an understudy. It'll be forgotten tomorrow.
I want to fly it! Can I fly it now, mommy!
...This is a nice place.
In a minute, hon. Let Gage finish his turn.
Will he understand Spanish?
Sabotage?
Well, you were pretty great!
Jack, I --
We held each other. It was better than sex. What I need he gave me great.
To hell with sex.
You heard what Abbott said?
Who's been talking to you about what I'm feeling? Who should care about what I'm feeling?
Yes. Abbot understands these things.
That's so perfectly...It really makes me feel a little faint... Whooo.
It's started.
What was the bribe? What am I worth to you?
I'm sorry but I have to go.
Prob'ly waiting by the phone for Outpost to call. We'll leave it for him?
You can't go now.
Are you okay?
Norville!
I'd never do that.
You really should go in, it's marvelous.
Why?
What the hell is going on?
I'll have a spritzer, order something soft for yourself... I must go for a pee.
I think I can probably do that on my own.
Hell no, the cranes are wonderful, okay, but I'm not in this for whooping cranes. I'm in it for cowgirls. If we cowgirls give in to authority on this crane issue, then cowgirls become just another compromise. I want a finer fate than that -- for me and for every other cowgirl. Better no cowgirls at all than cowgirls compromised.
How did this business get started, anyhow? Why are the birds nesting here?
'Drugged' is a stupid word.
No. Laudanum.
He said he was dissatisfied... and was going back.
Go out there! Find somebody, ask some questions! I'm sorry if I seem over-anxious to you. I keep thinking... something's wrong. I have to know what!
He didn't mention the money. What he said on the phone isn't important, is it? He was supposed to come back after he spoke to the mother, and he didn't! That's what I want you to do something about!
Mary had been there, one night, and had left.
So you just want to cross into hostile territory in the middle of a war on a wild goose chase? It's crazy. Tell him it's crazy, Epps.
Before they were married?
I knew he slept in a toolshed.
So how's tricks? Sorry, occupational humor.
Oh, I'm sorry. Does my line of work make you uncomfortable, precious?
And what about you?
But I didn't open it! I didn't!
I've come for my father!
I got a bad feelin', Llewelyn.
You can't afford one?
Promise?
Why all the way to Del Rio?
So you fucked around to prove a point!
Cosmo, this is Ronny, Johnny's brother.
I don't know.
Where's Adele?
Here, drink this. I'll get the heat going.
Ronny, please...
I'm only asking because it's a dangerous building. There's been some robberies, a woman was raped not long ago. This woman I'm seeing, she'll want to talk to me all day, but if I can point to you out the window and say you're waiting, I can be out quick. if anything happens, I'll be in apartment 16M.
I'll have to talk to the driver.
Don't say that. I wanted to cut my father loose too. They told me he almost died and five minutes later they say he's better and I go in. It's killing me seeing him fighting like that. Look, since you're here, maybe you could do me a favor. I need you to wait for me outside this building, okay? I have to visit a friend who's sick.
Who... Who is that?
That's the experiment? Dumping a guy into a frozen lake?
Do you really think I should go to the commune?
Sure you don't want to come with me?
I sure hate to go alone...
You don't have to.
What do you mean?
I just wanted some make-up.
Yeah. I know I did. But... I'm tryin' to be dif'rent. I'm tryin' to... get some peace, you know?
Now see? Don't do that. I'll go along with all you say about me. But that... you can't pretend no more on that. Cuz I was just a kid, Momma. I didn't know about any of that stuff he was doin' to me. And you let him do it. Some big nobody in your life... and you let him do as he wanted... with the only SOMEBODY you had.
I'm sorry... I didn't mean to shout...
Thank you.
What do you think we're doing, dad?
I don't know. I think he's cryin'!
It's a lovely town - it was until we came and let the leopard loose and all this happened.
What's the matter with him?
Well, wait now. I still have to ask Darryl if I can go.
Yes--right here. Just a second-- Miss Paine.
Yes you do....you do and you won't say.
...Jimmy...
But you can't say....
Did you ever touch her?
Get your hat, Senator. We've got a lot to do between now and tomorrow--
So you don't do any of those things.
Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor.
Early Grayce if this ain't your lucky day.
The Mitchell barbecue three years ago.
I just...
And...she's not an Illegal Immigrant? Is she? Can I see her "chart?" Because...
Oh, MiGod.
Are you dictating my position to me? We're getting into some sticky legal territories here.
Eve, she strangled a baby!
What about Roger? He's free.
On his back, I suppose.
Lloyd was such a gentleman. He was funny and nervous and strange, and I met people that I never would have met before, then I blew it. I called him basic. Can you believe I did that?
Then call me later.
Dad, I'm so glad I went. Goodnight.
This.
That's fine! That's fine! Now fall right into their laps. Go ahead. Say John Doe walked in and called the whole thing off. You know what that's going to sound like on top of this!
This . . .
John! I'm so glad to see you. I I was terribly worried.
You're supposed to be a smart guy! If it was raining hundred dollar bills, you'd be out looking for a dime you lost some place.
Now the bitch was getting personal.
Okay, let's just slow down. Pull up the starfield signal origin.
Did I say that?
Bobbie, please.
And how's your bill, Senator?
Right, I guess those are the kids --
To make you feel better.
Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.
Look, we're okay now. We just had a nice time. Let's leave it at that.
What's the difference?
It was like sex. What else could it be like?
We need you too!
Open your eyes, you can face death 24 hours a day; but the possibility of betrayal never enters your mind. If you won't do that for yourself do it for us.
Do you have other things?
Oh. Well, please sit down.
We... don't usually let people smoke in the house. We have a patio if you --
That was quick.
How far can you stretch?
If you start in on the war metaphors I'm going to drive this car into a fucking telephone pole.
Are you kidding? You're not kidding? You're not kidding!
Parrots can do as much, Mr. Treves. It's all very nice, but I don't see the point. You know they won't let him stay here.
Good Lord, Mr. Treves!
No, I was, I was, I was just learning on, it's a...
So there goes your theory about the Joes giving up Shu to protect their trigger man.
I've phoned every art supply retailer and wholesaler in the Tri-state area. No one's heard of Chuckie Roeder.
On that one is beautiful. Look at their expressions. As if the camera weren't on them at all. As if they had no strength left to hide what they were feeling.
I'm just going to my car?
Don't let me dis...I'll just...
Do you have any pictures if her?
She's beautiful.
Give Eve Harrington job in you office.
You get quick action, don't you?
You said yourself my inventory was in good shape - all of my merchandise put away. To keep her here with nothing to do - I'd be standing in her way... and you need her, Max.
She'd be a great help - read scripts, interview people you have to see, get rid of the ones you don't have to... you'd be a man of leisure-
Think of your health, Max - more time to relax out in the fresh air at a race track...
Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
No.
Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
What? No!
This is empty, just coming!
Yes, Mr. Gittes?
Why?... What on earth for? Look, Hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.
What do you mean?
Hi, Mr. Ansel. Hi, Jessica, Mason...
He don't want to Doyle. Don't go Vaughan if you don't want to. You'll wreck Doyle, you're drunk.
You're a great date. I've never really gone out with someone as basic as you.
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you.
So you're still breast-feeding?
But you still have a choice. The others never had a chance to see their future. You did.
Shut up!
Yes, Tom Ripley's here.
Well, we ate everything without you.
You just woke up!
Eve. Eve Harrington.
You've already met.
This is Eve Harrington.
Heaven help me, I love a psychotic.
Right here. A minute ago.
How do you do?
For Heaven's sakes!
Not at all.
That man is your father.
There stands the loins from which you've sprung.
Yeah?
I don't -
Okay.
Mm-hm.
Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
...I don't know what you mean....
Was a time I knew what was.
I want you to do something for me.
I just have to get something. I'll be right back.
Would you sign it for me?
I'm scared, Mr. M. I kind of don't feel ready for college.
Take as much room as you want
I hope so
No.
You know about it?
Yeah. I had uhm--school business.
I think I better. Between the book and the coffee, I'm this close to raping the busboy.
Boy. All these years I've resented not living the wild life in some place like Paris and all the time I could've moved back to Iowa... Are you drunk?
Talk to your new girlfriend.
You mean -- she didn't like sex?
And the egyptian cotton shirt that works with or without the jacket. Tell me again, how was it left with Cush?
Yeah. But I thought she died.
Relax, okay? You don't have to do anything. Just go in there and pretend. It won't kill you to do a little favor like that. Besides, you might even learn something.
Have you called Betty? Maybe you should.
A certain weakness.
It should. You nominated him for Spec-Recon just three days after you nominated me.
Jordan. Might we do this over lunch tomorrow? I do very much want to talk, but now is scarcely --
Did you set me up? Did you set me up just to see me fail?
Absolutely not.
Jordan. I always hoped we'd get together -- though just now I'm gearing up for a child-care vote that --
Lieutenant Thomas Wickwire.
You know him.
Sounds familiar.
Wickwire was there to help. To be my eyes on the inside, to make sure you were getting a fair shot. At least that was the intent.
Are you in a bad mood?
Yes. I know. The last few weeks, you haven't been yourself. And tonight at, tonight at dinner, you, you were kind of curt with me.
Yes, you were. A-and when I, when I brought up the idea of having a baby, you just, you jumped down my throat.
Water... Nobody told you it might be a good idea to remove the carpeting and drapes in Spencer's room?
Do you want some juice or coffee or two female slaves?
No.
They're considerable. But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.
Doc!!! So listen, you gotta let me know about the additional costs -- one way or the other we'll...
Please don't lie. I told you before, I don't know how I came to be here. Whatever you think you can't say to me, I need to hear you say it.
Pants.
Fine, you don't like this one, which one would you rather wear?
The blue.
I just need to lay down. I've been running around all day.
Do you want to talk about it?
Tod was. He was with Ratan.
He deals in pain.
Tijuana.
Hey Bleek.
For what?
Fine. One.
I'm too tired for this now. I know I'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so I can get my stuff packed up? I need to be able to think while I do it and I can't think while you're here.
Copy that.
Okay.
I remember when I first started reading these I thought DWF stood for "dwarf!"
You're better at it.
Why do I always have to do it?
You call.
Oh yeah.
You know, the green cardigan guy.
Which loser?
Hey! We forgot to call the loser!
Fuck you!
That Larry guy -- what look was he going for? A gay tennis player from the forties?
... he tried to... uh... make it with me.
No stop where he's all besieged.
Right there, Bobbie.
Yes.
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.
Well, that's out. Either it's lots of reporters and lots of tickets or--. Now will you go and call 'em before I change my mind about the whole thing!
The leadership of our district... the diener. Bishop Tschantz is the one with no hair on top. They decided to come and see you for themselves. Except Stoltzfus, of course. He came the first day. I think he saved your life.
Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann-- he's bound to move right in--get him out of the way first-- Pardon me, friend--I've got some telephoning to do--!
Get my whole fall outfit--and quit this job in style!
I got the good chocolate, Alvy.
Would you like a glass of chocolate milk?
Alvy, you're a little hostile, you know that? Not only that, you look thin and tired.
Well, I like to try to get all points of view.
In the car.
Just watching you.
I keep feeling like I'm forgetting something.
Is that a promise, then?
It couldn't be me. I hardly knew him.
You were terrific. And I kept trying to push you away but you wouldn't give up.
Charlie, I had a strange experience. I went back to high school. And I spent a lot of time with you. And you and Walter and Leon were singing "I Wonder Why".
Then hold me.
I just stopped in to say hi.
I don't know -- I was shocked. Why did you do that?
You did that for me, and on the last day of your holidays?
Thank you Billy, from the baby and me.
Now take deep breaths, and push.
Why? It's coming on its own. It doesn't hurt.
Absolutely -- What time should I expect you?
Yes.
What?
I'm finished.
You want to crawl, crawl.
And you?
Hi.
I was told you were in a fight.
John?
Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. Do I make myself clear?
I'll go see how he's doing.
I declare, you'll let that money haunt you to your grave, Willa Harper!
You'll come right out and ask that Man of God! Mr. Paow-well! Clear that evil mud out of your soul!
What he needs is a dose o' salts!
What?
Nothing's going on. Maybe he doesn't want to be alone. He's go- ing to be sixty-five in a minute --
Work.
Please, I'll see you later this evening.
I'm not easily shocked.
Something happened to you.
What?
You're damaged.
I'm sorry everything's been so confusing, but I have to go, Robert...
I don't.
For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
Um...I'd rather not say...just yet.
Aren't you?
Hello. Get me the police, please.
Craig, everyone can't be Derek Mantini. Well, grub worms are waiting. Do me a favor?
Gotta run. Shipment of grub worms coming in first thing.
Well, you know, maybe something else until this whole puppet thing turns around.
Craig, listen, honey, I've been thinking... maybe you'd feel better if you got, you know, a job or something.
Oh, is that what it is?
Oh!
Caesar, don't.
Wow, it's the red one?
Oh, it's magnificent!
It's terrific!
Uh-huh.
Yes mother.
You're wearing your suit --
You always say that -- then you leave.
It's so--so stark.
Yes... We were discussing Mister Harding's problem with his wife. Now, who will start? Billy.
Mister McMurphy, this ward is a democratic community run by the patients and their votes, so you should feel at ease in your new surroundings to the extent you can freely discuss emotional problems in front of the patients and staff. However, the cardinal rule, and I must emphasize this: Everyone keeps their seat during the meeting!
He also thinks he may have given her reason to seek sexual attention elsewhere, but he didn't say how. He has been heard to say to his wife, 'I hate you, I don't ever want to see you again. You've betrayed me.' So. Does anyone care to touch upon this further?
At the close of Friday's meeting, we were discussing Mister Harding's problem, concerning his wife... Mister Harding stated that his wife made him uneasy because she drew stares from men on the street. Is that correct, Mister Harding?
Wouldn't bother me... I wouldn't try it in front of pa, though, was I you...
Ain't worth the mendin'...
I wish she hadn't.
Hi.
Nice to meet you Sooze. Hi, I'm Erica.
Hi, I'm Erica.
Hey, I'm Sooze.
Fine. Grandma, would you teach me how to make strudel?
We want it back.
Only can I still see him?
So is finishing my residency and passing my boards ...
She's only 12. Some day she'll understand that apathy and absence are just special ways of saying "I love you."
Jon ... we just remember how it used to be. You staying for a while or is this just a piss-stop?
I'm late for surgery.
You're damn right I am.
We'll get a ride in the morning.
Let's find a place out of the rain. I'm sure we'll get a ride in the morning.
Why don't you send one of your radio balloons and tell your captain that you might be late?
Hair and make-up?
Well, something has to be done about this budget. It's completely unrealistic. You allowed nothing for limousine service.
Ok, ok. I'm back.
Thank you.
Goodnight, Rocky.
Do you want me to get it?
I'm going to go and eat tomorrow night do you want to go with me?
Call me later.
Ok.
So I'll meet you at the restaraunt?
Are you ready?
Bye, Barry.
Will you call me later to talk about asking Walter for the shrink? And we can talk about - he said you have this crying problem or something?
Now your father may seem sleepy to you, but that's just because of his medicine, okay?
It's a long story, this one.
Must I administer them directly, or might I blow them?
Oh, you. You talk same as you write.
Yeah, honey, someday everything's gonna be all right.
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
Is he circumcised? Can you imagine what his anus is like? Describe it to me. Would you like to sodomize him? Would you like to put your penis right into his anus, thrust it up his anus? Tell me, describe it to me. Tell me what you would do. How would you kiss him in that car? Describe how you'd reach over and unzip his greasy jeans, then take out his penis. Would you kiss it or suck it right away? Which hand would you hold it in? Have you ever sucked a penis? Do you know what semen tastes like? Have you ever tasted semen? Some semen is saltier than others. Vaughan's semen must be very salty...
Do you find him attractive?
Have you seen his penis?
Would you like to tuck him, though? In that car?
I would like to go now, please.
They don't feel like you're in construction.
What do you do?
Milo? What if Shrot notices somebody entered the Day Care at four A.M.? And tells them about it?
God, I hate that time. That pick up stuff time. I just went through that before I came here. You know that song "Patsy Cline Times Two" I play? That's about me and my ex dividing up our record collections.
Will you please just go?
No. I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love. Not yet. But I'll tell you one thing. The sleeping together is better.
Everything go alright?
Big Sid came in about two and a half seconds, then had the nerve to ask, 'Did you make it, too, sweetheart?'
How did it go with you guys?
He ask you out for next weekend?
I told Zack about Saturday night, too. The fifth week's supposed to be the roughest. Come Wednesday, he'll be wishing he took my number.
No, but I told him I'd be at the Town Tavern next Saturday night, and he sounded like he might come.
He'll show. I'd bet my paycheck on it.
You hope.
They were early.
Fuck you. When you needed information, I got it. You didn't care how.
When I get the Scotch, how do I know you won't take off?
Not Caesar.
I still don't see how I'm going to get clean with the money in the apartment. Everyone will think I did it.
Why?
C! Shit, I'm sorry!
We're screwed.
This is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...
Just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.
Unless they're in your Summer school class!
Shut up!
Why?
Remember that stupid hippie art teacher who failed me sophomore year? I didn't think that just because you get an "F" that means you have to take the class over again.
You loser.
This is so bad, it's almost good.
Uh oh... don't turn around...
No. That's what I mean - I'm being fired for what I didn't do.
What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing...
Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous.
Muncie!
You're fools, both of you! It's obvious they're out to crucify Norville! They're trying to destroy him!
Let me hold him.
And this is legitimate therapy?
Mom, sit down for a minute. This is so nice, all of us being together again like this.
I know, look at his little hands.
He's so tiny.
I was pushing as fast as I could.
You have no idea.
You're shaking.
But now that I am here, will you speak with a woman?
But you never had a chance to prove yourself.
Ohh!
Hello.
Come on, get ready. It's important.
I come as the king's servant, and with his authority.
You don't know what you're fucking with here.
Then what? Then what, Lenny?! You going to protect me? Big tough guy. You're a talker, Lenny. You don't even have a gun.
So did you get his autograph?
I thought he was dead.
Boy, I can't even remember the last time he was in a picture.
Boris Karloff!?
You met Basil Rathbone!
Connie's gone. Lit out this e'enin'--said he didn't know it was gonna be like this.
Andy, the theater's that way!
He was murdered.
You're shocked at the thought of Eduard tossing a bomb through a window.
Lookit that, up already.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Thank you, Sergeant Major.
Reasonable? Reasonable? Jake ... You're gettin' me angry.
Oh yeah? Try leavin' without me.
Oh, I see, I see.
So my lord? I speak with him every day.
My lord.
How did you get here?
'Cause she's always on your mind.
What for?
....now that I've met you.... Would you object to never seeing me again?
Something serious has happened.
Come with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right?
We have to tell Mother and Cal.
David Lee, it's time for you to get to bed!
Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.
Three twenty-five.
Easy, tiger. Come by after school. I'll leave Darryl with the sitter.
I don't know. Excessive masturbation?
Could you have ruined yourself somehow?
This is the second opinion.
How long was I gone?
Peter... What is going on? Has everyone gone completely insane?
Something came up. C'mon Ben! I've got a shoot at three...
No. I'm doing it behind her back.
Listen... will you listen to me for a second!? You're for the suit on and you're a better swimmer than me. Right? So I got a plan...
Wanda does these photographic things. That's one of her pictures on the wall.
Okay, look, you swim to the rig and come back with another suit.
NO!! Now be logical, Bud, you're--
No gas.
This car runs on gas.
What are you doing?
You're full of tricks, aren't you?
'Is it really me?'
-- This play means a lot to me.
He also happens to be the most talented man I've ever known.
It's an anti-Christian dogma! I cannot believe you are so calm about it!
Did you know that Jefferson has proposed a law in Virginia aiming at an absolute separation of state from the church?
Virginia is outraged with your order allowing Negroes to fight in the army. There's a deep feeling of hurt and betrayal. They wanted you commander because they expected you would look out for our interests.
Well, I wouldn't want to trouble you with this now.
Oh, indeed? You know very well people are frightened of arming the Negroes! They beg you to consider the future. What good is a revolution if it overturns those things we cherish!?
But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
I want to touch you.
Graham...
They're smart. Been to college. They moved here from the city about a dozen years ago.
Telly says was up.
Patrizia... Patrizia ... Where's Ettore?
I imagine he must be inside sleeping.
Tell me once more.
I deserve it.
What was my mission? To help my country? But how could I do that? I was only a poor girl who knew nothing about riding or making war... so I decided to wait and not to speak to anyone about it.
And don't wake up Josie Mae and Earl!
Crafts.
And he's the real thing. Specializes in cases like this, like yours.
Well I guess the question is this: Do you remember Miss Simms?
Well, the paper'll have to learn to do without me. And so will you. It just didn't work out, Walter.
Listen, Walter --
You -- you --
I wasn't satisfied! I suppose I proposed to you!
Where you gonna be?
Right.
I'm doing alright.
Yeah?
No, wait! At least stay for dinner!
You haven't been lurking outside my building all day.
I only did it once and...
Come on. Don't cry. We'll work it out.
It's a three-act story with a tragic end.
All right, then.
Let's go upstairs, Deborah. I wrote the last 10 pages of my opera last night.
I think she knows what's going to happen . . . she doesn't appear to bear us any grudge!
I thought for hours about whether Carmelita should accept Bernard's marriage proposal . . .
Your mother is a rather miserable woman . . . isn't she?
Come down.
Not yet.
This is Friday, her riding lesson is on Tuesdays. I got it right here...
I know, Uncle, you've told me that already.
When did you get in?
Return it to me? Indeed you may not. I gave it to you as a present.
But my mother says I mustn't accept gifts from strangers.
You do that, Edward.
I've been watching you. You couldn't see me, but I could see you. It was like peeking through a slit in the curtain before the play began. You would be a very good audience. I can see that.
If you were the lady who gave me a ring, my mother says I have to give it back to you.
You're not in school? What do you do?
...she works with animals, she...
Yeah, you know, when you called I thought, there's a name from the past.
I'm only trying to...
All three -- in chronological order.
I got poked around... here and there.
I love all of them. They're strong, gentle men with families of their own. And if you asked them about what they did to me, they'd call you a fucking liar and then beat the shit out of you.
I love my brothers.
Are you serious?
Listen to me. The one thing in life that I definitely don't regret...is the choice. I made to be your mother.
Am I!
I miss you.
No, he didn't.
Are you mad at me?
Nooo. If I could just have a roll, I'd be okay.
If we could just eat first.
You goin', Mom?
Where'm I going?
Well, the bulk of it will be about the pimento loaf--
Tell me another secret about my Dad.
It's an expose on cafeteria food.
Do you know where you're going ?
The forwarding number. I haven't seen you at any support groups.
Where have you been the last few weeks?
You haven't been going to yours.
I don't...
They're watching.
Whewwww! You sure keep my mind jumping, boy!
Only this isn't a bail bond, Max.
Yeah, your fee. I had to figure that out, since there wasn't no note.
You worked for it -- if you're sure that's all you want.
I saw Ray the other day. Boy is he pissed he missed all the excitement.
How can you do that if she's already off the line?
What now?
Buon' giorno.
I can get in the back.
Oh boy. What if you're wrong?
Did your Momma really give you castor oil?
I'll say anything you want me to say. I fuckled Salvy. I fucked Tommy. I fucked your brother. I fucked everybody! What do you want to hear? I sucked your brother's fuckin' cock!
Really?
There! You said it was boring.
No, but I work there--I like it. My dad's a lobsterman.
Maybe.
DON'T, come on!!!
DON'T!!!
What do you mean quot;Uh Oh quot;???
In the tar??
Owh...
Can I smoke?
Nobody, I tell you. Jake stop it.
Take your time.
Me?
Should I call you later?
I'll just see you when you get back here.
I'm sorry. You're right.
I think he's weird, but that's me.
For work.....
Ok.
Where do you have to go?
No!
Yes...How's Billy?
Yes you do.
Sure did.
So what do we do ?
Texas... You were right about what happened to me there.
Hey. Where'd you learn to shoot like that?
Are you going to apologize or not?
Damn. I hate that! I hate bein' called a beaver, don't you?
You probably even called us beavers on your CB radio, didn't you?
I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again.
I'm only trying to help him, Mother.
Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books. Mother gave him a dose of castor oil and he cursed it, he took the Lords name in vain, then claimed he hadn't said it. He lied, Daddy.
You mustn't be a tattletale, dear. You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear.
Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens.
I used to go out with a politician.
Not for a couple of months. The last time I heard from her she was living in San Francisco.
Uh, huh...She said she had a good job, was playing a lot of tennis. She wanted to know all about Billy.
Thank you.
I don't care.
That's good... That's good.
... Yes, I am, Ben.
I'm looking for my nephew, Thomas.
Dammit, Auggie, don't ask so many questions. Just get in the car.
Rashid? Rashid! Is that what he told you his name was?
...I don't know... It's true he touches me. I love him.
How wonderful!
See, we're very modern.
Yeah, a little. I think you grew an inch or so. And you've lost weight.
You look... different.
You can all go home, now. He's not going anywhere.
Yeah, he thinks he's evolved to a higher plane of existence, or something. Maybe he has. You've seen him surf... that frenzy. It seems like anger. It's not. It's the energy of lovemaking. The sea is the woman in his life. She's his only true lover.
People are expendable to Bodhi.
We went out for about five minutes... which is four minutes longer than most of them. But you can't hold it against him, he's... different.
Um, ten-o-five. Why? Where are you?
Hood residence.
We're not going anywhere.
And?
The young man, Mr. Davis, seems to be some kind of an unofficial observer a correspondent of some sort
I don't think so. Why?
Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow!
Whenever I compliment Simone, you take the credit.
Do you? Oh do you, darling?
It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds!
You've got to tell me what happened?
They are English. They don't understand.
Yes, thank you very much.
Yes.
Who is she?
Ya know, I'm thinkin' -- with another income coming in, I would love to get a bigger place.
Ellie. Arroway.
He's an incredible prick but I never learned so much in my life.
Sounds like a Russian general.
I read your paper on ETI's. It's brilliant.
Not long ago...
"I'm an incredible woman?" What is this, a death sentence?
What I've always done. As long as I'm the only one who can build the nanobot, I'm the only one who can say when it should be tested.
I hope you're right. I'd feel a lot worse if he had read them and just didn't care.
You won't. That's why you're whispering.
Just one question. Since Dr. Argon no longer has feeling below his waist, how is it that you're still able to do your job?
You ran off with Dad when you were only 17! Nana Parker told me!
How dreary - to be - Somebody How public - like a Frog To tell one's name - the livelong June To an admiring Bog!
I wouldn't know.
I'd better order some food. That sounds like an interesting case. Wouldn't you like to take it?
Then why'd you come after me?
Room service, please -
Sounds like a good case. Girl mysteriously murdered. No one knows who did it. They haven't found any clues yet -- no gun -- no fingerprints --
Six weeks. But who's counting?
Yes, I know. You want a lock to carry in your wallet?
That's right.
That is not possible.
Did you get some sleep?
Upstairs. Why?
I'm not worried. Everything will be fine. The old team together. Nothing can stop us.
Come on.
Politics. He's the district representative. We met at the University in Pisa.
One or two. Bur there're not all that many Salvatores. I've got a son, too...he's older. And you, do you have children?
Of course I remember him. I'm sorry. You were terribly fond of him.
My husband...you know him.
All things considered, yes. Even if it wasn't what I dreamt of then...
I never said... Oh look. That's just a figure of speech. She said something funny, and I said...
Oh for Christ's...
I'm sorry. She misunderstood, that's all.
Doctor, I hate to break this to you, but my mother is a little batty.
You what?
Because you like it on your turkey sandwiches.
Thank you for taking me home.
Maybe he does love me -- only he doesn't have the nerve to tell his wife.
What the hell for?
What does this guy want?
No.
Every word.
You're going to think I'm crazy or something.
Please, Yuri.
I don't want this. Yuri, please. I really don't want this. You know I don't like to do groups.
We're not discussing your age.
They'll be looking for you.
No--I was just--maybe--
A bad one. It was the only book in there. Norman, come here, look at this.
The library.
She did...?
You hypocrite. Do you think for one moment you'd be doing what you're doing if it wasn't for who you are--what you are? Don't you get any satisfaction knowing that your children will be able to live to a ripe old age unless they do something foolish?
Happy birthday, darling...
Bill... Bill, it's your birthday.
Of course, birthday and welcome home... who'll I ask?
Many happy returns of the day...
I can't.
Oh, Nurse! He would give Thomas Kent the life of Viola De Lesseps's dreaming.
Ok, I guess.
Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason...
It'll spoil our supper.
Do you believe in that stuff? Reincarnation?
Me neither. Oh, there's an inscription on the back. The way a crow Shook down on me The dust of snow From a hemlock tree Has given my heart A change of mood And saved some part Of a day I rued.
Yeah. I'm not, like, a Robert Frost lover by any stretch. His stuff seems strictly grade school to me. But this made me cry for some reason. Maybe because it is grade school. Y'know?
I miss grade school. I don't know why I'm calling it grade school all of a sudden. When I went we called it elementary school. But I like grade school better. Sounds like something someone from the forties would call it. I'd like to be from then. Everyone wore hats. Anyway, cheers!
God, that feels so fucking good. Take yours off.
And, please, Chauncey - don't rush your decision. I know you're not a man to act on the spur of the moment.
Oh, sure you do, the financial assistance program. I think you might be just the man to take charge of such an undertaking. I'd like you to meet with the members of the Board, we'll be able to discuss the matter at greater length at that time.
... You know, Chauncey, there's something about you... You're direct, you grasp things quickly and you state them plainly. You don't play games with words to protect yourself. I feel I can speak to you frankly... You know what I was talking to you about last night?
Don't rush me, okay? You're jumping to conclusions before I've even said anything. And besides, it's not for me. It's for our daughter.
Hello?
What are you doing?
Fucking do. I had him all over me.
Don't look at me like that. Auggie. It gives me the creeps.
He's all right.
What a nice compliment.
You're not a failure, Dick.
My mother's buying me a new car for college.
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
I'm real upset about what you wrote.
You don't know where the Iraqis have moved to. And our forces haven't even engaged the Republican Guard yet, we don't know--
My script?
Jake, why don't you just try lying down and get some rest.
Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything like that, huh?
You don't know a name off-hand you like better, do you, Diz?
I'm getting out of there. Right now, Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. I'm gonna clear outa that office-- everything I own--my extra hat-- everything--
I won't take it! See? I won't be party to murder. See? Steering a poor dope up blind alleys for that grafting Taylor mob is low enough. But helping that dame cut him up in little pieces besides--nobody's gonna make me do that. No, sir.
Right now--everything I own--!
Ross. Real pleased to meet you. I'm Erin.
I guess I did.
Nope. Maiden.
Forget it, it'll never work.
You're out of your minds, you know that? Both of you. You don't even know if there's anything out there. What the hell are you thinking?
Good night.
I think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.
No. I have to go in. I live here.
Become? One is born a saint.
How is that Wally doing?
Yeah... I have to go to town.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for awhile, right?
Don't give me this passive aggressive bullshit. If you want to leave, leave. My life doesn't stop when you walk out the door, you know what I'm saying?
The Master is dressing. I am to offer you a drink. There is whiskey and there is iced tea.
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.
Expect nothing fancy.
Why?
We don't have time for hysterics.
Daniel!
Once the subject was polymerized we were unable to reassemble the original organic structure.
Yes.
What has happened to you is nothing compared to what is going to happen to Calumet City if we don't hurry.
Where he always is.
Lock the door behind you.
I felt...pain. That she'd been hurt by someone. This is great. I'm trying to intuit the emotions of a figment of my--
What?
Oh yeah! Well if ya don't mind, I'll decide on my own date!
And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
Thelma, please get a hold of yourself. You're making a spectacle.
You know, Louise, you're supposed to be my best friend. You could at least be a little bit happy for me. You could at least pretend to be slightly happy that for once in my life I have a sexual experience that isn't completely disgusting.
I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
Oh, Thelma. Oh, no.
I mean I finally understand what all the fuss is about. This is just a whole 'nother ball game!
What's wrong with you?
Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
Most of them invite me to sit in the cockpit...play with the levers and things. MAVERICK Well, get used to it.
Why does that sound silly?
Why are these all opened?
Then why did you bring them?
And here's one from nice Mr. Zeiss. He says that...
What?
You kill me, Mama.
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?
She's in her room.
When I tell him that you're unfit to live a normal life with normal people - a cataleptic!
Wouldn't I?
It's three years old, it --
Oh Louis, I just don't know about this--
No. It's a Christmas present.
Finished with these?
You re mad...
Louis, are you sure?
Not so... easily. Why aren't you... fighting...? go on... we're almost there...
-- I don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!
A little... You think it's the same for Jacques?
He can learn. He is learning.
How do you know that?
... Not yet.
Say, I just heard the merger isn't going thru. Isn't that grand?
I saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth.
You're certain?
I think you're mad! You're really mad!
And I bet you say that to all the girls --
Oh, Rob, shut up.
Ron told me that Bob Haldeman's been calling. But you won't talk to him ... if he's convicted, will you pardon him?
I hate overly ripe bananas -- they make me want to throw up.
Excellent point.
Thank you. Those were all words. I hate the planet Uranus. Terrible name for a planet.
Cooper, back the fill off I don't have enough shadow...
How's it going?
Holly, please. Don't insult me.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I don't know anything about it.
What do you believe in then?
I go backpacking a lot. Lose myself in the wilderness for a week or two.
So beautiful!
Yeah, but --
What will I tell Annie?
Don't you go to school?
That's all you got from him? That bastard helped take your life away from you.
It went real good.
All right, y'all gonna go with me?
Would y'all like that?
I'll be back in a little bit then.
What are you...? No.
The check, Bruce!
What's the matter?
I'm sure you haven't any.
Yes, wasn't it?
Put him in Doctor Spivey's office!
Oh, no. How could you ever think of such a thing?
"We're" not over-reacting.
No.
How'd the show go?
So why's he do it?
Aren't the kids asleep?
Not so good.
No, it's awful. Oh my, it's awful.
How can you do that?
What are you doing?
You think he'll like it?
Eat me, Sebastian. It's alright for you to fuck everyone, but because I'm a girl it's wrong. Well let me tell you something, I didn't ask to be a girl. Do you think I relish the fact that I have to act like Mary Sunshine twenty four seven, so I can be considered a "laaaady." Do you think I take great delight when I hear - "Kathryn is so wonderful." "Kathryn is a model child." "Kathryn is going to make an excellent wife one day." I'm the Marsha fucking Brady of the upper East Side and sometimes I want to kill myself for it. No, I don't enjoy being a part of the weaker sex and for that reason everyone around me is going to suffer. So there's your psychoanalysis Doctor Freud. Now are you in or are you out?
Fries.
I got a lawyer, Jake. We're getting a divorce. I'm getting custody of the kids.
That's not compliment, Melvin... That's just trying to sound smart so I feel stupid... A compliment is something nice about somebody else... Now or never.
And mean it...
I am so afraid you're about to say something awful...
You weren't dreaming about me.
Then I wasn't beautiful.
Yes -- oh my, God. Is that you, Simone?! I've been wanting to talk to you.
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.
I am, but ...
All right, let's say for the moment that I believe everything you are saying.
You think I'm lying?
I didn't say that, but since you did, let's say that you are. It would have been easy to set Shelly up. You could have got him killed knowing that Caesar would bring the money to the apartment.
All you would need to keep yourself clean would be someone unconnected, someone like me.
Is that what you think?
I'm just making a point. You have no idea what you're asking. How much trust two people need to do something like this.
The difference is, I can have sex with someone I just met, someone I hardly know, but to steal I need to know someone like I know myself.
No.
Or angry little mountain streams-- and cattle moving against the sun. You haven't seen any of that, have you, Diz?
You've never seen prairie grass with the wind leaning on it, have you, Diz?
You--you've been a good egg, Diz. Maybe we could clear out of this town--get to feel like people --get the habit of lifting up our eyes-- live like we just got out of a tunnel.
No! I can't think of anything more sappy!
Woman...
What is this?
Yeah? When was the last time?
Ah Stephen, that's what this is really about, isn't it? You always have to be right.
I know he's out, but how's he doing?
What's wrong, Stephen? C'mon, you only beat up the roof when something's on your mind. How's Brian doing?
You can't keep being his father...
Well, maybe I wouldn't lie...but I could tell the story the way I did just now, so that people could understand that John is even more of a hero, and that you... you're the lowest thing that ever crawled. Your name will be synonymous with cynical opportunism and blackmail. You won't get a cent.
I was wrong!!
Never drive again!
Yes!
What are you doing here?
Then tell me this isn't true! That your concern for your play and career is one thing - and that poor frightened hysterical girl another - and that your concern for her has nothing to do with either your play or your career!
I'm a human being, I've got some!
Frank only responds to commands in German. He was trained in Frankfurt. My Dad loves the idea of having a dog around, but hates the fact he lives inside.
Frank doesn't take to most people. Do you speak German?
Do you like dogs, Mr. Creasy?
You realize that you've brought a killer into the house.
I think it's nice he's American.
My children make me happy. I miss them so much. Beth. Scott and Beth. I'm going to name my daughter after you.
But I'm remembering the future.
I remember that book! Grandpa, Grandma, I want to tell you something.
There's nothing you can think of -- old letters, anything, that might give me some hint as to where I might find Jacqueline?
Mrs. Redi, there's one thing -with Jacqueline gone, how do you carry on the business? What do you do with the receipts? How do you sign checks--?
I didn't know.
But you must know someone who has seen or heard of my sister.
Then call me tomorrow.
She likes to see you off in the morning.
My shoes.
Would you rather leave?
Well excuse me.
Their parents, I'm pretty sure.
Thanks.
It's a really nice place you have. Is the rent high?
Oh, bu...uh...I can't say that.
Ni...
Yes? Oh, hello -- sure I got home all right -- you owe me forty-five cents.
Thursday? That's The Untouchables -- with Bob Stack.
Yes, sir.
I don't want to come here anymore.
That I want you to take me home.
I used to like yogurt.
Sure.
Oh, it's just marriage in general you're not enthusiastic about, huh?
You've got everything?
You'll be fine. No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side. Don't forget that.
And who's gonna run the projector until you get back? Mrs. Terwilliger?
What you want?
May I come in?
What you want'em for?
Oh.
I'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee --
-- you phony asshole --
So you haven t seen the film, then?
What did you expect?
Dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. You set me free. I reveal myself to myself and I am drenched and purged.
No more, Robert... No more needles...
I know, Robert... But, strangely enough, I don't feel too bad about now... I feel all right... I guess it's easier... knowing Chauncey is here... to take care of things...
Pepsi? Tequila?
Wouldn't dream of it, sir.
Nothing.
-- whatever, and the Israelis and the Palestinians don't. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye are not engaged in a bitter territorial dispute, and the Israelis and the Palestinians are. Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye --
No, I haven't seen him in a few weeks.
Thanks for everything, Max. Wow...
No, no way, I couldn't take that...
How often you go?
What is?
Well... Get going. You're still bleeding.
Hey, Lenny. We made it.
Are we under arrest?
Is that right? I'd like a word with him.
Don't be ridiculous. I'm a reporter.
May I ask if you are Jewish, Mr Lombard?
Lombard, this is not a Jewish name, is it?
Sure wish I had longer to get used to the idea. You think if you got no uterus, and no breasts, you're still technically a woman?
I know better than you what people will say when they have to. When they brought me in for questioning I informed on my friends the very first day.
I think you've just escaped for the moment. Just as I did. As Eduard did. As they let us do. But only for the moment.
Why should I believe a man who never believed me? They're absolutely right, you know -- guilt should never be doubted. It's easier that way.
Funny, I don't get that feeling. Maybe it's because you found out I'm Bill Parrish's daughter.
No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
Minute flecks were spattered across the seat and steering wheel. The instrument panel was buckled inwards, cracking the clock and the speedometer dials. The cabin was deformed, and there was dust and glass and plastic flakes everywhere inside. The carpeting was damp and stank of blood and other body and machine fluids.
I wish I had. They bury the dead so quickly - they should leave them lying around for months.
Hi.
The day he died, Eduard was called up to the Castle. Did you know that?
I thought I could give you a lift back.
Hi.
You're right, Bud. It was just that simple. Aren't you clever? You should get your own show... Ask Dr. Bud, advice to the lovelorn from three hundred fathoms.
Yes. Well, I'm coming over to your house to get some things.
Tuna, this is crap.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Could he speak English? Emilio couldn't speak English.
On television, you seemed so sure of yourself. If you're really that confident, you'd be willing to let someone prove you wrong?
An exorcism was just held for Birdson. It failed. Disastrously. Which means there's still a demonic spirit present in his body. I was wondering, perhaps you'd like to go meet Henry. He's pretty amazing.
Last week the Catholic Church certified him as genuinely possessed. You realize how rarely they make that ruling?
Do you remember Henry Birdson? The math professor who won the Salwen Medal, then went home and killed his family?
How does one get 125 million dollars in debt?
Honey?
I love that belt. What are you, about a fifty Big and Tall?
I didn't get a thing. Just the music lessons. That's all there was to it.
No.
That light.
I think...it...works.
He's going to kill himself. Go skate out on the bike path! It's that way!
So what happens now?
If it'll make you happy.
I have no idea.
Uh-huh. Well, I'm a police officer from up Brainerd investigating some malfeasance and I was just wondering if you've had any new vehicles stolen off the lot in the past couple of weeks - specifically a tan Cutlass Ciera?
It's so beautiful!
Well, you can help me. My name's Marge Gunderson -
Yes, what kind of arrangement? I'd be very interested to know what kind of an arrangement we have.
...You're the owner here, Mr. Lundegaard?
What?
Is this the protective male talk?
Would you? Because if you couldn't, I would be very lonely... I would have left the only world I know and have known since I was seventeen. But none of this will happen. So it doesn't matter. Because we are on the Guajira Peninsula. And all you see around you...look around... is Archangel de Jesus Montoya- Londono. He is my man. And you are a smuggler moving a load...
And if I were in the Comoros, in the Indian Ocean, where would you be...?
Who?
Weird they didn't chase us.
Lenny, have you lost it completely?
You better keep a low profile for a while.
Yeah, you is. I know when people is in trouble, and you is.
Is that true?
Who? Tell me!
But if all I can give 'em is Ordell's name -- I don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it -- That don't give me much to bargain with.
Yeah, if I cooperate.
I was expecting you. Come in.
I think maybe I have more options than I thought.
He needed some clothes.
With what?
Mm-hm.
He wanted a watch, too.
Hi. Hi, hi.
By making me ill, he is punishing me! I just don't know what for.
Be yourself and I don't think there is a wrong thing. Let Jamie take the lead. She'll let you know what she needs.
I should have told you sooner --
He feels he has to defend himself if necessary.
Hi.
The Buddhists have been saying that for a millennium.
I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
Hattie is a different person now.
You must have done something to her.
Good afternoon to you.
Yah. Say, Lou, ya hear the one about the guy who couldn't afford personalized plates, so he went and changed his name to J2L 4685?
Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
Oh my god. You bought it.
Absolutely.
Looks like he missed ya.
Don't say that; reading's my salvation.
So. Are you an hallucination? Or are little gear trains and circuit boards under your skin?
I used... I used to dream you were alive... and then I'd wake up and lose you all over again.
Dad... But tell me, how did... I mean how can...?
You're not real. None of this is.
Would we see the flash?
The party?
Shit! Fuck! What s fucking wrong with people! I m going to bed. And sweet dreams to you to!
I hate to turn on this light, you Daddy's awake downstairs, but I have to take the chance. Buddy, please don't tell on me.
You are always trying to keep it real. I'm in love with how you feel. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. So why can't you forgive me? I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
Here is the church and here is the steeple. We sure are cute for two ugly people. I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.
I worked for Mr. Marsh for six years. He was a good man -- until she came along.
No, I wanna say hi.
Well, offer her a seat! You want me to do it?
Mmm... I love it when you talk like that.
Mother's set her heart on a big church wedding.
So, why did you bring this along?
This bar's going to be packed with girls for you to pick from.
Jesus, Seymour.
Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says?
I usually have a break after the dinner service, if you want to stop by.
yeah, good, ok.
If you're not here for a 422 --
We were just gettin' warmed up. We were just getting started.
Yes. I will. It was nice to meet you Officer Jim.
I'm sorry.
I consider it less my failure than his.
Hi, Jonah. Sam. And who is this?
Well... have a good flight.
Ok, bye.
He's learning his letters.
Learnin' to read has nothing to do with the right or the wrong side of the street.
They're stragglin'.
Is that what you call it?
There.
Well, you had better!!
Look! I'm limping! How attractive is that?! What if this is for life?!
Yeah. I'm surprised. It's really old... Travels well though. You know, the world looks a lot better from up here.
Don't you get along with your parents?
Thank God he did.
Well I remember he had one... but he, like, put it away after the first day. Why would that freak me out?
'Cause you went out the back door and nailed her girlfriend? Who would take offense to that?
You mean until you showed up?
Really?
In case you've never heard of how I lost all my money - and it was plenty, believe me -
They haven't been tough on me. I just lost my money. But when I compare these last ten years with the twenty I spent with him -
Don't you think I do? You say you're going down to Xanadu?
I know. If you're smart, you'll talk to Raymond. That's the butler. You can learn a lot from him. He knows where the bodies are buried.
Oh, Rocky!
You didn't!
Wanna play?
I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so...
All my life I have never reached a man. I knew that I would reach my husband, but I took my time and he was dead. Ronny.
How the hell should I know how much?
Yes, Addison.
The money?
Time for a change. Keep your margins straight.
Yeah?
Oh. Oh, yeah. No. This is a different one.
Called? When?
I must have fallen asleep. I was asleep when you got home, wasn't I?
That's another thing I can't do.
Terry...?
Mmmm! Tasty. You're a master chef Ben. Just like your dad.
Tommy, what happened?
Let me by.
quot;Goodnight moon, goodnight hush, goodnight mush, goodnight goodnight goodnight Gracie -- Goodnight Ben!
Thank you.
What?
A hanger.
Either one will be fine.
Cold is good-- Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?!
Well, we don't let that happen, now do we?
He's already there.
Ordell called and wants to meet me and I'm scared.
I've chickened out. I'm afraid of him. He'll like that.
This is my daddy's house --
Don't deny me, Duff.
You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you.
I'm in the bath, mom.
Don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because I know.
I wasn't Lena. I didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.
Child, please. Ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything I had to say.
It seems almost inconceivable that I haven't seen her backstage, but with so many people loitering around... well, well. So Eve is not working for Max after all- - Max you sly puss.
Eve? Eve, my understudy? But I had no idea...
Okay, I want you to tell me what these fellas looked like.
Eve? How enchanting... Wherever did you get the idea of having Eve read with Miss Caswell?
How are you making out in Mr. Fabian's office? I don't want you working the child too hard, Max - just because you promised. As you see, I kept my promise, too...
I can't read. Nobody taught me.
My parents were divorced.
That all depends on you. ...Sure you don't want a drink?
No, thank you.
What are you talking about, Gilbert? You weren't there!
I've never been in an apartment above a store. You always pass them on the street but you never think anyone really lives in them.
Would you find me...?
Of course not --
Goodness, Mr. Webster, I've done nothing but talk about that all through dinner.
Why -- yes -- it's hard to put it into words, Mr. Webster. There's this matter of little Daniel's schooling and the new house -- and well -- there's something else that's wrong -- it gets worse, year after year -- it's like a shadow growing -- I can't really talk about it, even to Ma -- she puts it all on Jabez and I won't stand for that.
Yes.
Hi, Rob and Carrie.
Yeah. Come to bed. I'm cold.
Yes.
My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person.
I was having an affair with Eduard. He didn't tell you?
What if I plead guilty?
I'm tellin' you, I don't know nothin' about that fuckin' shit.
You tell those guys they'll have to do one helluva lot better than that before I'll even say 'hi' to them.
Who's side are you on?
Yeah.
Oh.
Yeah, thanks. Thanks a lot. Well...
Huh? Oh... yeah.
...got a strange call from the SEC. They asked to see my records... Bud, this is a heavy...
Miriam called, looking for you. She said you might come, so I...
Those days are over, Gordon. They were over a long time ago.
No.
How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
Where am I?
You ever think about it? You ever worry?
Oh God, Tommi...
But Ed, we're not even married. And you don't have a job.
Get along with you.
I don't know. It's so much money...
No way... Would you?
You know what I mean. Would you... let yourself get pregnant?
No more backward, if you ask me, than the way these hotshot assholes fuck us, then ditch us. Don't you ever feel used, Paula? Don't you ever feel like if this is all you get for your trouble then the sonofabitch ought to be paying for it...?
It's so beautiful. It's just what I would have picked out if I'd had every ring in the world to choose from. You see what I mean. There are people who would like a relationship to be full of surprises, but I am not one of them. Surprises are highly overrated.
How could anybody behave like that?
Are you the funniest person I know, or what?
I can't think how you gave it all up, Soph.
Oh. Do you have any pictures?
Pictures. They're always in my tote. I left my tote in the damn trailer. But! He's Mac all over again. Imagine Mac shrunk to two-and-a-half feet. The fact is they probably didn't even need me for this birth.
I tried to tell you right away but you started reminiscing. I'm getting married, Walter, and also getting as far away from the newspaper business as I can get! I'm through.
You can't sell me that, Walter.
I'm not working for any other paper!
Look at this!
He's grubbing for money, father.
No, it's not ok! We're not about to be robbed blind by some two-bit hustler on the make!
George --
What are you saying -- we can't stop what's out there?
I'm sorry.
I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid?
I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no?
Nothing. Be right out.
Singing?
Now what the hell are we supposed to do ?
How's your foot ?
Come back some other time, will you?
He's your son.
I didn't see you this morning.
I'm in a hurry too. I just thought I could say hi to you.
That was my father-in-law, who has a wrong idea in his head. Listen, Johnny, there's a question I want to ask you. And I want you to tell me the truth if you can. Why do men chase women?
You're kidding?
That's incredible.
You're not gonna win.
Make it my first born.
You wish. You'll do shit work, scan, crack copyrights, whatever I want.
If I win, you become my slave.
Are you challenging me?
Jerome--?
Let's go all the way.
Buy me a ticket to The Great Went.
She's an editor.
Sh! Then you must keep it true. Goodnight, darling.
But it's already come true.
Mm. But ya think he's all right? saw him last night and he's -
Well, it was nothin' specific he said, it just seemd like it all hit him really hard, his wife dyin' -
Are they nice?
No dear. I don't know them, but I've heard about them.
Do you know the people?
The Farren house
You mustn't tell anybody, or it won't come true.
I got my wish anyway.
Well the mother or daughter -- whichever one gave it to you. You ask Edward to go with you.
I really don't know, but I do know that you must return the ring. You get Edward to take you up there and bring it back to the old lady.
No, this is about getting something right and claryfying one of your answers to an earlier question --
Not like books or literature or anything. Just a magazine... Just in case she hasn't told you -- which I'm sure she hasn't -- I don't want to be a part of this, OK?
The boy done went into my walnuts! I skin my fingers to the bone to pick two pounds that's worth almost nothing at the commissary and he done took almost half of what I pick!
He wanted to see me again.
You tell me.
I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee, Nathan Lee.
No, son. We havta wait 'til the holiday comes -- anyway, they won't let womenfolk see their men no time.
Of course. She is my sister. I tell her almost everything.
Why not?
Doesn't work. He has to know the people, he has to be able to interact with them.
I felt like it, so what? Goddam, you and Ann make such a big deal out of it.
You think they're going to bust us?
Doing what?
What were you doing there?
Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
Then let's spend some money.
Aw, c'mon, live dangerously. Take the leap and assume someone is talking to you in an otherwise empty car.
Phreak?
I'm sure we could find a country and western station.
Nope.
And Annette's it for you?
Really?
Who was your girl before Annette?
Yeah, she's the girl who drove the bus in "Speed." She's cute.
Why?
Why?
Hello?
I don't like coconuts.
He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there. It would kind of save us a honeymoon.
I just don't.
And the snakes? You want to know about the snakes? You saw one outside earlier, didn't you? When you thought I had deserted you -- you were terrified.
Yeah. Could look bad for you and Kaminski too, I guess.
Whattaya mean?
But I'm not. The newspapers're --
Oh yeah! I saw you in the newsreel!
You know, my Dad's done some work for Kaminski...
Darryl.
Go fuck yourself.
Thank God we got you away from her, huh?
Hey, do you want to see this one? Daddy gave me all this jewelry because he loves me so much. Put your arm in there.
No, I read it on the message.
You know, all you know is what's good for you.
I don't... I don't... Geez, I don't know, I've... I wa- This... yeah, I got this VW out there... What a jerk, yeah. Would you like a lift?
You bet I wouldn't.
You mean, he might be hiding there?
Nick - I won't have you going down there.
I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
Yeah, I guess.
How about you?
It's silly of me to argue about it. I don't know the people involved.
Well, maybe that's what they teach you in New York University. In real life, it don't work out that way. You wait till you are a mother.
I don't think a mother should depend so much upon her children for her rewards in life.
Where do you think a mother-in-law should go?
Do you want more rice?
You don't think my sister Catherine should live in her daughter-in-law's house?
You mustn't feel too harshly against her daughter-in-law. She also wants to have a house to clean and a family to cook for.
Hobby! What can she do? She cooks and she cleans. You gotta have a house to clean. You gotta have children to cook for. These are the terrible years for a woman, the terrible years.
Couldn't she find some sort of hobby to fill out her time?
C'mon. How old are you, sixteen? C'mon.
I got fifty dollars to spend in your store, Jesus of Nazareth. Can you help me or not?
Thank you.
We did...?
No, he left last week.
What do you mean, like physically?
I guess, but not because of the way he looked or anything. He's just so different, somebody new to have a conversation with. I'm just tired of talking to other couples about whether or not they're going to buy the station wagon, you know? It's just boring. I don't know, he was just different. And he's really on about truth a lot, being honest, and I like that, I felt comfortable around him. After he left I had a dream that he signed a lease to rent our guest room.
I don't know. He went to school here, then he was in New York for awhile, then Philadelphia, and then just kind of travelling around.
Must be nice. So, what's he like, is he like John?
The bartender at Darrow's. He was there Friday night.
I didn't think anyone would get it.
Where were you, Jake? Where've you been? Why haven't you called?
Good Lord!
I guess when I nearly died giving birth to you--that shows how much I don't care!
I told you I was positive. The speedometer was large and easy to see from where I was.
Positive.
No.
Yes.
I was scared. And there wasn't time.
The funny thing is, I'm not Randall either. I'm Logue.
Which is?
Right.
As in the Textile Logues. Trying to shrug off the dress. I travel under my mother's name, too.
You owe me a quarter.
The same size?
Of course!
It's stupid... It's so fucking stupid!
I don't see why we gotta lie 'bout it when you and I know this ain't gonna work.
This ain't gonna work.
Say what, Walt Spoon!
I just don't believe that!
Such as?
John's bad.
How do you mean?
She lived in Tarzana.
His parents? Is that what he told you? His parents?
Sure.
What?
Don't say that! I don't want to hear you say that!
You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy. Bothered the hell out of you. But as soon as you gave him the clarinet...
No, they're not. I'd say your investment was paying dividends.
You tried to once. It was pretty pitiful.
I don't want to know...
Mickey! Oh God, Mickey!
Wha-- What kind of things do you build?
I sure hope you don't. I gotta get outta here, good night.
We saw, um, Pavarotti, eh, uh, in Ernani at the Met, and I cried...
Yep.
It's Saturday.
I'm sorry.
I like it better when I'm on top.
Is it me?
Where are you going?
Get on this, right now...
...this's good...
He'll come down. Leave him alone.
Leave him alone.
Yes, that's what's important to me...
What have you got there?
No inner feeling.
It's getting late...
It's late. We should go back.
Dark and large. With vines -- no, not vines. Not alive.
You know, I've always considered myself a very clever girl. Smart. Good head on my shoulders, that sort of thing, never the wrong word at the wrong time... but then, I'd never met Addison deWitt. I remember once I had a tooth pulled. They gave me some anaesthetic - I don't remember the name - and it affected me in a strange way. I heard myself saying things I wasn't even thinking... as if my mind were someplace outside of my body, and couldn't control what I did or said-
Whom?
Just them?
What do we do?
I have to get my teeth cleaned this week.
That's a very pretty shawl you are wearing, Alex. Silk suits you well. But you are not eating enough. One must not let vanity overrule one's appetite.
If I were triplets , I couldn't--. Look, Senator--let me give you a rough idea. A member has a Bill in mind--like you--a camp. Right?
My dear Senator, have you the faintest idea of what it takes to get a Bill passed?
Pardon me. Senator Paine decided this with you?
One moment, Senator. Do I understand you're going to present a Bill ?
We're going right ahead with-- what ?
Smells like fish.
Smells like tuna number two to me.
Monica and Ryan.
You mean travel by ourselves?
I shouldn't stick my nose in other people's business. It's just that I like Vada, very much.
Let's go overseas . . .
I'm sure she will.
No, you're not, Gina-it's everybody else who is bonkers!
I think I'm going crazy.
Stay still or they'll be blurry . . .
Surprised?
Are you married?
I didn't know you had one.
Just for the day?
Do you remember a Miss Simms?
Just a couple more . . .
How do you know that?
Hardy, what are you doing --
Hardy, for Chrissakes --
You know the fifteenth is the deadline for the Iraqis to get out of Kuwait.
Uh, Udall?
Everything. You're...the Earth Mother incarnate...
What do you need at the store?
So?
Yeah, I know Peggy Sue gets married. Case closed. Period. Mom, if you could live your life over again, would you do the same thing? Get married and settle down after high school?
Call me Laurie, will ya?
What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real!
Could we hear God?
Okay, okay... there.
Could we hear to China?
Could we hear to the moon?
Mm.
I guess I did.
What's wrong?
John Bonham?
First we talk. How did Earl Williams get that gun?
A lot of money. Four hundred and fifty dollars --
Four hundred and fifty dollars. Is it a deal?
You drive like a maniac!
Why? Who said?
Yes - but you live here too - If it were your house?
After that, I plan to read some music and rest for awhile.
I don't know why I asked you to come.
I mean, you known this city. You've been here for so long.
If you can, please call me. Please. I have to go now... goodnight.
Perfect example.
I'm sorry, I only...
I don't sleep very well.
Oh... why Mr. Merrick she's beautiful.
I've always thought that myself.
And here are my mother and father.
Right. Yeah, but Fifth is so jammed, isn't it?
Sweetie! Oh, but we can't. It's business hours. I need to keep the membranous tunnel open for paying customers.
I have to see you.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone else can be.
You bastard.
Suck my dick!
What the hell, darling. Close early today, live dangerously.
Let's get it over with.
Where are they?
Go.
With our hands.
I don't know how fresh it's gonna be --
Scared. No, not scared. Wary. Like I was something to be... her guard went up. I was a threat. Now I know why. She was afraid she'd be seen. That I would see her for the self-obsessed neurotic that she was. I think she thought she had a few more years of being on a pedestal. But that's the cycle, right? I knew a little more than she did, she knew a little more than her mother, and on and on. I guess that's part of the reason why --
No. I was going to let you do that.
I did say he could go.
Even the fall from the plane?
People were suffering in Afganistan, and we didn't do anything.
I remember when I was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. All you'd let me and Lena do was set the table. And I guess you and Dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. And you didn't say anything. You just threw the whole meal into some tupper-ware and tossed it in the fridge.
You're mad, aren't you?
Yes, thank you, Doctor.
That's right, that's right. You only gave me books with the word "death" in the titles.
What's so great about New York? I mean, it's a dying city. You read "Death in Venice."
No. We're friends. I wanna remain friends.
Alvy, you're incapable of enjoying life, you know that? I mean, your life is New York City. You're just this person. You're like this island unto yourself.
No, it doesn't...Okay, look, I see what you're doing here, and that's, I'm sorry, but that's not it. My marriage is fine. I've had some kind of "empty-nest" episode where I saw some things that weren't there. Let's deal with that. I'm willing to deal with that. I just don't want to go conjuring problems where none exist.
Yeah. I put a rag on the strings, to lessen noise.
Fine...
I'm sick with practicing, that's it...
...Composer.
I'm used to it. Not everyone likes music.
Yeah, but he's not exactly my father...
What?
Ganz is going to be hard to track. Just a pure schizo ... wires all crossed... totally without any pattern... kill anybody... The Indian... himself... anybody...
Jack, it's all over the papers. He's an obvious type. But this Indian...
How would you know?
That's no bull.
Just, you know, shopping with my girlfriends.
I don't know. It's a mystery
Nor you for me.
In all due respect, he sounds kind of pathetic to me. The kind of guy that runs home to his momma or some girlfriend. Have you two ace detectives checked that out?
No, I'm fine.
Can't survive on our bodies alone, Nick. Hurry up!
Then he shoulda signed his name.
Provisions! We are not leaving that motel room again till after New Year's: we need ten days worth of provisions! What's good?!
Oh, come on, look who's talking. You've been seeing a psychiatrist for fifteen years. You should smoke some o' this. You'd be off the couch in no time.
What are you doing?
Yeah, well you wrote me you were six- foot-four, baby. So don't talk to me about little white lies.
Uh-uh-why?
Do you know it like that? By heart.
-- do you wanna cup?
But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right?
Where'd you get this?
How come there's no punctuation?
Yeah, well maybe it's time for a war!
Who's Strickland?
So you're saying we just pretend is didn't happen? It happened! The LAPD executed one of the most important black men in America! Who the fuck are you to bury this?!
Oh, about six weeks now... Lester -- well, he's very sweet.
Jill, you're a real sweetie pie. You really are. You're sure you don't mind?
-- What for? Honey, I'll see you later.
I do apologize for this afternoon. I behaved like a silly girl. Where shall we go?
Should we stay here? It's a charming room. I love these candlesticks. Were they here earlier? I didn't notice them I suppose I was too nervous.
So who -- what -- are you?
It's hard to find time to sleep, Royce. Much less keep up with my phone life.
But are there... I mean, how many...
The woman I saw you with...
It's really terrible.
I was happy to pay. I inherited the money.
I don't know, it was just kind of the boring suburban thing. Private school, Harvard, and now Med. School. I actually figured out that at the end of it, my brain will be worth a quarter of a million dollars. I shouldn't have told you that...
Without calling me?
They're extremely aggressive birds. Plus, their habits are rather filthy.
And it ruins everything else.
Let me ask you two something. Don't be embarrassed by the answer. It is possible... Just possible now, you might have been chasing each other around? You said you went in opposite directions.
Tell me something, Dorie. A man as big as you -- and smart too, you knew where to come when your ship couldn't help -- do you still have to fight with your fists to get respect?
I'm Evelyn. And I'm just a nurse. But I'm not playing golf, and that cut needs sewing, or else it's gonna make a big lumpy scar. Whatta ya say?
How often you fight like this?
What do you get for winning?
That's not a question, is it?
But all this did I know before. What says he of our marriage? what of that?
Mm... I wouldn't worry about it.
It's unbelievable!
Now I guess you and your Aunt have an understanding. So here's the key and you need anything, just give a holler. Everybody in this building's pretty much okay with me or they wouldn't be here. If you want, later I'll introduce you around. No hard feelings if you don't, and don't forget the rooftop garden. It's just up the stairs we passed. It's open to all the tenants. You can see the Hollywood sign from there.
Wow!
You got it! See you later honey.
I'm Ruth's niece. My name's Betty. I'm sure she told you I was coming.
I thought you were here because you want to go.
The only way he'll go with Ricky is if you're in too.
You shouldn't. He likes you.
I sat in there with her, I thought, what do I do now? Run and I've got Bobo and the law after me. Stay, and how do I explain?
It is, isn't it? And maybe it's a break for me after all. I've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now I'm out. I can make a clean start, and --
I need this, Roy. I can't run without money, and if I can't run I'm dead.
Then get a goddamn snow blower!
Hush... not a word about the cake, hear?
We're only one payment behind. I argued with her. It isn't right.
I listen to it. Every night. When you're out to the beer parlor.
Do you consider that a compliment?
You say that just to flatter me.
That's a nice outfit on her. I'm gonna go over and look at this Michi Moon display.
Are you sweating?
Jesus Christ, get a grip, Louis.
The world is full of guys. Be a man. Don't be a guy.
Lloyd, you have to understand her family is being ripped apart. Like you and she were ripped apart. Like Joe and I were ripped apart.
No, you're not a guy.
Patrick?
THAT'S NOT MINE.
I don't know. Hello, Mom. Hello, Dad. Something like that.
Your first boyfriend. What do you think? Any sparks left?
They're true! Everything I said! Witholding that veto was treason!
Oil belonging to the people of the United States was leased out for a song to a gang of high-pressure crooks - Nobody can blame me because -
Because the crackpot who did it had a copy of the "Enquirer" in his pocket?
I said treason was a capital offense punishable by death -
He's a liar! He has no such thing! It's my own fault. I should have had it patented first. He's a crook, damnit.
What?
Sheerotards. Catchy name, isn't it? Like leotards.
Oh no!
I don't know.
In a saloon?
I'll be right down. It's right tight.
Thank you.
Is it terribly erotic?
Is it awfully violent?
Your publisher says I'm not to leave without a new manuscript.
It's only a little way, Mr. August.
"Rumor: Pat Boone is seriously considering giving up his career so he can return to school full-time and complete his education. Fact: Pat has told intimates that so long as things are going well for his career, it's the education that will have to take the back seat."
I'd like to get out of here.
Which room is it?
Yes.
No.
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and Rita Hayworth are in love... Fact: True, but not with each other."
Well, how'd you get here?
Well, don't you somewhere? Stuff? Belongings?
Do you have a motel or something? Money?
Great. That was our last option. What am I going to do with you?
Haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.
Cause it's my office party. If you had an office, I'd go to your party.
I wasn't lookin' through the keyhole if that's what you're thinking. I'd come to house sometimes to pick up papers or speak to Andrew. I'd find their little toys all over the place.
It's over, Dick.
I felt you...looking through me...
Good. You sat in front...I saw you there...
No. I'm not going to listen to any more speeches ever again.
Yep.
Haven't you heard about the miracle of masturbation?
Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
Oh? Where you going?
Where's West? New Jersey?
I always liked the West, west of Il- linois anyway. But you gotta give me time to pack.
Do what? I haven't done a thing.
Out with Belinda?
You saw him?
I can't know things if you don't tell me.
Sugar, you know how I feel about you, don't you? I'm just tryin' to get you to take an interest in my kind a things, an' what I'm tryin' to do with myself... You know, there id'n anything in the world I wouldn't do for you, baby. I started livin' the day I found you, you know that?
Now quit, Bobby. You said you're goin' a help me pick a song.
Well, lemme play the other side then.
How 'bout if I just cut off your damn water?
Well, lemme sing the one I picked an' see what you think... "When there's a fire in your heart Break the glass Sound the alarm..."
It's the sauna, I keep the sauna on and it makes the whole bathroom hot.
Really?
You think I'm rich and you hate me.
You just seem to know all these things about me and I don't know anything about you, you know. What kind of music do you like?
Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed.
I'd like to.
Uh, question, ma'am.
Well I don't know --
I think they're from 'you know'. Some place that has similar conditions... cold, intense pressure. No light.
Tell me why...you've got to tell me...
Why yours alone? Tell me how it was done!!!!
DID YOU DO IT TO ME????
But it's easy. It's just a breath with sound. Say it. What kind of trouble?
I had a baby.
Of what?
Of telling you.
Did you know what was going to come out?
Yes.
How did you have a baby?
It came out of me.
Did you want it to come out?
No.
OK.
I killed him... and cut him and ate all of him... I left nothing for you!
I'll have to come see you sometime.
You're a comedian?
Let me get a pen out of my car. Do you have something to write on?
I'll be around.
Me too.
Have more coffee. It'll wake you up.
I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
I'm going to take it.
Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
Save that for the laying of cornerstones, Hubert! Oh, that morning you looked in the mirror and saw a statesman!
Are you all right?
That's our man. He's made to order.
Drop that attitude. Here's some- thing really worth while.
I will not leave without the twins.
It's my bird book.
Please, please try one more time.
Come on, Montgomery...
Montgomery, why do they call you "Flea"?
Do that.
I'm not pretty.
This is Lena.
Ok. Well call me when you get back, I mean, I'll call you when I get back. I'll be back for three weeks and then I go away for a month after that. So maybe in that time....
I just wanted you to know, wherever you're going or whatever you're doing right now I want you to know that I wanted to kiss you just then.
Because if there's an attack made on Court it could be traced back to me. I can't allow that to happen. Everybody loves me and I intend to keep it that way.
Yes.
I called Mommy.
See, I knew you'd be mad.
I... because I want to go home. She said she'd come and get me.
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer. When I get through with her, she'll be the premier Blow Job Queen of the Tri-State area and poor little Court's heart will be shattered.
I don't understand.
Yes.
Good things happen, too, Creasy. Like meeting me.
Come on.
What?
Well, why don't I just say black so you can say white! Don't be surprised to find your brother hasn't changed an iota. He hardly ever talks and when he does it's in that tone! You should have heard him at lunch -- not two words until the bill came and then he says, "Worth every penny."
I'm sure you haven't done anything. Have some iced tea. How are the kids?
I am so sick and tired of apologizing and not knowing what I've done!
He's not coming.
Yeah, Mary-Kay, I think I do. Thanks a bunch for the advice.
Mom, take it easy.
Jump in the water!!
No. I can't. My mom won't let me have boyfriends.
Don't you think his girl friend's beautiful?
When are you leaving?
Huh!
How much do you want on it?
Oh, good. Okay.
Well, I mean it more now.
I said you should stop worrying because I've made up my mind!
Maybe the reason people are having trouble finding meaning isn't because science has obscured it... maybe it's just revealed it isn't there.
I hated you that day - you and your flip talk - with that little girl lying dead.
Yeah.
Si.
How can I do anything if I'm being watched every second?
It's always beautiful at this time. Peaceful...
Mi Jesus mi jesus
Green? Not Owen Green. Owen Green embezzled money from your grandfather
What choice?
You made a choice once. Do you think you would make that same choice again?
If those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?
How much money?
Caesar is going to get the money and bring --
Caesar will bring it to the apartment to count and go through Shelly's books to figure out how he did it.
Shelly said it was over two million dollars.
These people are serious, Violet. If you want to know how serious, ask Shelly. They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules. You fuck them, you've got to do it right.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Do you have any idea what you are saying? You are asking me to help you fuck the mob.
I'm thinking of going back to school.
How'd you know?
I'm that predictable? No, you don't have to answer that. It's just that with the kids almost grown --
Mi Jesus esta muerto!
There's no disturbance.
For Pete's sake, Calvin! We've got guests!
Well, put it down and come in!
I mean, what is there to be happy about really? I mean, going to the gym, climbing the StairMaster, eating the yogurt, checking the voice mail. Smoking the low-tar cigarettes, shaving the bikini line. Sometimes I just want something different, you know?
No, only when she felt like it. She brought me up here last winter and the next day she died.
We haven't seen you since... I'm terribly sorry.
You know, you're a good kid.
But in what ways?
What else did she tell you?
Hurry, Lynette. It's almost midnight.
I got my foot on the floor.
I'm going with you.
Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you.
French?
You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie.
I want the number, idiot. Anyway, I'm at Paul Norman's and I'll try you later and if I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow night I'm going to sic my hairdresser on you.
Did you know that guy who disappeared? Didn't he work at Pierce Pierce, too? Was he a friend of yours?
Do you have any coke? Or Halcyon? I'd take a Halcyon.
Patrick, you re a lunatic.
Let's not get lewd. I'm in no mood to have a lewd conversation.
Stay away from me.
I'm not.
I already made you two tapes.
I'm dealing with it, Doc. Big time. Maybe I'll make you a tape tomorrow. Goodnight.
You forgot the Hula!
You'll be lovely, but no thanks. Jacques, would you do a native dance for me?
You get her? Okay. Well, I need a lot. I need more than usual.
Well, I would, you know, Sam. It's just that... well, I need more than that. I need twenty-five thousand.
I think I'm going to give it all up.
I don't want it.
Why do people have to love people, anyway?
What do you call it when somebody keeps getting smashed up in automobile accidents?
But I think she wanted to be happy, that's why she wrote. I mean, she was still writing about love, right?
Good night, Daddy.
Sorry. Forgetful.
Yes?
What can I do for you Mr....Watson?
You were saying? Your daughter....?
I was getting out of the car when I saw him in the Mercedes.
I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.
Hey, I like this.
If you want to look at it that way...
Wake up! Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
Sit down!
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Brian.
Look, I'm horny. Keep it in mind. Love me a little?
Weird. Got some kind of snowball effect goin' here or somethin'.
Hey.
Well, we're not in the middle of nowhere, but we can see it from here.
Would you believe me if I told you this whole thing is an accident?
So did I, till I hit 19 and found I had all the royal habits and no throne. Mom got by but I had to go to work just like you. Only the skills I had were shopping and making friends. So...that's why I do what I do, what makes you tick, Buddy?
I was stoned. That's why they stopped me. When I'm not stoned, I got no place else to go. They just protect me from myself.
I understand, mister. It means something, really.
That's not hard to do.
Sure. All right. We'll have breakfast. I get up about one o'clock. Tomorrow.
Well, you want to or not?
I'm getting tired of you riding me, Jaeger.
Sorsha, Queen Bavmorda's daughter.
You don't have the stomach for it.
I just give you your life. What you do with it is up to you.
Did you hear the child out?
No I haven't. Do you know why Pierce is humoring you?
-- is that what this is all about?
Of course I am. What kind of question is that?
Yeah.
Should have at least gotten the map off of him. Blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.
Surprise.
What, and miss all the fun? C'mon, not a chance. So, what's the verdict?
-- is that right?
I was friendly with Sue Lefferts, but we weren't really friends. You know what I mean?
Better make that a certified check, Walter.
According to the budget, we laid out that's more than our food bill for a whole year. Listen, Bruce, I don't want Walter Burns to use me, but I'm perfectly willing to use him. How long will it take to get him examined?
And what's the matter with a thousand dollars?
Oh, nothing! Of course, you might cancel the check. Yes! Wait a minute! What would be his first payment on that policy?
You keep out of this. Bruce, suppose you examine Mr. Burns in his office. I'll get my bag and go over to the Press Room in the Criminal Courts Building. You phone me as soon as Mr. Burns has given you his check. Then I'll go get the interview and you phone Mother that we're taking the six o'clock train. And no tricks, Walter!
Mr. Booker, if I could just ex --
You make me sick. Just be straight for once in your life.
-- who happens to know they poisoned people and lied about it.
And this shit is bad news, Mr. Masry. Not only does it attack every organ of the body, it fucks with your DNA, too. That means these people's genes, and the genes of their kids, and the genes of their grandkids --
We can get these people. With a little effort, I really think we can nail their asses to the wall.
Okay, fine. I don't know shit about shit. But I know the difference --
No, that's not what I said. I'm not a dictator. If you feel you should come, then come. Just do whatever you think is right.
Well thanks!
Of course not.
You were impressed with something. It's pretty odd when a man sports a hard-on that large on national television.
I'm here, ain't I?
I WILL PROTECT YOU.
What?
Yes, the first one's fine. Heathrow direct.
Lester, you're a miserable man. You're not helping anybody. You're just twisting arms to raise money for a lot of silly son of a bitches that are out for themselves -- this is just business, don't kid yourself. And you know the worst thing about it, even if it does somebody some good somewhere which I can't possibly imagine, you'll never know the difference. You're just sweating and kidding yourself - and you're kidding yourself if you think your new business partner is going to keep his hands off that girl -- or that she'll keep her hands off him.
I didn't run into you and I bet they're not your Sunday clothes. You've probably got a lot of clothes.
I was only joking! This evening I was on my way to the Western Manhattan Warehouses - in search of my youth.
No. That is, I bet it turns out I've heard your name a million times, only you know how it is -
You really don't know who I am?
You've been wonderful! I can't tell you how glad I am you're here, I don't know many people and -
But you like me, don't you? Even though you don't know who I am?
Oh, me -
Who am I? Well, let's see. Charles Foster Kane was born in New Salem, Colorado in eighteen six - I run a couple of newspapers. How about you?
Calm down. Tell me what's wrong.
Who is it?
It's Kathryn.
I... I don't think you want to know.
Cecile, you have to tell me.
Something awful happened last night.
What do you mean?!
It involves your brother. He... took advantage of me.
Does your mother know?
You hearing me?
Then we're stupid and we'll die.
It's better than it used to be. Eight years ago they still had a lynching here. They tied a man to a car and dragged him to death. My father knew who did it, but he didn't say anything.
I just want to know where he is.
What are you doing? I love your script.
Why don't I make you some of this new Mococoa Drink? All natural. Cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners--
I've tasted other cocoas. This is the best.
Unwell?
It's just an assignment.
The Collected Works of Alfred Biedermeyer
I thought you were getting me a drink?
And some taco chips so I can dunk.
Never heard of him.
Why?
Terry, I'm frightened. More and more frightened.
You know how to box?
John--
He can't prove anything, John. He can't turn us in.
What?
It doesn't matter. He was there and he let it happen. He can't take us in.
What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
What do you mean?
DON'T touch me. Just get away from me. Go!
They can always grab oranges off trees. This you can't do in Times Square...
Playing...
The room!
That help?
What do you think?
Where are you?
I moved the couch. That's all.
... Sex.
Ah.
I know that.
What about?
The house payments.
Slugs. Have faster learning curves. Trees, even.
You're saying, don't make the kids a football, don't put them through a war. But I'm doing this for their well-being.
Called him. We set an ap...
The bed looks like a dead animal act. Which one is sables?
But she just got here...
And I'm supposed to care.
I refuse to turn out like them. Twenty-one years old and they're already looking for a husband. Stupid fucking cunts with no self- esteem. They let the boys control their lives. Not me.
Everything. It is a ghastly existence.
The mold? I am living among these crypto-fascist Orange County cunts... with daddy's BMW and the boob job... just waiting to implode.
Nobody.
I want romance.
What do you want?
Romance in Ridgemont? We don't even get cable TV.
Another summer of working at Swenson's.
Come on. There's lots of men around here. Keep your eyes open.
It was beautiful. And getting better all the time.
Did you get my money?
What? What?
Oh.
What are you talking about, Raymond? Cosmo can't own the moon.
Is who down there?
What would he be doing down there?
Yeah. Hold this. It might be safer.
I'll bet!
Wilbur, he picked them for us himself...
Maybe you'll understand this, because you know John, but he confuses me sometimes.
There ve been 7 international treaties since 1904 aimed at preventing child slavery. But still no worldwide body dedicated to investigating the maltreatment of children used in sexual exploitation. Officially, it s just not called for. Sit down. Can I offer you some coffee?
A recent acquisition. We ve had four break- ins this year alone; files stolen, computers wrecked, faeces smeared on walls. The good guys dismiss us as alarmist do-gooders; the bad guys will risk prison to intimidate and rob us. An easy living indeed, Mr Lombard. I got through to Moreau and Jane. I left your landlord out of it. Your flat s been broken into. Jane wants you to call her back.
Should have blown already. Delayed fuse, that's Vietnam stuff.
I can't believe we had to give them the damn tape.
I'm just saying, you're going to be fine.
Of course you will.
I'll come back all the time.
I know that.
Don't touch me. Tell me. Just answer the question. What do I spend? What? How will we live?
It is.
Don't give me that shit. You just better do something.
I put a frozen dinner in the oven, a Manhandler. It'll be ready at a quarter of. I threw a little salad together. It's in the fridge. I also bought some apple juice, Red Cheek. Don't drink it all. Oh, and Jake, your lawyer called.
We have a Bible study meeting tonight if you'd like to come.
Are we gonna split up?
Why didn't you bring him?
You can't mean that.
But how?
How can the sphere do that?
Which I told Barnes was attacking --
But why is he doing it?
His dream? You can't control your dreams. And you can't control your fears, can you?
She does look a little peaky.
Kurt thought? What about you? Do you think anymore?
And, what, I'm not serious?
Not personal? That's my work in there, Ed. My sweat, my labor, my time. If that's not personal, I don't know what is.
How dare you take that away from me.
Burgel! -- I didn't leave it with him.
I'm collecting Eduard's things. If there's anything you want, take it or I'll give it to charity.
That's him. How do you know 'em?
Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
Ordell pick up his bond?
Just ignore him.
Well, you got it now.
I always wanted to travel. I just never got the opportunity.
Gosh. It sure is.
This is so beautiful.
Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya?
We should have just ignored him.
Oh, Christ. I hate this guy.
My mother told me just the opposite. She said, 'You weren't born with much of a body so you'd better develop your brain.'
Do you remember your Epictetus, that little homily we recited when we were children? The one that was supposed to remind us we were Romans?
"If you consider yourself to be only one thread of many in the tunic, then it is fitting for you to be like the rest of men, just as the thread has no desire to be any better than the other threads. But..."
For the sake of the Gods, you're not leading these men? How like my father you are. You 'believe'... I guess that's why you're still alive.
Yeah. Did you get some sleep?
Not really. How long are you here for?
Oh, good. Do you want to go to a party tonight with me and some friends who live here?
See you later.
You really are having a mid-life crisis.
Hold your arm out. You can't hope to be cured quickly. You heard what the doctor said. If it had been seen to in time ...This'll take time. But with the help of God, we'll pull through.
Oh my God. Tom.
I did it myself. I read a magazine article about how to maximize small spaces.
I hate to admit it, but there's something perversely satisfying about this.
Okay, okay...
Umm, I don't know. I can look it up.
Home sweet home.
No. I'll do them later.
What?
Yes.
Oh -- I was ambitious then -- ambition was in my blood -- no rest, no stopping. We were drilled like little soldiers -- We danced in the school of the Imperial Ballet, in St. Petersburg. I was little and slim but hard as diamond -- a duty machine -- No rest, no stopping. And then -- I became famous and whoever is famous is alone... But why should I be telling you this? Last night I did not know you at all -- who are you, really? -- I do not even know your name.
Flix. -- And how do you live? What kind of a person are you?
I had a good time tonight.
Lucien Baines?
Where to?
Mmm. I made good time. Pilgrim's in the back. I found a new stable, but they can't take him until tomorrow.
Great!
Go ahead...
Good.
Thank you, Royce. It was shaping up like such a tough call -- and then you go and make it so goddamn easy. Really, thank you so much.
Thank you, ensign.
Ridgeway High. How's Henley Hall, Gin?
That's your sister school, right?
You going out for the Henley Hall play? They're doing "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
And who will care for me my love, my dark angel, when you are gone?
Yet you could do it to me! Snatching me from my mother's hands like two monsters in a fairy-tale! Couldn't you have waited? Six more years and I would have had that shape! And now you weep! You haven't tears enough for what you've done to me.
Oh God! I love you still, that's the torment of it. But you know I must leave you Louis...
Hello, Brigman.
We should be dead. We didn't decompress.
Father! Thank God you're better! I really need your help. We've only got a few more hours.
What do you mean "don't worry?"
So...we won?
Beverly Hills hairdresser... what kind of a thing is that to do... you might as well be a faggot... think that's funny too?
I am not like my mother!
It's true.
I did. I came to an old dark house, and a voice called to me -- a lovely, sweet voice ---
It was on account of the birthday party.
Oh, really?
He works for the airline. He'll be out here. You'll meet him.
I don't know. Thirty to forty minutes.
What's Doug do in Chicago?
How long does Doug take?
No. But it's a nice idea.
Listen to this... it says 'Most women derive pleasure from sex, but they don't have real orgasms.'
Yeah, you'd be surprised what three years can do to a kid.
'Bout written you off. How long have you been in town?
Four months?
Stephen told him you were killed in a hot tub accident.
Dunbar says you were.
Hey, I thought I recognized you two, hi Vada.
Don t do this, Jack... But he continues...
And...?
...my feet are hurtin ...
Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
Because I know you're full of shit.
Hello...
Well, can't nobody get through nine months without sorrow.
Now don't you go gettin' nimsy-mimsy.
Look, if you want to take it in the morning, that's fine.
-- enough time tomorrow. I know.
No, I don't mean you have to. It's just that we may not have enough --
Fine -- I'll take my bath.
I don't care.
Why is he not here?
Then why send me back to them?!
I won't feel satisfied unless I got out there, Sam.
Children, come here...
Sid Fletcher.
Don't do anything, Linda. I'd rather just forget about it. I don't even like the guy.
Stacy, he's not a guy. He's a little prick!
My little girl said she'd kill you if you came to see me. I can't let you die. We'll have to hide you.
Hurry, hurry.
I really thought he would show up. I waited... and waited... and waited...
Hurry!
I can't do it! I can't do it!
Wait a minute, Mollie.
Mollie, they haven't got him. You gotta help me, Mollie! We've got to do something!
Quiet, Mollie!
Of course, she hasn't anything definite in mind.
I don't know. I'm not sure I can duplicate the level of intensity I had the other day.
I don't think my sister would agree.
Look, I'll call you, okay?
Not often, but it is possible. Most people get scared when they see the shadow of their limits. They don't know how long the shadow really is. They don't know how far away the real limits are standing... They stop out of fear.
Why didn't you just ask for directions back there?
You mean like the Donner Party?
Look at my ring.
A lady threw it to me.
To be on the safe side. I mean --
Look, it's either him or us, Norman. Another attack, and we go down with this place.
You ever given an injection before.
Only lab rats. Here.
You said you were going to get her out of this.
I made my choice, Lenny.
Good. How long ago did your wife die?
I think it's hard for him to talk to you about all this. Maybe we could talk and it would make him feel a little better.
Dr. Marcia Fieldstone of Network America.
I don't trust Harry to do it.
I fixed your suit.
You press a button, Norman. It's not brain surgery. Here, go ahead. You only have 15 minutes to reset it. Go on, Norman...
Mother .... you couldn't do that. You couldn't go to her.
I didn't say I would. But we've got to have money.
Did it ever occur to you that Chris might work?
Yes. But maybe this proves that Bates found out about the money.
That's proof Mary was here! It would be too wild a coincidence for somebody else to...
It didn't get washed down. It's figuring... the kind you tear up and get rid of. Some figure has been added to or subtracted from... forty thousand.
Hospital clean.
Will you just tell me one thing?
Okay.
Two thousand dollars.
Someday, I'll pay it all back.
I know. H-how much do you need?
Yeah.
Well, in order to get started, there's just a few things I have to buy... and some old debts I have outstanding.
Hannah, I know it's a lot, but my friend April and I, we have this catering idea I think's going to be great.
You admit that we're great cooks, right?
The antibiotics weren't working. It's what I believe, George.
That wasn't a dream. That was Sam.
My tongue around the edge of his ear is what cured him.
I'll call the police.
And what you going to do?
Plus he fell in love with a temp.
Permanent damage.
He's just laying in bed. He's pretty upset. He won't talk.
Don't worry, honey, you'll find something.
Well, I'll pay you that back sometime, Mr. Hillyer.
Actually, I don't make friends easily.
I don't know...
Why?
Well, then, what is it you exactly want to do?
Well, we're all working tonight.
If you talk to Tom, he'll assign you to something.
What did he have to do - look at the body?
And I suppose you don't feel bad!
That's impossible. A guy can't --
The innocents we now use to stop the guilty.
You think the three in the tank come from a test tube? They're merely the ones who survived.
If the unintended consequences of a series of genetic mistakes and science gone haywire can be called invention, then yes, I invented precrime.
I'm not. I was trying to heal them, not turn them into... something else.
It began as play. A guessing game like you play with any toddler, except these children always guessed right. And then the nightmares started. They were all different, but all the same. They were all about murder. And the murders were all happening.
I don't even know your name.
Like what?
I've been trying to talk to him about it. He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions.
Oh...
Yeah. I-I don't know what's wrong with him. He's just...kind of distant and difficult.
Ghastly, cruel, unnecessary.
I don't know why you still haven't bought an air conditioner.
How are you holding up in this weather?
You are too cruel to Da Mayor, it isn't right.
I have a brain.
We made a mistake. Let's not make it worse.
I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know--
...go to the park. In the worst way.
Why?
I'm thinking. Do I know you well enough to really chew you out?
No.
No.
Working.
Yeah.
Of course not. He wouldn't be.
John Doe. The one in there.
Now, look, John. Here's the speech. It's in caps and double-spaced. You won't have any trouble reading it. Not nervous, are you?
You like music?
A man might what?
Mr. Kringelein -- How you have changed, you look so nice.
No - absinthe.
Oh -- you would!
So how are you?
Yes.
Zack, do you ever think about what it'd be like to have kids... a family.
Some day. When I'm sure I can do a better job of it than my folks.
I'm so embarrassed. I knew I shouldn't have brought you here.
That's okay. I'm used to it.
So, after you graduate you go on to basic flight, right? Is that in Pensacola?
For a start, I wouldn't marry a man I wasn't in love with.
It's been a long time.
Hello, Sam.
Some of the old songs, Sam.
Worth pursuing?
Chauncey! Have you seen the papers?
Well, it seems you've been described as one of the architects of the President's speech. And your own comments from the 'This Evening' show are quoted side by side with the President's.
I'm talking to you right now. Who's Linda?
How?
You never have dessert.
What's the matter?
I shouldn't.
Don't you?
What's the phrase -- "keeping up with the Joneses"?
Home! Meet me at the office. We've got to do something ... you've got to do something Adam!
Sergeant Major? How is Richie doing? Private Graves?
Yeah, yeah, I sorta dabble around, you know.
I don't care to bargain.
I don't want to go back.
Excuse me.
I don't believe that. I think you are insulted by me, somehow. You're a foreigner too, aren't you, here, in this market?
We raised such a fuss they finally brought cots in.
You getting this?
But they've still got Laura Gordon -- and she was the closest, about 20 feet from the killer.
I wouldn't like.
If you'd like.
You mustn't mind Margo too much, even if I do...
In a minute...
The reason is Margo and don't try to figure it out. Einstein couldn't.
But there must be some reason, something I've done without knowing...
Well maybe it needs to be messed with. Did that ever like--occur to you? You know, they don't want to be like this, it's just that nobody ever helped them before.
Too young for what?
You're not getting any younger, Mark. The world is changing, music is changing, even drugs are changing. You can't stay in here all day dreaming about heroin and Ziggy Pop.
Whatever. I mean, the guy's dead anyway.
Ask them to wait a little longer. For the twins.
No.
No! Sit down now.
Pike never confessed.
Remain calm.
I'll be right back.
What size?
What size?
I'm going to live right here. As long as I have to.
I don't my plans myself.
You've got a private office here, haven't you?
Mr. Carter, this is Mr. Bernstein. Mr. Bernstein is my general manager.
Oh. Elijah Price came to visit me at the center today.
I'm sorry.
Dad??
Dad?
Nick, you'd better lay off that liquor.
Oh.
I'm not sure.
Well...
I'm going back up tonight. Will you go with me?
I know.
I don't think I'd notice. I'm so used to Carl.
Why are you being so mean?
You know, he was formerly a sailor.
Oh, Maddy, grow up. It says in LOVE WITHOUT FEAR that "the tongue kiss as a means of genital stimulation is widely practiced and has much to commend it". Page eighty six.
"The Kon-Tiki in motion was a little different from what it usually was in such conditions. We had become sensitive to changes in the rhythm of the logs. I thought at once of suction from the coast, which was drawing near, and was continually out on the deck and up the mast..."
Yes --
Yes...
You're out looking here?
Shut up, you!
Run down and get some smelling salts, will you?
Came up here -- had hysterics and passed out. I've been trying to get her to come to.
Give me a hand with her, will you?
I said: Are you sure? You seem unsure.
You've made your point.
What was I wearing?
Egad, were you horrified?
But I'm not.
Sleep well?
I was lonely. You took advantage
Why did yo do this for me?
Well, that's nice.
Mrs. Frank?
I'd like to talk to you about Madison.
Toby! Toby Tyler, leave him alone!
I'm so sorry.
You're next, Norman.
You have it.
That's just mean. Oh. Jody wanted to know if I could get her some.
Well -- I am worried about the way you've changed. That was one thing you said you'd never do -- remember?
I'm tired of being stuck in that wagon.
So J.D., what are you studying in school?
Thelma! I'm not gonna talk about this! Now find another way or give me the goddamn map and I will! You understand?
No, Louise. How come you never said what happened?
I was thinking maybe I shouldn't be in therapy anymore.
What about obsessively picking her split ends?
Last week when she chopped her Barbie's bangs all to hell --
She was angry at herself.
Good. Now, if you'll pardon me, I have to go to work.
What you got a picture of your heart for?
I didn't think you'd show your face around me again. I figured you were humiliated. You did run away, after all.
What do you mean? I don't understand.
I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
I'm late... and you have to put your shoes on.
Isn't Mr. Lowery back from lunch?
It'll pass. Headaches are like resolutions... you forget them soon as they stop hurting.
Were there any calls?
Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot!
That's all right, Miss Pilbow, if Mister McMurphy does not wish to take his medication orally, he may...
The refridgerator.
No, no of course not. It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake.
You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother.
They can't find a sitter... Hello? Excuse me? Yes, uh, hold on. Just a moment. It's Skye Davidson. She needs directions to the house. You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party?
Well, it might be Clair. They're threatening not to come...
And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.
No, no of course not. How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two?
That wasn't in there before.
I'm a woman. I don't theorize. I only deal with facts.
I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals.
I wasn't helping you for money.
Why didn't you? You knew she was keeping her home from school. You knew she was an alcoholic.
Oh God, if only I'd known.
Do you know what she did to her?
Listening to angels?
Yes.
There is more here than meets the eye isn't there? Lots of dirty little secrets.
Oh, dear God.
She molested her!
I don't think I care to know.
I want you to take this... to remember by.
OK, OK! Excuse me! How old were you when you had your first contract?
...OK. I love you anyway.
When I say I love you.
...You don't believe me, don't you?
I'm not afraid of the fire anymore. It will purify me...
I'm staying, Jean.
It's just my stupid way of getting attention! God, I practically love you, Josh!
You've never once said anything even remotely nice to me.
That's just the way I am!
"Yeah, right"... well why not? What's so wrong with me?
Then why do you hate me so much?
I'm Josie. Geller. I think the school would probably be pretty comfortable with you calling, me that. Josie.
I do have a right to ask you to be a little bit better than me and your father because we gave you a better head start. You have no right to complain to us about your not having enough. You sit right there with your no manners self.
Uh...Didn't we do this?
Drive? I'm not old enough yet.
I can't...
I don't know if I can with my leg.
The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ. I ought to have it taken out.
Daddy, what's the matter?
What is it, Daddy --?
Your folks live there?
In Birmingham.
Yes, aren't you?
You want... a free one.
Your wife?
Everybody's rich.
What the fuck is that shit?
Ready when you are.
It's not that we wanted to deceive anyone -- but you know how these things are looked upon at the office.
They've taken your clothes?
Yeah, they have these banks, you know, where they keep them frozen.
It appears to be dirty -- why don't you get somebody?
Jim, dinner's just about ready... I've got a surprise for you... tried something new... Jim? Jim, dinner.
I want to experience childbirth.
He'll wander back when he's sober and apologize. He always does.
Have you ever cleaned your apartment?
It's only been described to me. In your books.
Hello -- hello! Is this the Lying -- In Hospital? Did you have an auto accident in the last --
Oh, I see. I beg your pardon.
Yes.
I don't care what you say. I'm going to find Bruce's mother. Oh-h... I'm going out and find her!
Who says so? I'm going to the morgue -- to look --
I know. I like it this way -- makes me look the way I feel.
We've just lived through a century of incredible violence and self- destruction. Do you call it 'interventionist' when you stop a toddler from walking in front of a truck?
Your phone.
What are you talking about? Who are you?
They are singing for me.
What's he been in?
My Leica's gone.
Where are you going?
At least she's alive.
No.
Sounds delightful. Who the fuck is John Malkovich?
It better be.
I bet your mom sang to you.
Yes, of course, he knew, but at the time, he felt -- we both felt their existence was... an insignificant variable.
So one day we'll meet.
You need the money just like we do.
Either pull the trigger or get that thing out of my face.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think --
Not until he has the money!
Lick me.
Don't go on like this. Now if Benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out --
-- then I'll simply invite all the Robinsons' over for dinner on Thursday.
Nothing. It wasn't anything. I've been on edge lately. Maybe since the accident. And I'd prefer, I really would, to just--
They will -- and so will you if you go on swearing like that.
Yeh, better I should forcefeed him burnt lamb and...couscous, was it she made him? Boy, kids go wild for that.
What's wrong?
You'd better call and cancel.
And why was the alarm on?
It was an unfair fight. He didn't have a chance. I'm taking a real gamble. I loved him for a long, long time.
Yep. It's going to be a law. I broke up with Charlie last night.
Jogging. I was running, now I'm jogging.
Hi, Richard.
I've seen him.
What other people?
A few times. Sometimes I sit in that coffee shop across the street and watch when you take him to school.
You have no idea where you've just come from? What you've just done?
Oh yes, she's... wonderful.
What brought you down here, Greg?
Well, I'm glad you came to see me.
Did Teddy send you?
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again... Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
I said Sidney!...
I thought we were talking about Sidney?
Yes.
I wish you wouldn't take the dog with you, David -- he's likely to be a burden to you.
Here's your food -- now you go straight to that place -- if you need to rest, go into a church or railroad station -- but don't go into nobody's house, you hear me?
Yes.
I'm not wearing underwear. Okay? There, I said it. Satisfied.
I drown, you tow me back to the rig--
And we all went through that together?
And what are you, his chaperone?
Granma's dead.
When I finally get kissed, I'll know.
And what's the occasion of this celebration?
An invitation?
Ah-hah, I see. A cozy dinner. But aren't threesomes a little awkward? How does the phrase go--
And how many people will be attending this birthday party?
Truth is, besides the headache I've come down with a little lower intestinal havoc. Make my apologies.
All right, I'll do it.
But I want to make some changes. Get Krista in here right away won't you?
Long story. Not that interesting.
Maybe once. I re-wrote it, anyway.
Mmm-more like -- I have a little trouble. Trusting people.
They just pushed up the schedule on Skywire apps. How fast are you going?
Mine's not the CEO. He barely remembers to take a shower.
I don't understand...
Uncertainty makes you uncomfortable.
I'm tryin', baby, so don't start gettin' mad now.
Dickie!
Where are you taking us?
Happy for him. And relieved.
We hear how Carl...passed away. Only a few hours later.
Closer to eight.
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
I'm going to go get my swimsuit. I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. Ryan, you're a great man.
Pigsty.
I can't talk right now.
My dad died. My dad, my dad.
Pig died.
No --
Alan was not...unbalanced when I married him. And he was not...'indifferent to women' no matter what they said! HUNSECKER I'm not fighting with you, puss...
No.
-- yes, honey, you've got to get out of here.
Please, we'll have to talk later --
Forget about last night, it's okay, we'll talk when I get back --
Look -- either you leave or I leave because I don't want the two of us here when Lester arrives. I just don't --
Tell me about your adopted MOTHER
Oh, but the winter's fun. There's the wind and the snow. You'll like the warm fire upon the hearth, and the long, long nights.
Your children?
My dolls. We can pretend.
All right, Amy. Button your sweater, darling. It's turning cold.
Yes, winter's coming. I don't like the winter,
But we don't have any sea weed.
Pretend, darling. It's All Soul's Eve. Round about the fire we go... Over the flames we leapt
No, I don't think that's very much fun. Let's play house instead. You be the friend who comes to see me. I'll show you my children.
True.
You have no right to keep us here.
Through the sweats or not?
I think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.
Hardly...
In the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.
But you're his brother.
I think you have your answer.
You were supposed to be reading words.
What the child?
Everything... I don't have children.
... and that you don't believe you carried a child.
I was a mistake.
... that you don't remember getting pregnant...
Not my fault.
Agnes, I don't believe you know nothing about sex...
I can't help it if I'm stupid.
Is that what she said?
If you're trying to get me to say that she was a bad woman and hated me and didn't want me but that's not true, she was a good woman, a saint...
You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
I would if I knew where I was taking him.
So what's wrong with that?
Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
So what are you going to do?
And I love the inscription you wrote to me. Only I'm not quite the downy innocent you think I am.
I just mean, I -- I guess Emily isn't going to be there when you get home.
Some things must never change.
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.
Something like that.
Kristina's fine.
Aha! You love him.
It's extremely complicated, and I'd rather not talk about it in my fragile state.
So, what was it like humping Bleeker's bony bod?
So, you were bored? Is that how this blessed miracle came to be?
Nah, it was a premeditated act. The sex, I mean, not getting pregnant.
When did you decide you were going to do Bleeker?
Like, a year ago, in Spanish class.
You're not a doctor, you'll hurt him!
Why do men chase women?
How's that?
Can you see it?
Martin, damnit, what are you up to? Let go of me!
You lost your head, it happens. I'm so fuckin jazzed! Listen. I'm going to have to fly to Chicago tomorrow, how 'bout if we meet in the Dallas airport and we all fly into New York together for the draft?
Don't worry about it -- I never told you what I thought of that memo either --
We're doing what we can for her. But it doesn't look good.
I am, too.
It's horrible. They burned her breasts with cigarettes. Christ.
I'm not talking about the fucking Church. Fuck the Church. But tell me. Do you believe in God?
Just, hurry.
Okay on the count of three.
Just do it.
Say something it's too quiet.
A "mystery guy!" "Not a passenger." Who?
There's an ATM on Speedwell Avenue.
It's Craig in there, I can tell.
Daddy, wait.
Not exactly.
See ya' Chuckie. I had fun.
I thought you said you'd show me your place.
I can't believe they decided you won.
Good seeing you again.
Why are you doing this to me?
How'd you know it was me?
Burned out. I need a vacation.
A girl could get killed - - so they tell me. What's new and hot in Gotham City?
Evildoers, huh? Big or small?
Nothing you can do. Been like this for days.
Now you stay put!
hurries over.
Ryan, would you rather swim or work?
Oh, honey. There's not much to do there. I mean, it's all work.
You can go back to bed...or Lois might let you go swimming.
Not all day. I'll be home after lunch.
I thought I might stop by.
I'll get something for us to drink --
...But first I gotta know what happened.
He wants help with his lines --
Daddy guess what I beat Thomas J in monopoly yesterday.
Not use my words, please!
And youdon't tell her. What you're going to say.
That's because your mother is a fine person, finer than I will ever be. Now, just this once...
And Mom says anger never, never solves anything. It makes every- thing worse.
...laughed, yeh. They laughed real hard.
No, his mother's always on time.
Now is that little prick still here, because if he is, I'm gonna rip his fucking heart out!
That is lingerie.
Really?
Bridgework?
Very romantic.
Eww, he's all beardy!
Life is so goddamn wonderful, you almost won't believe it.
It's just a goddamn bowl of cherries, I'm sure.
I had better call Daddy.
He's wearing a suit again, I don't know why he's wearing a suit, he doesn't usually dress like that --
It's fine.
Oh, yeah? What is this, anyway? Let me see. Okay, let's... oooh, God! Oh, you knew I wanted this... God, it's terrific, God!
What... huh?
Oh! My God!
Yeah, well, we have the, I mean, they were just a terrific audience, I mean, you know, it makes it really easy for me, because I can be... huh?
I thought I'd try it. You look good.
I still don t buy your story but I figured it can t do any harm to let you go on with your enquiry. Besides, if you do turn out to be nothing but a cheap little extortioner, we could always get the right people onto you. I trust you know who I am talking about.
Hi.
No ...
Yes she is.
George --
No. No, I guess not. I don't want to get bruised. You're right, I should go.
And don't forget you have a breakfast meeting with Frederick Bennet and Charles Rust at '21.
Shit happens, and your life changes. 'Bout the best explanation of a lot of things that happen. So how come you don't know where you're coming from?
I do it.
Matthew's my grandson.
He does bless me, each and every day. Matthew's mother works a hospital shift, so I pick him up at school. We stop for a meal usually around this time. He does his homework and gets some experience meeting people. But we never had a famous mobster before.
This is one charming crook. If shooting people is charming.
That's a simple subject.
Yeah.
And if you're wrong?
Joel, Joely, look... it's not fading. The memory. I think we're hidden.
I'm right here.
Where?
What about the car?
Cause you know goddamn well who I am.
You've lived with me for two years.
What do you want me to say? My mother's tummy?
No, I didn't know that.
No.
Craig stole Maxine from me, Dr. Lester.
No, you don't understand. I've been inside Malkovich when I'm with Maxine...
Yeah, I'm real glad you brought that up. I was going through your file here, and I ran into these medical records. They kinda surprised me --
Cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know -- you're making all new curtains. Honest to God, I don't know if I have the energy. You know, I've been sick. Me and Peter both have.
Yeah? I should learn to do stuff like that. They make the place feel real homey.
I added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...
Right.
Hell, no. I hate lawyers. I just work for them. You got a minute?
You're a lawyer?
Well it oughta be, with all the work I put into it.
This is a real nice place you got here.
Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
Sometimes they do.
"Minor glitch" with you seems to turn into a major catastrophe.
What's happening?
The Queen has consented?
Didn' none of these have no breakfast?
Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup.
You want to get ast to eat, hunh?
Didn' you have no breakfast?
On a gallon a gas? Let's set up the tent. Maybe I can fix us up some stew.
I wish we did. You married?
Why are we leaving?
I'll get you through. Move and smile. And smile and move...
Come on, I'll buy you a drink. There's a big thing over at the Italian embassy.
No, I'm not. I'm the fourth. Joan Richmond. Pauline Fredericks got that credit once on a U.N. special and there's Susan Zirinsky.
It's much too soon for you to have this kind of buzz around you.
I'll be the judge of that.
I don't know how you do it. I've never even dated anybody but Charlie.
Are you here?
I want to keep my teeth.
I'm not getting away with anything, Bobo.
I was down on that horse, Bobo. Not as much as I should have been, but there was a lot of action on those--
They don't care about you anymore. Alive or dead is the same, as long as they bury you deep enough.
whips off her pinny as HERBERT leads Juliet into the dining room.
Come on! Sausage rolls.
and Pauline hurriedly work together, setting out plates and cutlery.
Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
Neither had I. Odd desire for a woman, I guess.
Well. A couple of years ago when their president was requesting aid I went down there for Newsweek. The beaches were nice. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced on the hotel patio. Of course I never saw what was really happening there. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away.
... Terror.
Thanks a lot.
Well, Bruce, some types are a little more obvious than others.
Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you.
Benjamin, when you came up here, what did you think was going to happen between us?
Let me tell you something. Martin Swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.
Look, I'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a Saturday night. This isn't about fun. I'm working here.
Bullshit. Marty's plan is only about efficiency. I've got two cousins on the job, you think I'd work for him if I didn't believe in it?
Why do you think Marty came here tonight? Because he cares about your department. You don't know how hard he works. You don't know about his programs helping West Side --
I'm not having any more children. After Amado, I had some complications-- I can't get pregnant again, if that's what the rule is about--
Everything that went before, all that stuff, that history--the hell with it, right?
We start from scratch--
No problem. We'll just sell another baseball card.
I know.
Well, another day, another dollar. Stop staring at me!!
Night!
It's your life. And, by the way, it's a dandy.
Please let me go with you.
Where do we look for little lost Puff?
That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No?
Okay, my sweet. Good night.
You're so clever.
I'm just tired.
All right, well get to bed early and don't let anybody in. Bye.
I'm a prisoner in them. Until the gunshot sets me free.
Yes.
We think?
Why don't you answer?
You can go now.
I'm doing okay. Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
Don't Duff--
I won't ask you to.
Smokey told me he left last night to look at some horses in Sheriden. He won't be back for three days. I can't believe he didn't want to say goodbye.
You actually forgot our anniversary.
Get away from me!
No....
Who's that?
Maybe something happened to them. Maybe they're lying in an alley bleed to death.
Chet, you don't have to hurt him.
Because God loves a winner.
Do you need a break?
Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
You drive a hard bargain, Mr Lombard.
Soon. We're going to Branson, Missouri to see my cousin Emma married. Frank loves in there.
You and Frank ever take a vacation?
Is there milk in them already?
Well -- I was prepared for worse, but it wasn't so bad. We were sitting at the bar, talking about blackjack. You seemed just fine, a little drunker than usual, but nothing really strange, but then your head started to droop and I put my arm on your shoulder and then, wham, you swung you arm at me, and fell backwards off your stool into a cocktail waitress. You smashed everything on her tray, it was a real mess. You kept yelling and yelling.
How are you doing?
I expect some kind of loyalty here. Just because I fuck for money doesn't give you cause to start picking up women and leaving me looking silly.
Launch the Da Vinci virus? You can't do that!
I tried to shut you up and help you to your feet but you kept swinging at me -- not like you wanted to hit me, but more just waving me away. Security came and when you saw them you stopped yelling. They wanted to carry you out and dump you on the street, but I talked them into letting me walk you out.
Hors d'oeuvres or something?
They had a large chunk of the garbage file? How much do they know?
I hurt you?
How about, he sees her on the street, he wipes the soot from his eyes. He goes up to her. "What happened to the horse?" She looks at him. She takes his hand...
Yes, great! It's a beautiful house.
I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired.
Huh.
Why did you come here?
Not her brand.
You look alike.
That's Mr. Bixler, let's go talk to him.
Yes.
Nice to see you again, Edna.
You didn't know you had a fairy godmother, did you?
To the demon king's castle, of course.
A fairy godmother, all of your own. Aren't you lucky?
You want to say some words?
Frank, why don't you go off and play in your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty.
...His majesty was quite keen that you should understand --
What are you going to do?
What will happen if I do?
Can't you make it later?
I heard about it. You're lucky he lived.
I'm glad they let you out.
I want you back too, Viktor.
-- And she was positively glowing at the awards. I should be going, she'll be here soon --
I just read somewhere --
I'm sure you'll keep her focussed. She's lucky to have you, Viktor. Is she really having your baby?
I suppose I could stay, just until she arrives.
Is Simone back to earth yet?
What's a demur?
Until it withers away.
Why is that?
You're weird.
That was a compliment.
Where are we going?
I won't. And when I tell Drew about it, he won't either.
I don't want to talk about it...
No... I really don't want to talk about it.
You really don't remember?
It was weird...
Sid. You must be a very important executive.
You'll keep the car. I'll take a bus... Am I going up there with you... in your ship... up there?
Then let me go. You don't need me.
That's not much time. I'll just slow you down. I have to sleep. I'm very tired. And I have to wash and eat. You don't...
I won't tell anybody if that's what you're worried about. I promise. You'll keep...
Do you understand what I'm saying to you? You can keep the car. That should be enough for gas from here to there. Please let me go.
I feel like I'm going crazy here. You're Scott. But he's dead. I don't know what's real anymore. I can't be here with you.
Yes.
It's not about being happy. You and I can't -
Really? I thought he said it all the time.
Alright. I want you to leave and go back to New York.
If that's a problem, then I'll make arrangements to stay with some friends.
Nothing.
I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me.
No. No. I am sorry. Forget everything I say. Here. I will take the tray.
You will not hurt him?
Because he's my friend, too.
I'd like to come with you.
No! That's not true!
Thanks. The F-14 is one of the most difficult planes to master. Oh, you call them 'Tomcats' and in the 70's the first crop had a number of crashes.
Yes?
We're going to George. Say 'the Joint Chiefs are meeting -- we have George Weln at the Pentagon'.
Not a lot.
At any rate I arrived in town not ten days ago, full of dreams and aspirations, anxious to make my way in the world --
What a horrible little person.
Oh, all right.
It sure was.
...now it gets positively spooky. In January, 1961 - in New Orleans, at the Bolton Ford Dealership - when the Oswald we know is in Russia - there is a man using the name "Oswald" to buy trucks for the Friends of Democratic Cuba. The salesman never saw him again, but guess who's on the articles of incorporation of the Friends of Democratic Cuba? Guy Banister. Banister has someone using the name "Oswald" to buy the trucks. Hoover, at the FBI, writes a memo dated June, 1960, that there could be someone using Oswald's passport and identity.
There!
Come here.
I can't.
And what did you do tonight, honey?
And what did you do tonight, honey?
That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his "mad" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey?
So he's doing okay?
You were gone a long time.
Well, I haven't come around.
Don't look so scared.
What about your boy?
We'll be all right.
I keep thinking about him.
Is this an act -- or are you addicted to causing trouble??
Then stop treating me like a fucking prop.
"There's no shame in getting a little therapy", right, Doc?
But I don't know who they are.
I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?
I'm fine. My dad said you tore your ACL.
Shouldn't you be lying down, or...
No, it looks good. I mean, it's cool.
I was. I see your peach fuzz finally grew in.
Sure, Norville, sure...
-- You were with her. You were in the cab, weren't you?
What did you do with her?
Oh-h-h... was she hurt?
No. That's all. You made a dollar, an' that's a dollar's worth.
Occasionally.
How long will it take?
Can I see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what --
How do we start?
Is white an expression of innocence? Do you crave innocence LESLIE?
But be serious, darling. You are in danger and you must leave Paris.
I hate it. I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. This is right. This is real. Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts. Please don't tell anyone about what happened. "Sleepless in Seattle" is history.
I love the symphony.
We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
Hello, Nick! And a party - celebrating father's third murder -
Oh... oh... oh! I think... maybe... one of 'em... was Foster... but I don't hardly know him!
How do you know there is a Grand Hotel?
Spotted you, Chief. Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows. Over.
Fine.
Great, I have so much to say, I hardly know where to start.
Stop it! Goddamnit, I mean it! Louise is gonna wonder where I am. Let go!
Don't hurt me. Harlan. Please.
That guy Graham I told you about. He said taking advice from someone you don't know intimately was... well, he said a lot of stuff.
No fooling on base, no signs, no comments, no talk. By anyone.
I thought you were going to bed?
Just shut up, Evan. You're wasting your breath.
Who are you trying to convince, Evan?! You come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? You want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? Well fuck you, Evan! Nothing's gonna be all better! Okay?! Nothing ever gets better!
Oh, I don't know. My unemployment checks are running out. Um, I was thinking of taking some courses at Columbia with the last of my savings.
Thank you --
Oh. Oh, my.
Think it'll work?
At being a fake.
Well, at least you're accomplished at something...
You had no inner feeling?
No, you're very good at it. I'm really impressed.
But that's living like an animal
But you wanted to fuck me first.
Oh, just that he loves her. That she's the only woman who has ever really rocked his world. How he adores Siena. How he wants to move up here and get a place with the two of them and commute when he has to.
A little too tight, eh? ...They were my son s. Only thirteen and already six feet tall. A real lanky boy... I... There s some cold chicken salad in the fridge if you re hungry.
Right... Well, I ll get your money first thing in the morning, okay? Okay. Goodnight then.
Don t fall asleep with your hair wet.
Give me the ball.
I need some nutmeg, flour, eggs, sugar, and...
I wanted to talk to you, and I have one last thing to take care of at school. Then I'm going to... Good dog, Rusty. Good dog.
You mean, again?
I'm telling him in the morning after breakfast.
Steve, my brother isn't as bad as he's painted. He isn't perfect, but -
Is there any chance?
I know him. That's Noel.
The season is a long way off, Mr. Howard, and by that time, Nathan oughta be home. If he ain't, believe me -- the children and me -- we will grow the crops. We have to because we owe you all that money -- Mr. Howard.
It's not so rare. He grew up on our street. He's had a rough life and he's a little crazy from it, but that's no excuse for not giving someone a lousy cup of water.
Is it contagious? 'Cause everyone agrees my immune system's way down.
Can I ask you something? Didn't you tell my dad you didn't think it was a good idea to come to the patient? So what changed?
I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying.
You have the best answer for everything. You seem so... hopeful. Are you always this sunny?
What did he do this time?
That's not even true. I just want a slice.
So?
Yes. And no more evasive tactics.
See, Daddy.
Do you think that Wynant did it?
Yeah, I do. A helluva lot more than I trust you.
NO! YOU CAN'T HAVE ME. KILL ME.
You don't remember you did. But I'm sure you remember running like some fucking hero to get Harry, don't you? You remember that.
Yeah, and I'm never going to smoke another cigarette.
Do you realize you're more interested in this old goober than you ever were in me?
It's not -- what's a 422?
Oh...and I thought it was a matter of life and death.
Can't you wait till I'm dummy?
Really, I'm impressed.
That's a dreadful shirt you're wearing.
What for?
Have you forgotten about Eve? What she is, what she's done?
Beats getting paid in twenties by slimedogs selling angel dust to high school seniors.
Eddie, I'm not working on this case. You boys have fun.
So what'd this guy do? Snitch off a dealer?
You're doing a murder case?
Oh, Henry, no, that's just boring.
But Mr. Richards and Mr. Sampson-
They'll do as they're told.
Me too. Sounds swell.
It isn't a story - it's true. I did see Wynant. He's not dead.
I'm lot going to stay here to be insulted -
Not to take soldiers for a hundred bucks. But how about taking a bank president for a hundred grand?
Same reason I put explosives around the habitat. For defense. For the power. To protect myself.
I'd never tell you to sell those. I bought them for my daughter.
Oh yes. Why, you told me to sell them a long time ago.
What bonds?
I don't like him.
I thought you'd given up that sort of friend.
He's not anybody. Just a fellow I used to know.
Me too. I got a stomach full of Xanax. I took what was left of a bottle. Might've been too much.
I got it all figured out, I know she went to Wilson High School, so first thing tomorrow, I'm gonna go there and get a copy of her yearbook. That way I can get the names of all the people she was in clubs with and found out who her friends were.
He thought it was cute when I called him Frankenstein. It wasn't. I feel like his monster.
They say I'm lucky because I can't remember the accident.
What happened to summer?
What's wrong?
Yeah, that's so.
Yes.
Yes.
I didn't take your pills.
She seems rather an odd woman to me.
Redi's all right.
I can imagine.
Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
He doesn't want to sleep here. Neither do I. It's not my house anymore.
But I like teaching school.
I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
Say goodbye, Mike.
I'd like to make another tape.
He's a liar. But that's not the worst part of it -- the worst part is -- I still love him.
Absolutely nothing.
No -- and you don't know that your cheap boss has had Mr. Baldwin arrested again -- do you?
Tell her to have a nice trip.
Earl, you don't want to hurt your friends, do you?
Do say hello to your mother.
You don't like this, I take it?
He doesn't give a damn about me.
Thanks, Patrick.
Yes?
Ummm...what? I didn't hear you.
That's hamburger grease, Bill.
In the house. I was scared.
No. Can you drive me home? I'll bring you back in the morning.
Oh.	And huge portable radios. Everything else gets small, but for some reason, portable radios get enormous.
Richard! They don't have any! They never heard of them! Isn't that wonderful?
Not for you. Okay, there's lots more.
Oh, Mom!
No! I thought you believed in me! It was all a lie!
Tell me it isn't true?! Tell me you didn't do this for the money!
I want you to do this work.
I wouldn't worry about money. I'll make it worth your while.
I don't care.
What are you doing?
The wave of the future! I've decided on our first fortune! I'll see you later. You just think high tech.
Let me go! Godammit, Frank let go!
It was a place to start.
You used to like to touch me -- to make love to me.
Frank -- stop it! Stop it!
I don't want our lives ruined because of this. I love you, Frank. I want this to work -- but you have to help me. You have to come back from where ever it is you are.
Yes I am.
Oh, please, I have to go. I have to get my teeth cleaned.
Hi. How's she doing?
Look, don't do anything on my behalf. I live with Frederick, and Hannah and I are close.
Oh, Elliot, please! I can't be a party to this! I'm suddenly wracked with guilt just standing her talking to you on the street!
Married.
Mister McMurphy, you are deliberately violating the rules!...
You men remain seated!
Maybe at Christmas, New Year's. If not this New Year's, maybe next New Year's.
Here. Be careful with those.
No, really, I really like him a lot.
Not this Thanksgiving, you know.
Mmm.
Hannah will invite some men over who don't look like Ichabod Crane.
We quarreled. She never dared get angry or frightened -- but I said things to her -- it was an attack, I know it was.
No, no, no that's not it at all. Alvy's giving an award on television. Gee, he talks like he's violating a moral issue sitting here.
God.
... You needn't worry about being attractive here.
Because...
Why does it matter whether you're fat or not...
I'm a blimp.
Agnes...
I am, there's too much flesh on me.
Daddy --
Are you relieved?
I haven't any money but I'll get a job and --
Who told you this?
No he doesn't. He hates fat people.
We were supposed to have dinner at Tad and Maura's, but-you know how Luis is...
That's nice.
Isn't that special? Patrick?
You never noticed.
Listen...Patrick. Can we talk?
Would you like to talk about it?
Are you all right?
Oh... I'm sorry. Was I singing again?
It may be work but it's not honest work. Faith is the real work.
I'm glad we're having this talk.
Your problem is you take the easy way out. Losing is easy.
My own undercover feature - "Written by Josie Geller".
You don't think I can do it.
Jos - Maybe you should turn it down.
What a loser she must be. Anyhow, Court's invited me to the Hamptons for Labor Day Weekend.
That's great.
He's alright. He kept talking about this bulimic headcase he dumped over Fourth Of July.
Really? Bulimic headcase.
So, rumor has it that you went on a date with Court Reynolds. I hear he's very nice.
You think so? I don't know. I guess I'm just scared.
I think you should visit your son. And try and get your boss to write a note about your performance on the job. You need to create the impression of a responsible, decent citizen with familial responsibilities who happened to slip up once.
Uh, I know you're having financial difficulties, Mister LaPlante, but I wonder if... I mean, the money I loaned you...
I lay awake nights in a cold sweat, I want this party to be like some- thing Mom would have made for you, I want it to be perfect --
Because I like you so much. Now I've got to go.
Ha...
Ain't brain surgery.
Well, did you ever think about hiring a business manager?
Nick?
Get away from me!
Hey, George. You okay?
She's getting big. Getting her own ideas.
Hey, look. You start paying, who knows what will happen. You're a good father, George. I always gave you that. But you've got to talk to her.
Yeah? I better see some money out of it.
I haven't seen one dollar from you. You haven't paid me one cent in child support, alimony.
...What happened?
Let me look.
Let me hold it, or you'll have a real shiner.
...I'm sorry.
Norville... there's something I have to tell you. You see, I'm not really a secretary.
Never mind. Let him alone. He's all right. I'll be right over there pulling for you.
Goodbye and thanks.
Doesn't sound like me.
Well, sounds like me. Sorry, man. Says you were jealous and suspicious.
You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next.
Good.
That's it then.
Well cheer, why don't you? No more responsibilities, Mary. Marcia -- Elaine -- me -- all taken care of. Down there feeding horses and raising kids, you won't have a thing to worry about.
Maybe you are. I'm not.
I'm sure of this. But not of you. You won't open any joint. I've been watching you change. You're mad now and you think you can change back. But you can't. You'll end up making beds in a boarding house.
Sounds fine. Only that isn't how it's going to be.
-- Gaslights and a dance floor and a big bar. Cash registers with bells and a couple of boys with armbands just to keep 'em ringing. What do you think of that?
Yes, I do, Will.
Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team?
Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things.
If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
No. I'm running to.
Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all -- If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
No no! He never calls the cops, not after we give him the blow-off.
Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
Not.
"In the church when you need me." Was there ever a saint who hid in the Church?
So why follow me? Escort me, by all means. Following me is predatory, isn't it?
Darling, for goodness' sake!
What?
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.
What happened to them?
Stop what? Don't blame me. It's not me.
I want it back now. I never should have taken it off, I want it back.
Gear shift.
Well, maybe it'll only be temporary, but I ha--I have to try.
Ah... no...
What?
Steering wheel.
Steering wheel...
How do you do? I came here - and I made Mr. Kane come with me... because I recieved this note -
I was wondering.
Josh said...
Are you sure you're totally into guys?
Does everything have to have a point?
Not really.
What's your name?
I hope it's the right kind.
Hello. Can I help you?
That's what she called him on the show. Because he can't sleep.
No, I've never seen him before.
Ellen Straub.
And now 2,000 women want his number. The guy could be a crackhead, a psychopath, a flasher, a junkie, a transvestite, a chain-saw murderer, or someone really sick, like Rick.
Oh, for pity's sake...
Well, you have to simply tell me, that's all.
Do you have to let me get halfway through the movement first? This is tiring me.
Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
Does this mean you're going to be gone more?
Like what?
Guess I got a little scattered.
How do you do it? Every night?
And two more times tomorrow night, and two more times the next night, and the next night and the next night and the next night. Frank, I can't sing that fucking song anymore!
Well, I am working on my thesis.
I've lived in L.A. all my life, I've never done this drive.
I...
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
No.
You guys have done a nice job. How bout five dollars?
Baby, I'm gonna go tell 'em not to disturb us for the rest of the year. I get back in that room, you better be wearing nothing but a candy cane.
Now what is it? Where's the fire?
Sam, they don't want to prosecute, they just want the money back. It was all in cash...
Do we have a garden? Hah! Tomorrow, Chauncey, you will see our gardens.
Pushing the legal limit even then.
That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
And I'm Ben.
Do you hear him? Do you?
Oh, thank you, sir.
Not that I've seen.
Thursday's fine...
You have been away. Or is all this just new to you?
Great!
Wade.
It is tragic! Or it will be... if we go on meeting in shabby hotels whenever you can find a tax-deductible excuse for flying down deductible here...
Can you?
You couldn't be a criminal if you committed a major crime.
I have to go, Sam.
No.
I mean Your Majesty, they do not, they have not, but I believe there is one who can
The only one?
What?
Thank you.
You...
Don't be a rat, Harry.
I thought Amy was calling. I guess not.
My daughter, Barbara, died when she was six. That was long ago. You're only the woman who keeps care of me. I know you.
Look at me.
A bit rapidly. I don't care what you say about David, he's a perfectly fine teacher!
Tell her to forget it - I don't need her help.
What is it now?
She's dead isn't she?
Yes.
What did you do?
I breathed!
What did you do?
I'm always bad.
You can tell me.
I can't.
Agnes. What did your mother do to you? If you can't answer me, just shake your head yes or no. Did... did she hit you? Did she make you do something you didn't want to? Did it make you feel uncomfortable to do it? Did it embarrass you? Did it... did it hurt you? What did she make you you do?
No...
Let's move into this neighborhood.
Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.
Do you know her poem that starts "Seaside gusts of wind, And a house in which we don't live...
Yeah, maybe.
Male or female?
Oh.
Yes?
I'll be right down.
Lloyd, what happened...?
I wouldn't want you to marry me just to prove something.
I - I don't know, Bill. Just a feeling, I don't know...
Bill... ... where are you going? To find Eve?
Stick a fork through me! I'm done. I'll never get this speech right.
I suppose so.
To dander. Otis.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Whatever.
She...she was a friend of mine.
You really want to make banal chit- chat like that now?
We're in the middle of a murder case --
Mama, shut up!
Maybe we should split it up now.
What if we get separated? Way I see it if something happens I want to be carrying my share.
I wish to be alone.
Really? What is that, an order, private?
Yeah.
But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled?
It'll get better now.
No more dentists, no more dentists...
I tell you this is half sold.
Benjamin -- I thought I made myself perfectly clear about this.
But I am. I'm extremely upset about it, Benjamin.
You don't remember me.
Okay. Here it is. Ever want to be someone else? Now you can. No kidding. Only two hundred dollars for fifteen minutes. Visit J.M. Inc., Mertin-Flemmer Building. etc., etc.
No, here's ugly. 'I love you, babe. It's just our life together I'm not so sure about...'
What's an audience going to tell you?
No.
How do you know about my mother?
Oh yeah.
You two don't even know how crazy you are. You want to go on your sick, little treasure hunt then go ahead, but mark me absent.
Very.
Otis!!!!
Who told you that? No. I'm twenty... Five.
Otis, good boy, come here. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
It was done. When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door. It was done.
Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it. But I guess that's what I interrupted.
Now you're talking...
You may deny the devil, Toddy, but you'll not rid yourself of him by saying the devil is dead.
Peter Redmond is an actor I admire enormously.
She told me... ...but only when she "deserves" it. Did you know he was in jail?
Yeah, and you should've seen how terrified she was that he'd find out. He beats her.
Maybe he wasn't allowed to leave! Geezus Brian!
Are you going out somewhere?
You--uh--you better relax, Senator. You'll be plumb wore out.
I hear good things about the new play.
Sorry I'm late, I got lost dropping Ben off at Kevin's.
Jack, must you go?
May I cut in, miss?
I don't know the steps.
Who put you up to this?
Make sure you're here by noon - we have tons of stuff to do... Oh yeah! I have to show you something else!
What time?
That's all you're bringing?
I'm gonna finish packing tonight... I'll bring it over tomorrow sometime.
So where's all your stuff?
There.
OK. Bye.
It's locked.
I'll have to pack a lot of clothes.
... Don't explain.
I know.
"To"... Forget about you.
Long enough.
I know.
Did Sidney tell you about it?
Ronnie. Please, baby...
It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
You've got to show her respect, you've got to show her that you're not like Joe...
It isn't the fourth dimension. To you it's the fourth dimension, maybe, to me it's simply the truth.
Yeah, what?
What?
Yeah.
I've got something to talk to you about, and the least you can do is listen. You owe me that much. I drove all the way from Pittsburgh to see you, and I'm not going until you've heard me out.
Whoah. I don't want to see pictures. I don't need to be notified of anything. Can't we just kick it old school? I could just put the baby in a basket and send it your way. You know, like Moses in the reeds.
The tough part's almost over for you. I mean, my girlfriends always tell me the first couple months are the hardest.
Yeah, but I hardly noticed it. I'm more worried about the part where I have to start wearing jeans with an elastic panel in the front.
I think pregnancy is beautiful.
Well, you're lucky it's not you.
Well, I just have the baby and give it to you, right?
What is it, pet?
He's being posted. I was terrible to him.
Don't leave it like that. Go after him. Swallow your pride.
You do, you do. You're just not saying.
You expect me to spend the rest of the war sitting at home staring at a ring? And you'll meet some French girl who can speak your own language. No thank you!
Shit, yeah. I got numbers coming out of my ears. Like, for instance, ten.
Sure. That's one of my numbers. It's how many months old my little girl is.
Yeah. Sexy, huh? And here's another: five. That's how old my other daughter is. Seven is my son's age. Two is how many times I been married and divorced. You getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454-3943 is my phone number. And with all the other numbers I gave you, I'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.
Daddy wouldn't hear that. Now the redhaired boy you see sitting there, of course you have met him, he is my oldest son and my most brilliant child. All children have great creative powers, but I don't want to rattle on about my children, they say I brag too much about them, especially about Brother. Am I boring you, Rose?
I don't like that, either, it's worse than Waski. I want to be called Fran.
Well, it's rather interesting about Brother, actually. I realized the remarkable thing he had when he was six weeks old. He looked at me and understood me, he knew exactly who I was. I know it sounds crazy but it's true. He's very remarkable, he was born for the ministry and could move millions, but he doesn't know that yet. I have to warn you about him, he can be very dangerous, there is an evil streak in him, a streak of pure sheer meanness. But at heart Brother is saintly and that is why he was born for the ministry even if he doesn't know it.
Oh, no, ma'am.
... Why... No, I don't think so...
We just about got killed. You know what happened? We just about got killed, and you want to go on?
This war's put an end to decent things. I want to close my eyes and jump and give myself for once, hold nothing back.
We shouldn't have been here, Epps. There is a war going on!
I started wondering -- if you couldn't switch back -- would it make a difference?
So you're gonna bitch up?
What...
A third layer.
I think we just hit the cosmic jackpot.
But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
You can't kill my father that easy. He'll fight forever. Like with me: hasn't talked to me in three years. But it's okay. Sometimes you have to put things behind you.
Okay.
Well I don't know.
What's wrong?
Pardon?
Like what?
What?
Promise?
He doesn't need to...
I think you had better leave
Like what? I mean, I don't remember a lot.
So how come you're putting lipstick on?
I don't know. Wherever you want.
The point sounds fine.
I'll see you burn. I'll see you dead -- GET AWAY FROM ME!!
... Why the mask?
You SCUM! You SICK FILTH!... You DID THAT to her!
Tragically, they're dead. I'm alive and I'm in poverty. You want any?
Please.
You're not saying what I think you're saying. I can't believe you're even thinking it.
Best to just tell them, man. Rip off the Band-Aid and let it bleed.
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?
No?
This has nothing to do with him.
He said...
Yeah...right, it's pointless to worry.
His name is Jeffrey Pommeroy and he used to drive a 54 Ford pickup, black with red interior. Please?
"Then they'd put you in jail."
"Before I kill you."
You are not threatening me anymore!
Don't you threaten me!
Don't you threaten me!
I am not!
All right Barton, I'll see if I can slip away-
I don't want anything. Why are you so suspicious?
No.
Nothing.
All set for what?
Ring out the old year, ring in the new. Ring-a-ding-ding.
Atlantic City?
Baxter?
Mortals, mortals everywhere. And lots of drops to drink.
How devilishly clever.
She's no vampire.
Terry's never going to give you satisfaction. Not the type.
Me too.
Oh no. Shit. I didn't know he would call you. God, you must think I'm a total nuisance.
William, that is just another facet of my delusions.
Why not?
And how do you know that?
Like who? Like MacKenzie maybe?
Why don't you help me?
What you do is take vengeance! Which is a sin against heaven!
What is.
Why don't I believe you?
Suppose you tell me what the bloody hell's going on. It's my house, you know.
Stick the soft soap. Let's be having it.
Everybody hates the messenger.
I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag. You just need to get into a car and go.
Would you leave us alone right now?
I love her too, Joe.
I'll be with you.
What if you stay this time?
But this guy is like a one-of-kind, rare butterfly, and we have to follow him back to his natural habitat...
He's insane!
We should follow him home.
Oh my God, that's HIM!
Are you sure?
Totally! Look!
It made them uncomfortable. And if they didn't sleep well I'm certain the next day they were cranky as mules. Sister where are your sheets? Do you really believe that sleeping on a bare mattress is the equivalent of sleeping in a coffin?
What makes you think this watercolorist and I would develop a romantic relationship?
Well, okay. I'll try it. I don't see the point in it, but I'll try it. Just for you. It's kind of silly, actually, me going out with an artist in New York City. However...
Wait...
You never told me how your parents met.
I talked with your father last night.
Sure.
What about the details? How they fell in love. The Circus. The War. You never told me any of that.
So what is it?
Seemed kinda sexy. Look. I read 35 pages.
Yeah. Can't believe you started such a dorky fad.
D.H. Lawrence. You ever heard of him?
Barry said its done.
That's right. So why do you take it, sweetheart?
What about?
To let people begin again. It's beautiful. You look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. And adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. And Howard just makes it go away.
It's amazing, isn't it? Such a gift Howard gave the world.
I don't know. I'm lost. I'm scared. I feel like I'm disappearing. I'm getting old and nothing makes any sense to me.
I can see that.
Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you please take care of her luggage? Thanks.
What're you doing later?
Well, you needn't. I will not be tolerated. And I will not be plotted against!
You're being terribly tolerant, aren't you?
You know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.
Commodus is heaving out every thing that belonged to our father. Except that he can't heave out his ghost.
This isn't gonna get you laid, you know.
You're around every afternoon?
You follow your desire freely enough in the night. So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go.
...uh huh...
Wait a second -- you hated Madonna. Didn't you?
V'asitem lechem pessel to-monat. And make no graven image of the Lord, or the form of any figure, or of man or woman, or beast or fowl or fish or anything that looks like anything. Because He's not like anything. Not only can't you see Him or hear Him, you can't even think about Him. I mean, what's the difference between that and Him not existing?
About an hour ago.
Yes, they are.
Where was she?
And mind, yes. What are you --
Darling -- now I've got you all upset.
That's right -- you go back to sleep. Tomorrow when you feel better things will look a whole lot different. Don't you worry about anything -- Mary's going to talk things over with your folks --
Maybe you should go, Alex.You'll meet someone wonderful.
I thought you stopped going.
She hated you --
For the flat.
Get the presents and do the lights.
My first sexual experience or the first time I had intercourse?
Was this -- "beautiful?" Before?
So what should we do?
You disapprove of me when I'm like this, don't you?
"Cora." She's - still a girl of twenty?
How's the new one coming?
... Chauncey... Chauncey...
Don't you think it's about time it became important?
I don t know. How many famous French film directors can there be?
Really? And what game did you want to play? You carry my box for me, and I fall into bed with you?
Vada? Would you like us to get you another goldfish?
NO!, He's fine. Fish are very resilient animals you know. Don't worry, I won't get another fish.
Not acknowledging Harry's comment You'll be okay little fish.
I'll ride on the bumper cars with you!
Try calling me again.
It's out of your hands.
I'm sure you must have things to do in the bathroom, Birdie dear.
Miss Coonan...
Oh, brother.
And this is my good friend and companion, Miss Birdie Coonan.
How do you do, Mr. Richards.
Dear Birdie. Won't you sit down, Miss Worthington?
If I haven't, I'll find something till you're normal.
No, we don't.
...Money problems. He's thinking about canceling the Annex.
Changing the sparks. They showed it on TV. What d'you think?
It's twenty bucks in the bank.
Let 'em eat their hearts out.
I read the article. You didn't tell me she was so beautiful.
I wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night. Anyway, I needed something to do. I was so angry with your brother. He's so... agaanisish!
It's me again.
...What a knucklehead.
We adjust to what there is to adjust to. Perhaps Paul, being young, can adjust to joy or grief immediately. I hope he can. I will take a little longer. I'll be as quick as I can.
Give us time, Harold--to adjust to your being alive.
Situation.
I don't know. This is a new disease to me.
A telegram--a phone call might have helped.
Is Charlie pressuring you to do things you don't think you should be doing?
What do you mean?
Oh.
If I wasn't such a bad woman on the page, Abbe, I'll hazard I couldn't be such a good woman in life.
-- look, you don't have to entertain me...
You're rich as Roosevelt. You're just cheap, Cosmo.
Paillarde of veal.
But you didn't come here talking 'bout Paul. You came asking about a new girl.
And he left when he found out what Sethe did? What you say casts a different light on it, I guess...I thought-
He knew Baby Suggs?
You didn't tell me that. I thought he already knew.
You?
Well, Paul D. must know who she is. Or what she is.
Just. Like. Jason.
That's coming along well!
Thank you so much!
What I mean is --
The problem is I can't hear myself sing with all this... ... music. You know what I'm saying?
Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who's gonna believe that?! We just don't live in that kind of world. Pull over!
I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
No. That's what everyone thinks. John shot a man dead in Baltimore six months before.
I do not love you, my lord.
Just how grateful I am.
He says okay, it's all right Catherine comes here.
Shouldn't we care about everybody?
Aha. Poet or philosopher?
Excuse me.
There what was?
Did you say--bus?
Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. Moore--a member of the press. Meet the Senator , Mr. Moore.
Want a ride?
he's just playing, Q...
You gotta good heart.
Cameron.
Look, I don't know how much you want to know about any of this. You have one image of your father and it would be wrong for me to go and change it. Especially this late in the game.
Can I ask you a question? Why did you come here today? If you found this deed, why didn't you just ask Eddie?
Wow. Wow, you just said it. I was expecting to dance around this for another half hour.
This was on his sales route, so he was through here all the time. Everyone in town knew him.
You're too kind.
I was thanking her. Vietnamese is such a beautiful language.
What was that?
I'll do my best.
Jesus Christ, how can you be so stupid?
... I keep telling myself okay, that's just the price, you have to do your time doing shitwork before you're allowed to get to the good stuff... but if I have to catalog one more quasar... God, I've missed you.
... We've been going after some of the big multi-nationals but without much luck; got a donation from a New York dowager... We've even been thinking about selling T-shirts.
I've examined over forty stars of roughly solar spectral type but so far nothing. Still, we've barely started...
Please. Any chance of that died the day David Drumlin was appointed head of the N.S.F. I have been in contact with a few other SETI people; we've been trying to find backing from private investors. I've even managed to scrounge a couple of hours of telescope time here and there...
How much time have we?
If we lived at any previous time in human history we wouldn't even have the option of failing -- we'd have to wonder our whole lives, unable to do anything about it. This time, right now, is unique in our history, in any civilization's history -- the moment of the acquisition of technology. The moment when contact becomes possible. We've already beaten incredible odds by being lucky enough to be alive now.
Roughly ten minutes.
Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me.
Sure.
I'm going home.
Sugar?
I wrote a poem too.
The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks.
I know.
Yes I did. Did you hear my answer?
Yes.
Yes. Did you eat?
Find out is there any chance we can get some rain tomorrow, will you...?
But you could do it, baby. We could use the bread...
Who?
I got married before, you didn't sell.
Splendid.
I've heard.
Sir, you don't have to worry about me. I'm not the sort to cry out. Shall we go in?
I was impressed with what you said in English class today.
You don't?
Every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high-impact, pressure-molded cocaine. Odorless. Undetectable by dogs. Undetectable by anyone.
They'll love that.
Fine, then we don't have a deal.
I didn't put him in a wheelchair. Reynard did. He can get around without one -- it's all in my report.
What's a toby?
I think he wants to see your rabbit foot.
No. No. No. No. I had my Child at Cedars and Sinai. And that ain't no county hospital. You have to have cash or check before you come in the door.
I thought you weren't old fashioned.
Junior's wife kept her afterbirth' in the refrigerator. That's why I do not eat over there now.
I take it she read well.
How nice.
Yes, of course, I'm so sorry. Stupid of me. Hana gets up, upset to have hurt him.
I'm here, aren't I?
You know what the difference is between us, Violet?
No.
... Me neither.
Of course. I am married still.
Bed wetter!
Pacifist!
Let's go to the church, they're playing bingo tonight.
Sorry.
Yes. And I don't want anybody to steal it from me.
A new invention?
He can stay home. Please, Dad, won't you?
Wouldn't it be a little embarrassing ... all of us there ... your other and me and your stepfather?
This is my wedding.
Where are you going?
Wait a minute. When is it going to be? I'm leaving town tonight.
If you think it'll be all right.
Take mine instead -- here -- smash mine first!
Alan's very sick. He has to go to New Mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.
Apparently it didn't help. You know about Peter, of course.
Peter Redmond. They found out why he can't remember his lines. There's something living in his brain. A parasite he picked up in Borneo, doing the movie.
What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
Can I join you?
She showed me a drawing.
No. She asked about the trademark.
She was just asking about you - Whether it was nice to work for you or not.
One believes - it's like any other religion...
What the fuck are you doing?
You will not live to see the morning.
I'm sorry, Mr. Baxter.
I'm your landlady
My God!
Yes. I'm the only one. I have to enter Malkovich and destroy him from the inside. If not me, who?
Your sister wants to ask you something.
Sshhh! He's in there.
But there wasn't any...
We already did.
We needed to verify some bond certificates for Claremont. She pushes stuff through the system for us... helps us track down perps for a kick back. It's all legal. INT. MUSTANG CONVERTIBLE -- DAY
Her car was in the shop.
Alright, well, alright: geopolitically...
You know what? This is good. This is terrific, and I'll tell you why: it's cost effective. This is....
How can I act naturally, when you've trying to break my arm?
Good!
I don't need one 'cause I know what's really going on here. I have to finish this letter or I'll go nuts. This can't be right -- con- science.
I still don't feel safe leaving Spencer with someone. How do you spell it again?
I run down the numbers. Nothing is very negotiable. Small loads? We pay three thousand a ki. We pay your fuel costs up front plus ten percent. The next ten percent on U.S. landfall.
-- I thought we had secure frequency. Aww girl, tell me this mafucka ain't goin' off right now.
-- It's your IFB, somebody else has got an earpiece, you're picking up their signal --
No, but that definitely sounds like shots and I don't where it's comin' from --
Are you anywhere near the penthouse?
And we'll sell the house.
I can't marry you! I can't ever marry you!
Listen, Bren-duhhh, I think you're the one overstepping boundaries. You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this and get huge and push a baby out of your vag for someone else. Besides, who cares if he's married? I can have friends who are married.
It doesn't work that way, kiddo. You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.
You don't know anything about me!
I know enough.
We don't even have a dog!
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva. I've made a lot of sacrifices for you, Juno. And in a couple years you're going to move out -- and I'm getting Weimaraners.
Wow, dream big!
Oh, go fly a kite.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you know, no, no, no, I mean, I think it's really important for us to explore new relationships and stuff like that.
Right. Geez, I feel like there's a great weight off my back. M'mmm.
God.
Oh-
Now, look, all the books on death and dying are yours and all the poetry books are mine.
So, I don't really get it -- are you saying that things were better back then even though there was stuff like this?
Hey, can I borrow this?
Jesus, I'd go nuts if I had to work in an office all day.
Yeah, but still...
Today I can refuse you nothing.
I promise I'll take good care of it.
Oh, no place as wonderful as this. Agnes... have you ever thought of leaving the convent for something else?
Where did you go?
It's like hiding from my mother when I was a little girl.
Oh, it's even more wonderful then.
What things?
I get headaches. Mommy did too... oh, but she wasn't stupid. She knew things that nobody else knew.
You have trouble sleeping?
No. There is nothing else. Just being here at night helps me sleep.
How did she know that?
She knew what was going to happen to me. That's why she hid me away.
I understand that you have recently been given the rank of knight.
Well, why don't they try the police-- get some blood hounds--or Indian guides--
Okay. For the dollar, I give you McGann and Bill and Carl. I got Paine. Hello... Oh, yes.
When Foley died, why didn't I clear out? How many times, did you hear me say I was fed up on politics and--? But no --I let 'em talk me into staying. Secretary to a leader of little squirts. Why? Because I need the job and a new suit of clothes.
You know where it came from. It's not like it's anybody's life savings. It wouldn't even be missed.
Toss you for it.
Did God make you the sacker of peaceful cities? The executioner of the king's nephew, my husband's own cousin?
And you'd never been there before?
So when you sleepwalk, can you remember afterward? Like, do you dream?
My dad said never wake a sleepwalker... because they could drop dead.
Eve would ask Abbott to give her Costello.
With gestures, of course.
Yes.
It's beautiful!
Looks like at the end of the day we finally find out who's better than who, don't we, Epps? Like I said; I expected more from you.
Mr. Thatcher, isn't everything I've been saying in the Enquirer about the traction trust absolutely true?
Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
Because we're bitches! Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails. Please!
Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that?!
No way.
Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what "bitch" means, don't you?
Thank you.
John, we have nothing to talk about.
I took one of those home pregnancy tests, but I don't want to tell him. I'm RH negative. My blood type is negative... If he's RH positive, I'll have to terminate.
Good cop bad cop?
That is the most unprofessional --
Why?
Excuse me?
I'm happy enough.
It's hardly the same --
Well, in connection with my job, sometimes I have to go undercover as it were --
Well, maybe I --
Well, then what are you doing here?
You're talking like a drunk.
I really don't know.
What for?
Please--
I'll get ready, Herb. I didn't expect you this soon. Please--won't everybody be nice to everybody else while I'm gone?
Doing what?
Or was. We haven't done anything wrong, you know.
You shame yourself.
Where?
You okay ?
You're totally insane.
You heard me.
I was inside once. I punched a cop at a demo.
Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.
Can I talk to you a minute?
Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
Who the hell do you think you are coming into my house and saying those things to me. My brother is dead, have some respect.
What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
Yeah.
I'd be more comfortable if you hadn't slept with Josh. And George would be more comfortable if he weren't dying.
I'm going to bed.
I'm plenty happy!
Mister McMurphy. Patients aren't allowed in here.
No.
Hi, Jeff. Nice to meet you.
He says we got to be at the radio station at seven a.m. Can you handle that?
Great. Hi. I'm Erica.
Yes?
Yes. I have a long ride ahead of me... Goodbye.
Goodbye.
Because as far as I'm concerned, he's a no good fink. Two weeks ago I wrote him a letter -- never even answered me.
All I wanted him to do was let Mickey out for Christmas.
My husband. He's in Havana -- in jail.
Mickey? He wouldn't do nothing like that. He's a jockey. They caught him doping a horse.
'Twas the night before Christmas And all through the house Not a creature was stirring -- Nothing -- No action -- Dullsville! You married?
So you have your small victory, now what?
No matter what you think, you did come up with something unique. Open it.
A gift.
This--this is a luau that sells packing material!
Better person than I.
Because I bought the windshield last week. I'm a hubcap away from owning more of Bambi than you do.
Rob, take the money, okay? It's no big deal.
Oh--yikes!
To put us back together again when we fall.
What! But--I wasn't even going to go to college--
Beautiful. Sad. She died!
Yeah, me too. Every day for the last ten years.
She fucked herself up day after day and then, one day, she fell asleep with a burning cigarette. I came home from work and she was gone.
Never knew my father. I grew up with my mother. Actually, I grew up around my mother. She was great though. I mean, the way she was with her friends... She was this woman who had so much life in her, she had to find ways to kill some of it just to be like the rest of us. She died young.
I'm sorry.
Yes - If I can't convince Sophie, I'll never be able to see Tatiana....
I think it s good to be a little unsure about who you are. It s very human.
Great. I'll see you soon.
Honey. What were you doing with that?
I hate this city.
Oh?
I really think that business...matters should be discussed between you t...
It didn't discourage you, though.
It's only a joke, Mummy. I'm fifteen. I'm still at school. I want to be a nun when I grow up.
I won't have this vulgar talk in my house.
I've been dreaming about this.
Oh, somebody else sitting there?
Gabriel! You said talk to him. That's all you ever said...
Oh! Oh, it's beautiful, D. B. Well I don't quite know what to say . . .
Bully for you.
Okay.
Are you calling me a liar? I'm telling you I'm broke. I don't even have insurance on my goddamned car.
Jesus God, Auggie. There's money in here.
What's this?
And you're giving it to me?
Is this a bad time?
He'll tell me when he gets home.
Instead of busting my chops you should do something about that girl. Fire her. Or something.
No.
Prick.
It's almost nine, I've been so worried! What did you see in there?
I'm telling you what is there. You're just not hearing. The impulses somehow aren't getting from you ears to your brainpan. There's something down there. Something not... us.
Not us. Not human. Get it? Something non- human, but intelligent...
A non-terrestrial intelligence.
Oh really - you must remember me from when I was a regular customer.
No - I've been abroad for a long time...
Brad, you are drunk.
What's wrong?
I don't think so, Brad. We've just had word that the President is out of danger. It seems I didn't kill him after all.
Yeh, that's bull. I'm going for serene, they say some actually get there.
Panes?
Would you sign it for me. I'm sure this is inappropriate.
Trust him.
Answer the question, please.
And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
Oh, yeah.
That was really great.
I think you want to go to the west wing. Through there.
I thought cherry-vanilla was your favourite.
It's Martha, Mama. There you go.
It's your favourite...
Hello, Mama ... brought you something.
Did you have a good week Mama. Are they treating you all right?
I used to be an actress.
I'm the emancipated type. Real emancipated.
I'm a college girl. Two days a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays, I go to college.
I'm not.
Que va hacer?
It's too late...She's a woman grown now...
Oh, Rick!
I am on the board of my son's school. I had a fundraiser for A.L.V. in my front yard. I have a right to know if my husband is a legitimate businessman.
What?
Becky?
Did you talk to him?
Okay. Good. Goodbye.
That's not what I mean. I'm going back over there tomorrow and talk to him. I am.
You told a lie and got on a plane.
I couldn't do it. How did I get here?
These appointments were not my idea, remember.
It's a strange hobby. Curious, I mean.
I imagine so.
What are you talking about?
I hate Sadie.
Don't wake up Vada.
Jesus, Fergus, you're a walking cliche. You know we won't leave her out of this. But I'm glad to see you care.
We've got some plans here. And we'll need a Mister Nobody to execute them.
You're never out, Fergus.
I know all about that. But I don't know how much to tell them.
I don't know what's going on. I--
Fetch what home?...The leavin's of Comanche bucks -- sold time an' again to the highest bidder?...With savage brats of her own, most like?...
No. She wanted me to know the truth. Now that I do...I think she's at peace.
A couple of months.
I don't think you should infer Daddy was wrong in front of him...
I hope I didn't hear that.
You know, I've got to do some shopping afterwards. Do you want to go?
Yeah, and I get a sprained fuckin' elbow.
Why have you put a toilet and a bed in your garage?
Yes, I called him right away. He says it's nothing to worry about.
Oh, I'll teach you how to surf even if you don't get the gig.
Oh, she's got a cold. She's in bed. Caught it coming home from school. They gave her a flower for a prize and she didn't want to crush it so she didn't button up her coat.
Just a cold. The doctor says it's nothing serious.
Oh!
There's no reason why you should. This has been planned from your birth. You fit all the criteria that we know of. Never baptized, born of incest, devoid of faith...
Why won't you come with me? What are you so scared of?
Look, Will if you're not in love with me, you can say that.
Why not?
What story, Mr. Rogers?
I'm just trying to understand what's going on.
I think I understand, Mr. Rogers, but I wonder if -
Charlie, he said, unless you withdrew your name -
You can't blackmail me, Rogers, you can't -
That I am not Rheya. That Rheya died. Killed herself. I'm different.
You do anything you want to do. The people of this state can decide which one of us to trust. If you want to know, they've already decided. The election Tuesday'll be only -
Sartorius.
I'm going to scream!
Ouch!
No, he wasn't. He just lowered himself into a bar stool and said... 'Oo I do feel bad. I 'ad three pints of lager and six onion bajees!'
Great.
Isn't it illegal to drink and drive?
Working? What do you mean, working? I'm walking.
You're pretty drunk.
Maybe you shouldn't stand in the road like that. You're pretty drunk.
Okay. That is great. But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here.
Okay. Okay. Hold that thought just for a second. They only call me when it's an emergency. Just hold that thought. Can you call back?
Yeah.
Why not?
You don't like his friends.
Let me go home.
I never thought you did.
We always knew you'd come to us, Louis.
That's a beauty!
You followed me. I can't believe it!
Oh!
You know, he's been wanting a mitt.
Thanks, thanks.
I just have time to get the, uh-
Football!
Is this what it's like to love somebody?
I know already. We don't have to pretend now.
You don't need to do that.
Are you?
Funny Jimmy. You're so clean and you--this is silly.
You've never said that before.
That thing about I was the most, you know, beautiful person you had ever known. What was that?
When I picked you up from the train station...what you said.
Nothing is going on with us, is it?
It sounded like a pick-up line.
So, does "this guy" have a tip for an honest lawyer?
Let's go, Vaughan. Frank, we'll be back in a little while. I'll bring you back somethin'. You're food's in the oven warmin' over.
I'm still poor.
Don't. We know what happened. Don't go on.
I did not go to high school.
And what can you tell us about this...
Yeah it's the biggest disappointment!
To come?
Yeah. Fifteen minutes to a half an hour. Hard and deep.
Yeah I get bored.
I was wrong to free him, but so are you -- for taking all his treasures -- his quills and his ink --
Gus?
Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative.
How recently?
You know what I'm talking about.
Honey, please...
It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.
What's he doing here?
So Juno, how did your maneuver go last night?
Which maneuver, sir? The one in which I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to another, or the one in which I cleared a sixty-four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?
Juno? Did you happen to barf in my urn? Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater? I found some weird blue shit, I mean stuff, gunk, in there this morning.
Thinking like that is only gonna drive you nuts You were a great star and you had a good run. That oughta be enough.
Sure, but I can't get it till after school tomorrow.
I won t comment on the time but you ll understand if I don t tell you to sit down. Now, spare me the apology and get to the point, will you, Mr Lombard.
What answer were you--
Here's what you asked for. Brill's note said it was everything you'd need to, shall we say, coax DePinto--
Do you like fish?
DePinto?
That sounds like horseshit.
He makes films for Mr. Eddy.
He works for Mr. Eddy.
No, honey... It was part of the deal.
I used to.
Here, you put your hand under the water and I'll pump for you.
When did she die?
Maybe Wade should take a look at it. Your pipes'll freeze. Wade, would you do that?
William Starks. Thanks.
But, Madam. cannot do that.
Let us cancel the engagement.
It will pass -- it will pass -- come.
I can't dance tonight --
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Always the performance -- every day the performance -- time for the performance. I think, Suzette, I have never been so tired in my life. Veronal didn't even help me to sleep.
...A mindless barbarian. Not a king like you, M'lord.
He waits. For you. He says he will attack no more towns -- if you are man enough to come fight him.
No. I have it to ease the suffering of the children of this war.
Humbly, M'lord.
Forgive me, Sire. I thought that generosity might demonstrate your greatness to those you mean to rule.
But she's --
I am, sir.
The--the officers.
Follow orders. Do whatever they say.
Who?
Of course not. We're just not quick to run and boast. In case something went wrong.
Unlikely.
Oh. Okay.
I know, Louise, but we're running for our lives! Don't you think you could make an exception just this once?! I mean, look at the map. The only thing between Oklahoma and Mexico is Texas!
This is so weird. It's happening, but it's not. It's like a TV show, and we're part of it.
Well, okay. Well, listen, I'm gonna get a cigarette, okay?
You do.
Two, three thousand a ki. Two thousand ki's, your end is 6,000,000. Complex transshipments or dealing with containers, these have front- loaded costs we pickup. For this kind of weight, the balance of 80 is when our buyer picks up the load. Transactions are offshore. Dollars or euros. Secure internet transfers. We have lists of Cayman and Isle of Man banks infiltrated by IRS, to be avoided... No transactions of cash or other banking instruments take place on U.S. soil... That's the deal.
Yes... that's what I pray for...!
Right now.
She's doing like those Iranians. I divorce thee. I divorce thee. I divorce thee'
Is it?
So at the intermission I can listen to the ball game. Do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?
I'm seeing your play tonight, remember?
Way out...
I was inspired by the hero, how he stuck his neck out for others, how he took a chance...
I don t know how you did it, hoss, but you pulled it off.
You know champagne makes me do crazy things.
You son of a bitch. She's been here.
You want her to visit you? Good! Let her stay up all night crying and writing letters to the parole board.
What's it mean?
Know your enemy.... 'Cause it's a basic text of Western culture. I want to read it in the original. Okay?
You wouldn't have any color film, would ya?
...Yeah, sure.
She wasn't gonna get up. I was just gonna be out for a little while.
They told me.
Hi, Sam.
It's just for a little while, Sam. The baby-sitter wasn't there.
Oh...
It's not opinion.
Yes. Not like Enzo.
I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy.
Where are you staying?
... I'm pregnant, Bonita!
Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck. They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck.
No.
My parents flew back from Israel... Told him they would get him killed unless he flew back to Brazil immediately and agreed to a divorce. He flew back to Brazil... And his drowning was arranged...
Let go!
I'm perfectly calm, I'm a normal human being. I'm going for a walk in the park.
You told me I'm safe? I'm going for a walk in the park.
And then what? I'll never be safe. I'll have to leave the country! You can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! And you knew that all the goddamn time!
Now look what you've done.
No.
That was read at my parents' wedding.
Why?
...they say you're alright.
I'm disgusting.
This is it, then.
I'm not Rheya. You've always known that.
You're a celebrity, John. People are going to want to please you... or use you... or both.
No, I can't have dinner with you.
Are you serious.
I was doing an insurance investigation in Palermo. I work for an insurance company. So, I decided to take a few days off. I don't know this island at all. It really is gorgeous.
... Okay. I'll try.
Embezzling ? I'm not embezzling !
Well then, when you get older you can do something about it.
But all ends well.
Right. And when was the last time you spoke to her?
And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part? Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me? I'm an actress! It's about our marriage for fuck's sake. Everybody knows that...
About me!
What are you saying?
I don't look my age, Joe.
I figured it was. Where are you?
Hello.
I don't know -- I've got to.
Call me at work. We can arrange to meet properly. I don't want this to be the last conversation we have. I know what you're like.
Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
I know.
No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
My real father? Well, he was a flashback.
Why don't you tell us what the fuck is going on ?
And the shape of it all. It was sort of...shapeless.
Confession. I'm a complete softie. I've been conscience-stricken and worried sick ever since that leopard got away --
You're positive of that, aren't you?
....shame on you, truly...
Do you think that's funny?
Romeo. What's here? Poison. Drunk all, and left no friendly drop to help me after. I will kiss thy lips. Happily some poison yet doth hang on them. Thy lips are warm.
Hi. I'm inquiring ...well, I heard a sound last night that sounded like a car crash and I want to know if there was an accident on Mulholland Drive.
You told me you wanted to meet him. Well,here he is.
Catherine!
Laz. I'm gonna put my trust in you. I'm gonna do it knowin' all too well I can get hurt like this. And I have been hurt. Just like you. Woman like me, I got a lot of livin' to do. But my days are precious to me. They all I got left. Don't want no more fuss. I want love in my life. You understanding me, Laz?
Laz... you don't need to explain yourself to me...
More cough syrup?
What do you need?
I don't want to confuse him, Stephen.
Not that I can see.
The soul. The spirit. Whatever you want to call it.
I don't believe it, Jean they're picking straws.
Frank!
Ted, I just heard...
You need to believe in something besides yourself.
Don't talk like that to him!
Paulie!
It's not your house --
...Are you going to say anything to him?
Easy, hon, I was just looking for fun details --
I'm so sorry.
Oh, well, why didn't you say so? And oh, I don't know if you're interested in this detail, but I was just about to tell you that I love him. I love him, and I don't care what you think. I love him for the guy he wants to be, and I love him for the guy he almost is. I love him.
Nothing really worthwhile.
Well, it was good to see you, Daniel, but I have to be going.
It was a long time ago, Daniel. We were young, different people, heading in different directions. That's all.
Well, time will tell, won't it?
Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
You know what, Mr. Potter? I completely forgot your birthday this year. And seeing as how you've been so good to me, I think that is a terrible oversight. So what I been doing over the last few days is I've been putting together a present for you.
He knows his alphabet.
Oh, now don't get all jealous, Ed. I got a little something for you, too.
Hey, Ros, where are they?
Morning!
Without someone to teach you, it's tough.
The bathroom. Look at how clean it is. The one in our cabin is clean... but this is clean!
What do I do?
It's okay - I'll help. Please.
So I follow the wires?
That's the end of the line.
From A to Z. All you have to do now is figure out what they mean put together in words.
Like who?
Stay for awhile. Rest. I'll make coffee and breakfast.
Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?
I don't know. I woke up a little dizzy. I didn't sleep well. I think I need to lay down.
Madge?
Madge. Please. Something's happened. I've met someone. I've fallen in love in a way I've never thought could happen my entire life. It's our last day together. I feel like I'm going to die when he leaves. Please. Help me.
No, no. I just didn't sleep well. I'm not used to sleeping alone. And this heat. Would you mind?
Silk -- think of that -- silk -- they are, too.
I can hear it in your voice.
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch.
I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County --
What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you?
Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother?
Sure.
She's my sister and my daughter!
Who are you?
Hollis came and took... care of me... after she was born... he said... he took care of her... I couldn't see her... I wanted to but I couldn't... I just want to see her once in a while... take care of her... that's all... but I don't want her to know... I don't want her to know...
...he had a breakdown... the dam broke... my mother died... he became a little boy... I was fifteen... he'd ask me what to eat for breakfast, what clothes to wear!... It happened... then I ran away...
Trial? What trial??
And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
... movie. That's your problem. You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie. Read it to me.
They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was...
It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
"Dear Sleepless and Son..."
You're a basket case.
Wouldn't you? You're laughing! I Was sure you never laughed.
Eddie... go home. Get some sleep.
I'm exaggerating.
I'm about to go into the shower, I won't be able to hear you...
Eddie...
Yes. The Shubert.
Yes. I do.
That's right.
I never knew a more idealistic man than you.
Billy said that?
Danny that's a real bonehead thing to say!
After they commissioned it, no one could ever agree on where to put it. The Methodists wanted it in front of the Methodist Church, the Presbyterians wanted it in front of the Presbyterian Church, the city council wanted it in the lobby of City Hall. Everyone finally got tired of the fighting. So they stuck it down here.
I think that's great, Milo. I do.
Why don't you ask him.
I should quit this job. I'm going to get so fat working here... nobody will ever take me out.
What'd it say?
I hope so, Mr. Richards. Good night...
You said forty-seven minutes. You'll never make it.
He left a beautiful gift in her place. A baby boy. To cherish and love as our very own. Your brother
She was mother to me as well. But ours is the job of the living. It's up to us now to hold this family together. We must think of Father and be strong for him. I cannot do that alone.
It's not ours to decide. All that live must die. It's God's will.
Who's that?
Why not? Just once. A trial run. What harm could it do?
She thinks I can bring Edward back.
She adores you.
He hates me.
...I just hope...
Every time I tell you that I love you, you flinch. But that's your problem.
Mickey, come on, we got a show to do!
If I flinch when you say you love me, it's both our problems. My confusion becomes your confusion. Students confuse teachers, patients confuse psychiatrists, lovers with confused hearts confuse lovers with clear hearts....
Yes.
She stole some money.
You have to come to my dad's lobster pound and see one, then.
Forty thousand dollars.
Stacy. What does it matter? He's a stereo salesman. You want to marry him? You want to have kids with him? You want this guy to come home, fifty years old, and he's still got that little Pacific Stereo badge on? Come on.
I shall call him Diello.
Horny bastard.
You do see me standing here, right?
You weren't gonna say goodbye?
I've got a gift just like you do. My gift is I just know what people mean, even if they can't say it. It helps when you're trying to communicate with fighter pilots. Like what you just said was "I'm embarrassed, I feel I've done something wrong, that I've failed, and I don't think I can live up to the expectations of a wonderful interesting, intelligent woman like yourself." That about it?
How. Did you. Know that?
Three o'clock.
You said things would be fine, and they're not.
Y-you used to-- Oh, no! Yeah, I care. You used to be so ambitious and... God, you really liked it?!
Gosh, you really went through a crisis, you know that? H-how did you get over it? I mean, when I ran into you, you seemed, you seemed just perfectly fine. Well, you seem fine now.
You never called me back. I left messages.
Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
There's two things I can't stand, Mr. Masry. Being ignored, and being lied to. You did both.
He's dead.
It's crossed my mind from time to time.
When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again.
That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother.
He wouldn't blow up. He'd just get all mangled or twisted.
Well a lot of things cross my mind. I've always been a fast thinker, Ev. I can play out the movie of our entire lives in under a second. Boom -- we fall in love -- get married -- two kids, your keen analytical insight matched to my generous nature -- kids grow old as do we, relatively stable relationships, matching burial plots, the whole bit. It took a lot longer to spit out than to imagine.
They left it in the jungle.
NY Times, Washington Post, War, War, War. Times got the girlscout page twelve, Post in Section Two.... Horses in Mid-Stream...?
Well, we paid for it, we got the guys on a retainer.
I've come to a decision.
... Mr. President, how good to see you.
Why is he doing this?
I'm not convinced of that, Mr. President, but your visit has raised my spirits...
Sport never treated me bad, honest. Never beat me up once.
What should I do? Call the cops?
God. I know where they should have a commune for you. They should have a commune for you at Bellevue.
How?
You're not much with girls, are you?
Well -- he got us, didn't he? She stands and goes quickly to pour a drink. A forced laugh
My name ain't Niki. It's Pattica, like in Attica.
Who's that?
I's thinkin' about singing in the choir.
But... Momma... just tell me... not gonna be mad... we can just talk about it... Be eye to eye on this... You don't even got to say you're sorry... Just say how you knew...
Mm-hm. I don't know if I got a good voice or not but... practice is only on Mondays and Wednesdays, so...
What are you doing?
All right, just don't make any noise.
Not when they fly.
Thank you Janey.
Maybe we can just watch some TV.
I don't know.
Do you have a scarf?
...say it, Jimmy...
I'm asking you. I'm asking you if you know why Clauida will not speak to you....please, Jimmy....tell me.
Well! You don't say!
Give it to him -- so we can concentrate.
I loved it...he...
0h, God . . . I'm so sorry!
I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Samuel. I want to go home.
Better than you.
You know what?
I understand. I saw the dress. I...I'm sorry. Are you all right?
Please don't. Don't, Rick. I can understand how you feel.
I didn't count the days.
I'll get it, Jabez.
How is she alright looking the way she does?
Ah, c'mon...
How's the spying tonight, guys?
I scanned it at Arecibo; negative results, always.
Buddy, that was my place.
Look, Rob. If great sex was as important as you think it is, and if I was having great sex with him, then we wouldn't be lying here now. And that is my last word on the subject, okay?
... Like Mexico. Or Jamaica. Or New York, even.
I'll pay for you. Even though you owe me money. We have to do something with the money I earn. I need to. I deserve it. You can just think of it as winning the lottery.
Money does not matter. I do not care how much you earn. I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.
Dear heart, you have to help me. I'm raising our kids practically by myself, while you're running all over the world. You don't know how many times the girls ask me when is daddy coming home?
Will they? Are you sure? Are you sure or are you blind?
What do we have, Malcolm. A broken- down jalopy and the clothes on our backs. We don't even own our own home. What about our children? What about me? You don't even own life insurance.
A long time ago. You've repaid them many times over. Ask them why they have new cars and houses full of new furniture.
Do you know what Bembry is doing? You're so blind, everyone can see this but you!!!
No, what's the matter with you? Wake up! Are you so dedicated that you have blinded yourself? Are you so committed you cannot face the truth? Bembry is the editor of the newspaper you established. Ask him why your name hasn't been in "Muhammad Speaks" in over a year? Ask him why you rate front page in every paper in the country, but not a single sentence in your own.
Oh, uh-huh.
No. Why?
Graham is an unusual name.
Oh.
Television?
The nanobot... it's not here...
I'm a woman, Martie... We wash and mend your dirty clothes all our lives...When you're little we even wash you....How a man can ever make out to get bashful in front of a woman I'll never know...
Daniel, I didn't hear you come down...
What you gettin' red-in-the-face for?...I have brothers, haven't I?
Run downstairs and give your dad a hug.
Good. 'Cause I...um...I really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...
What kind of personal project?
I bet Dolores told Charlie.
Ho, ho, ho, yourself! I wouldn't laugh if I were you. You may not suspect it, but I'm still attractive - to some.
I thought that...umm...maybe you'd be curious about how I turned out.
I guess what I mean is, my mother married my dad after you...and then I was born, so I thought that...maybe you got divorced because of me.
More than anything in the world.
Umm...didn't you ever wonder about me?
Well...
I tell you what. Why don't I read with her?
Anything to help you out, Max.
Well, if she can act, she might not be bad. She looks like she might burn down a plantation...
When's the audition?
Not at all. And you could do me a big favor, if you would-
I don't know what that means.
What? How could he have? When?
Ask him.
I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire I love that, I believe that. Who is K?
Please don't creep around this house.
I don't care if you do or... I want to see Mary... before she gets in any deeper...
Good night, Billy.
You're leaving.
Just like we look forward to this.
They can look forward to that.
Spitz. We spoke on the telephone. My husband... My daughter, Deborah, whose house this is. My son-in-law, Carlos... The gentleman is a business partner of his.
What if I pushed to twenty-one...?
Maybe I'm only one.
We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
I will. I will. We still have another day.
What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
What are you saying?
We're not going to get a ride tonight.
No one's traveling in this weather.
Not even a hunch. Just hope.
She ever pull down her shades?
Bill-
Show me a human and I might have!
Bill...
Thank you so much.
I'm supposed to understand this.
I'm a junk yard.
Bill!
Possibly.
A week. We were waiting for the right time to--
Oh, you're right, I know. It's... well, I was just -
Nothin'.
What's with you two?
Then, Lord Dunois, show me the way to the other side of the river...
For what?
Because if they don't, I'll raise such a war-cry against them that they will remember us forever!
You may have been with your counsel, but I've been with mine, and I'm telling you, God's counsel is wiser than yours, and he's telling me to speak to the English -- now!
I'm saying they came into my yard.
I'm saying they came into my yard.
Those white things have taken all I had or dreamed. I'm saying ain't no bad luck in this world 'cept for white folks..They just don't know when to stop.
No, Stamp. I ain't.
Not like He punished me.
Oh, now I'm a bad housekeeper!
It is, It is! Hie hence, be gone, away. O, now be gone. More light and light it grows.
Well, I got in everywhere I applied, but Cornell is my first choice.
Hello, Mr. M.
Hey, what's the matter?
It's obviously based on Elliot and me.
Oh, not here. There are too many people around.
No, not "Oh, so loosely"! Real specifically! Is that how you see us?
Oh, so loosely.
Sonofabitch!
But I don't need an uncle, Sidney.
She's not Irena's child -- there's nothing of Irena in her. She's my child.
You ol' fucker!
Wait a minute...
I'm not a jealous woman, Oliver.
I wonder if you don't resent that in her?
I read the probation report. It's not good. I think you're going... going to prison, Mister... Bernie. I know that scares you but..
Well, tell me. Should I be worried?
I want one with you.
Why not?
Why do you say that? Is there something wrong?
But what do, what do you-- what's that mean? W-w-we've been, we've been married for four years. How settled can things get?
Look. Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know. All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.
I don't know.
Me. My home number is on this card.
His home number.
They haven't done the standard scratch test. Where they make small injections into the skin?
No. I asked. They said it's not covered under my plan. And it's not necessary anyway.
Have they done skin testing for allergies?
No.
No. Actually, I think that's their technical name.
Once the tests come back, is there someone I can reach in your office for the results?
It's amazing these things weren't done.
Fucking H.M.O. bastard piece of shit... I'm sorry... forgive me.
Don't. It was a shitty job anyway. I overreacted.
What's going on?
What's your fucking problem?
Do what?
You have to believe in something. What do they believe in -- the Whatjamacillit church?
Sure.
He's my favorite.
It's a Calder.
I know.
Ah...
They're the keys to your grandad's flat. Happy anniversary, baby.
Okay. You didn't like the party, huh?
Does Oomie really like this show?
Isn't it weird? It's her favorite.
I dunno. John Ellis always puts on all this sick stuff that I have to fast-forward past to get to the good stuff. There's supposed to be a Don Knotts movie on here someplace.
Wait... I just want to see what's on this tape.
Hey - why do you have this?
-- really incredible --
What?
Eventually. Does it have to be right now?
An accident.
And as you do, the bottle will slip from your hands. -- and shatter against the hardwood floor.
Don t do that...
STOP IT! I want to read them! If you don't want to, then just leave. But don't you push me around like I'm some mule you paid for -- I already GOT A HUSBAND!
Is there what? I've told you there's nothing wrong... except that I'm in a hurry and you're taking up my time...
NO! GOD, NO...
Mmmmfffstttubll abbittmm.
Why are they ganging up against me?
What do they want from me? What have I done that's so wrong? They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... Even you probably have things.
I can't sleep.
They said if I didn't get help, they wouldn't deal with me any more. What do you think about that?
It's the kids, you know, not Jeremy. He had nothing to do with this -- except pay, of course. He's always willing to pay. He's extremely generous. I'm so humiliated that my own children would threaten me.
Thanks. And isn't there something we can do about supper -- or making the beds?
But you eat, don't you?
Where do you keep the can opener?
Open that door, you'll see. Your brother's there... Conrad. He's there. It's your birthday party...
It is. It's what you hired us for. Nobody touched your money. Nobody stole anything. They're waiting on the other side of that door with champagne... all your friends... it's a celebration...
Maybe...maybe ... maybe.
We'll see. And thank your father in the morning. A man always needs to be thanked.
Just sit here for a moment. You seem very upset.
Samuel is going to hire a new bodyguard. It may take a few days, but you're going back.
Good news. You're going back to school.
When?
You should be sleeping, baby.
I'm trying, mom.
Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go?
But accidents can happen.
Cole, that's very wrong. Grandma's gone. You know that.
Yeah, once I cut them off. Why?
Don't mention it.
Those people down there are Shi'ites. You've got Shi'ites in the south of Iraq and Khurds in the North. Neither of them've got much love for Saddam. Probably figured once the war started there might be an uprising, so he sent his soldiers out to slap them around some.
Is there anything you do know?
Why did she have to die?
Don't explain. Fuck off. Goodbye.
What's going on? I'm going on my second job this month, and now I'm going on unemployment.
I would never think that about you... ever... Got it?
Oh, no... you.
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
You threw him out?
...So he says to me, "you'll never find another man like me"...I said, "please, men like you have one hand on their dicks and the other hand on their mother's leg... I said, there's the door - take a trip.
Will it hurt?
What do they want?
From whom?
What is it?
Did you come here to tell me how to run my business?
No. I was wondering if you'd like to take a trip down south with us. Maybe see where you grew up--
Nobody is illegal in my cafe! They've got green cards, they've got relatives who were born here--if they only had a little common sense I'd be very happy.
If you spent a little more time training them--
You want to see Mexicans, open your eyes and look around you. We're up to our ears in them.
Mami, how old were you when my father--
Why would I want to go there?
Oh, come on--you must be curious how it's changed. Amado is into this big Tejano roots thing and I've never been further than Ciudad Leon--
He was killed.
Right. When he was killed.
I told him we might not need it, if you can talk your parents into giving you your share of the property.
We could borrow on that land and put the money to work.
Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
Yes.
Would you mind walking ahead of me to the sun porch. I feel funny about coming into a dark house.
Maybe not. I was a different person then. Does everybody you meet spill their problems on you like this?
I want you to come in till I get the lights on.
I better go check on my father. Thanks for the pizza. I owe you one. Maybe when he gets better, you know, when we're done with all this.
My mom. Would be the problem.
What do you drink? Bourbon?
Sure.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I told you but you wouldn't listen. You never listened to me.
What?
Seventh, files section. What should I do?
Max, I'm scared. Are you sure?
Not all of it?
Do you think I'm grudging it?
We can still use my butter money.
Hey, Pony, this is my friend Bee-Bee.
Yes, thank you, sir.
I will, sir.
Good morning.
Nothing.
You don't forget anything, do you?
Hello... hello. How are you this morning?
She was in the theater? When? Where?
Al least a contingency for wardrobe. Any woman can go up a dress size.
There isn't one.
Well, we have to help her!
Why don't you just go back to your pickin', Homer? I can take care of it myself!
That's not true; we had dinner together just last night.
Happy ! What are you thinkin'? How am I supposed to take care of a baby! I can't have a baby.
You think Daddy's gonna let me go anywhere? I ain't going nowhere .
Too many times.
Shut the fuck up.
Well, how about a walk, Charlie Bell..
How soon?...
Well, he has been pushing me to meet his father, but I've been putting it off.
Come on, I doubt the answer's that simple.
There's something else I want from you.
What are you doin' up again, Frank? You need to get a little sleep.
No, honey, we don't. I'll make some coffee and start cleanin' up this mess. Karl, you want some coffee, huh?
Oh. I guess I always liked Rusty better. Could you give me a ride to school?
I'm fine, honey. Let's just try and forget about tonight.
After that I'll introduce you to my favorite monkey, Elijah. He's got an ulcer, due to a suppressed childhood trauma. But we're getting to the bottom of it. Psychotherapy.
Ah.
Did you know that Eskimos have not one, but fifty words for snow. It's because they have so much of it.
How come I'm still in black and white?
It'll be okay. I'll fix my lasagna. We ll smoke a joint. Tensions will melt away.
You're right. You know I was thinking that we should have Maxine over for dinner. Since you two are partners and all. It might be a nice gesture.
...can we see the Kitten...?
Stuff it, man!
The dishes are juiced up, too.
Milo? Shrot suspects somebody broke into 21. I was in his office when he was reviewing the card readouts.
He doesn't know about the Day Care.
Yeah, that's old, in a tree.
Right.
And so it is. I'll talk to you later.
No.
All the figures show is that Gordon LaRiviere is going to be a very rich man using his position as Selectman. In a year or two, you won't recognize this town.
Details, Pokrif. From what I saw he had an incredible body.
Yeah... Mmmm...
What did he do? Did he do anything that was different?
Everything was different.
Well, it you're not gonna ask, then I will. How was it?
Great.
The IRS contacted me this morning. They say my lifestyle and receipts exceed my income.
For the last four years.
You don't work there anymore, Bobby.
That doesn't make any sense.
Because I just saw Johnnie downstairs.
They just left, didn't they?
You mean they weren't up here?
What?... Oh suck my fucking dick!
It's totally sickening. Let's see if they gave me the right diploma...
I know, I liked her better when she was an alcoholic crack addict! She gets in one car wreck and all of a sudden she's Little Miss Perfect and everybody loves her.
I thought Chipmunk-face was never going to shut up.
God, what a bunch of retards...
These assholes are saying that I have to go to Summer school and take some stupid art class!
What?
How would you know anything?
Duff--
Well, there's a problem.
Oh Norville, I --
Why?
Pretty strange.
It's just a scratch. You won't die. She turns away from him.
Get away from me.
I didn't say I didn't love you. I said stay away from me.
No, I'll go. You stay... In case she wakes up.
I should go get some of her things.
By accident?
The nanobot is the only thing that can stabilize the waste.
You're just a stepmother. So stop bossing, cos nobody's listening!
Yes.
Did you always want to be a lawyer?
Did Sam call to tell you he wouldn't be over this weekend?
You invented him! You've completely made his up!
This is your life story, Wilbur! You just changed the dates!
These credentials are against the law!
Rafe --
You suck.
Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
Will this go on my record?
Kinda. Yeah.
It's been 84 years... and I can still smell the fresh paint. The china had never been used. The sheets had never been slept in.
I know that, Sergeant. We were just dancing. There was a bunch of us there. Shadow just come down looking for trouble.
I'm sorry, Sergeant Major. There wasn't anything I could do. Shadow gets crazy--
Out of the Army?
Fifteen years, huh?
Yeah. Oh, God bless!
Well, uh... You're what Grammy Hall would call a real Jew.
Yeah, well... you- She hates Jews. She thinks that they just make money, but let me tell yuh, I mean, she's the one yeah, is she ever. I'm tellin' yuh.
What are you doing here? Are you all right? How do you expect to pay for this? Everyone's looking for you, Jake. I dodged people all over the place, reporters, police. I don't know what you're gonna do.
Sailors are sadistic, I feel.
I guess.
I am.
Oh, Miles. That's awful. What are you going to do?
So what's happening with your book?
How?
Not me. I'm not drinking.
Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time -- ?
I understand. Thanks anyway.
Jesus, I look like a raccoon.
One day you will.
Kids on a joy ride. Happens all the time.
Demons, Jake? Come on. They're winos and bag ladies. Low life. That's all they are. The streets are crawling with 'em. Don't make em into somethin' they're not. It's the pressure, honey. That's all it is.
New York is filled with creatures. Everywhere. And lots of stations are closed.
It's still there, Jake. Even if you never say a word about it. You can't spend two years in Vietnam ...
It has nothin' to do with talkin'.
Don't make me raise my hand to you. You have to see for yourself that you are going in the wrong direction.
I've heard some foolish things in my life.
Have you lost your mind? Have you thought about your wife and child, not to mention your sick father? And I need your help to move his bed from under the leak in the ceiling.
What are those?
Yes -- I'm on a good streak, thanks.
Tom, you startled me! You're back.
Just think about it. That's all I ask.
You too.
... I don't understand it. All I can think is that maybe because the video gear wasn't accounted for in the original plans it somehow violated the integrity of the design.
But the machine worked -- that's what I've been trying to tell everyone! The tape -- it's all there, if they'd just look at... ... the tape...
Trust me. We're safe.
I don't have an official response, Michael. All I have are the same questions you have.
Never stand between that kid and a meatball.
Hi, I'm here to pick up Ben.
Yes.
Smile.
We're going to have to stop for gas soon.
Minneapolis.
'They won't.'
Stop.
Good, cuz talking to you is like trying to explain red to a blind person.
We were suite mates.
Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor. If they're good, they get known. And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse. I'm sorry, Viktor.
The picture's dead.
They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.
Well, we must keep in mind the Dower Laws. One third of everything we have is mine and since our Negroes have been interbreeding, it would be legally impossible to distinguish them.
Leave me, now sir, I am tired.
Don't condescend to me! We have both of us prospered from the arrangements of our kind...
Not today.
You didn't?
No, I didn't bleed.
But what's gotten into you?... We would have known. Sandro must be out in the garden somewhere, taking a breath of fresh air, or watching the break of dawn. It would be a lovely surprise indeed if he turned out to be the sentimental type.
I'm afraid that Anna has come back. I feel she's back, and that they're together.
Yes, yes, of course.
More or less, we are all afraid. Especially at night.
Patrizia, I'm afraid.
Ettore...
Would you please see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. I'm sorry to disturb you.
Nothing, nothing at all. I was just looking for Sandro.
It's the gratitude of your party, and of your President...
Someplace where no one knows her. Someplace strange and new.
No...I just... I'm so fucked up here Alan, I don't know...there's so much...so many things --
Like a shrink, like if I go to see a shrink, I'm protected, I can say things -- fuck -- I don't know what I'm doing --
If I talk to you...y'know...if I tell you things...then you're a lawyer, right? You can't say things, you can't tell anyone, it's like the privelage, right? Attornery-client, you understand?
-- I have something to tell you. I have to tell you something. I want to change his will, can I change his will?...I need to ---
You want me to stay here?
All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom, I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky -- age sixty-three -- getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that. Do you?
Those are my children you're practicing on. They deserve first- rate care. Every minute. Of every night. And every day.
What home?
A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
God I guess i'll have to introduce you now.
Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of -- Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning me a dozen times a day -- sending twenty telegrams -- all the rest of it, because I'm --
It's got to be here. I heard him talk about it. He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
Yes. Are you shaking?
Hey Sandy.
There has to be!
Sure. Twinkie?
Yeah? See ya.
Did you tell Sandy?
What about the studio? What about De Mille?
Nick!
What?
It didn't come up.
She says Juliet's in a terrible state . . .
I've just had Hilda Hulme on the phone.
You got your F-14, you got Top Gun, you got your MiGs....You're our new Top Gun instructor...Now what?
Well?
Some times...
One little piece of cake won't hurt you. Go ahead, take one. It's full of fruit...citron, cherries and ginger. It'll make you dream. Yes, wonderful dreams.
No, thank you.
Who is she?
She's always spying on me. She creeps into the room. She lives upstairs, yet she's always watching me always!
There you are. Take some cake, why don't you?
That woman is an imposter, a liar, and a cheat. How do you like your tea? AMY Well... .sometimes I got a spoonful of tea in a cup of hot milk.
But I only came to give back the ring.
Stranger? Julia Farren a stranger. Why I've played every theatre from Boston to San Francisco. I've been to London and Paris. Those days those beautiful, shilling, golden days.
The ring? We'll have no more nonsense about the ring.
...yes.
Scotland. He intends --
You directed me to report to you the moment the king's conference was ended.
He said you were smart. He also said you were competing with your dead father. How did he put it? Trying to measure up to a ghost.
I know who you are. You're the policeman Bud told me about.
He can take care of himself and I'm not afraid of you. And you forgot one thing, Lieutenant. Pierce also taught me how to fuck... Can I get you a drink?
They'll mend.
Shit happens.
No, Will, this isn't the alcohol talking. It's the truth.
No.
Yes.
You get it yet?
I was trying to protect you from this...
Where are you going?
What? And have Federal agents jump out of the bushes with court orders? How many years do you get in this state for giving second-rate care to minors?
Want me to get a towel?
I don't want you to move.
I'm telling you straight, if you have any serious ambitions, stay clear of the place. It'll crush you.
I don't think you will. It's your father's.
I'll do nothing of the sort.
All right, then. I'll tell them.
Now do you believe me!
No, I don't hate it.
...Not if I can help it.
What odds?
What?
I know.
Well, most people are stupid. You want to talk about odds? One day I'll tell you how I survived as the youngest in a family of three sons. You wanna talk about odds?
Yes, but, you're a willing participant. Picture Edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...
Honey, she won't d...
Wow.
Yeah?
When Nando died--it was so sudden--I was kind of in shock for awhile. Then I woke up and there was the whole rest of my life and I didn't have any idea what to do with it.
I mean what did we know about anything?
That's what I was going to ask you. he's disappeared!
Goodnight, Senator--
Where are you?
Where are you?
Give me an hour.
Did you get a room?
I'll be there in an hour.
Of course. You idiot. I always wear it. I've always worn it. I've always loved you.
Anita, when you wanted to seduce the guy in the mailroom and you didn't think you could learn Spanish fast enough, who quizzed you on your verbs?
Three.
Zach from work ?
I've been going to debtor's anonymous. You want to see some truly fucked up people?
Like testicular cancer?
This isn't a for-real suicide thing. This is probably one of those cry-for- help things.
In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
Are you scared of me?
I thought you were tired of your business?
Sure I can't twist your arm?
Wanna go?
You're doing fine. You didn't actually lift me though. It was more like you supported me.
I need to... I need to believe something. This is the first time I've ever come up against anything I couldn't... understand.
Do you want your buttons on the left or the right?
Yes.
Uh huh.
Oh, thank you Lord! I'm so glad to see you! I need to confess... I haven't been confessed since Easter... or been to Mass... Will you hear me now?
You said, "Apples aren't exactly flying."
Wally thinks apples are boring.
You been through the Dilbert Dunker yet?
Well, it's the Jack Kennedy Syndrome, huh? You die young, you always look golden. Perfect. The memory kind of burnishes the image, and...
Give it to me!
ehh...Okay...but be careful, it has a lot of sentimental value.
Don't force it, you'll break it.
Up to?
Just give it to me!!
Is your brother a flyer?
Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits, ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin' to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell.
I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote?
Yeah.
Vietnam?
I'm not like you, you have your wife.
I know that you used to work with an architect.
Well...he's not that strange, don't say that.
He did seem a little strange.
I have no idea what he's doing then. I'm sorry that didn't work out.
No.
You wouldn't want to go out with him anyway, honestly, he's such a freak sometimes.
It's fine.
Just tell him to call me.
Ok. What should I do about Eric?
So...did my brother call you?
Ok.
Well, stop listening to him.
H'h, that's a polite word for what you are.
Oh, come on, we've seen it. I'm not in the mood to see a four-hour documentary on Nazis.
Alright. All right, all right, so whatta you wanna do?
That depends what you re looking at.
Well, yes, she's happy. Of course Dave doesn't have her life force, not at all. There isn't much furniture in his house, just a table and one or two chairs, whereas Rose has furniture coming out of the windows.
Your watch.
You're so sweet.
Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging.
Well, I think it's charming, Rose. But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight?
Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all.
Yeah. I'm goin' out.
Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful.
Yes, I think so. He adores her, it's almost pitiful the way he worships her. I just hope she isn't too much for him.
I told her you're doing a
Not now. I don't have time.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over. All this time. Hiding. Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was. Never trusting anyone...
You'd rather spoil our walk home.
It's an observation. Like: I'm hungry. When are we eating?
Might be an accident on the West Side Highway.
It's not a knock.
Find anything?
No.
Somebody must live here!
No... I can't... I got tired. I want to live my way.
Asshole. But she won't miss anything, that. You'll see.
You see, we've just--oh, you tell him, darling. I'm so embarrassed I could die!
Oh, we can manage that! I'll scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...
You decide, darling. Remember our budget.
Oh, Jim!
There's just one thing. What about--
No. You're not specific enough to be a person. You're more like a vibe.
I got fired.
So have I. ... Hello?
I'm sorry, I usually would call Rajeev, but I didn't know what to do so I called Mr. Bianchinni.
Not exactly.
Yeah, come on in.
He said you lost something.
It was Grandma's. It's not for playing. What if it broke? You know how sad I'd be.
I don't know what gets into me.
Did STEPHANIE kill your MOTHER?
Calvin!
Do you?
You work too hard, John.
I'll be out in a minute.
You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes.
You knew what we were asking you to do. Don't suddenly pull out a conscience now. The fit isn't right.
Oh yeah, he's the real fireman. Who are you? Just another probie working for Swayzak --
Let me ask you something, do you really think Marty had you assigned to arson because of your firefighting skills? Who the hell are you kidding? I was there, remember? I saw you and your brother --
I was doing my job.
Henry. Wake up.
Just a minute. I'll pour you some coffee.
Good morning.
I know. Sleep now, Liebchen.
Fine. You know Dr. Schwartz retired last month?
What kind of food?
Close.
What do you want to tell me?
What is it, Eddie?
Your tie. I never saw you wear one before.
Let's get out of here, fast... This is not a town, it's a cemetery.
Mother...
I'm more interested in what he says, not what he looks like.
Yeah, well Max offers a lot of things. And I got news for you. He's not the sweet old man you think he is.
Don't get my hopes up. If I quit, what then? I can't go through this again.
I'm with you, lover.
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE!
THERE'S NO ONE IN MY MOTHERFUCKIN CLOSET AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM, STAY OUT OF MY GOD DAMN BEDROOM.
Thank you, Uncle.
Rye.
Sometimes I think-sometimes I think I should just live with a woman.
Why do you keep calling me, Jeff? What do you want from me?
-- same sauce -- sweet and sour.
Let's not start on that again, Jeff -- please. I'm just beginning to get over it.
Look, Jeff -- we had two wonderful months this summer -- and that was it. Happens all the time -- the wife and kids go away to the country, and the boss has a fling with the secretary or the manicurist -- or the elevator girl. Comes September, the picnic is over -- goodbye. The kids go back to school, the boss goes back to the wife, and the girl -- They don't make these shrimp like they used to.
For a while there, you try kidding yourself that you're going with an unmarried man. Then one day he keeps looking at his watch, and asks you if there's any lipstick showing, then rushes off to catch the seven-fourteen to White Plains. So you fix yourself a cup of instant coffee -- and you sit there by yourself -- and you think -- and it all begins to look so ugly --
Don't turn around. Keep your eyes on the book.
I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive.
You're my mother's hairdresser?
I've lost half a pound since Tuesday.
You never wanna try anything new, Alvy.
Yes. It was very good to see her.
Go on...
No... What I mean is... I'm just very excited by the prospect of getting on with my life, that's all.
Not at all. She brought me my fan mail. I had no idea there were so many strangers concerned about me. But I guess that's the best thing about working in the movies. You make so many friends. I want to go back and show them that the faith they put in me wasn't a mistake.
To keep from being an old maid.
Ugh!! Why do they have to do that?
They think we like it. Maybe they think it turns us on.
So what do you think we're gonna talk about?
If a soldier loses his legs in a war. Is he the same guy? Sure he is.
You got to watch those things. Wives are getting smarter all the time. Take Mr. Bernheim -- in the Claims Department -- came home one night with lipstick on his shirt -- told his wife he had a shrimp cocktail for lunch -- so she took it out to the lab and had it analyzed -- so now she has the house in Great Neck and the children and the new Jaguar --
Why did we stop?
A pocketful of fucking rye. What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nicholas...
What did the king say?
Neither can I.
Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold.
I'm numb.
Can't complain, ma'am.
No.
Damn it! Why won't you give me a straight answer, for once?!
Enzo, why do you guys do this?
What are you doing here?
It won't leave much of a balance in the bank... Mr. Robard? Could you locate him?
That makes five days in a row that Mr. Hunsecker's cut you out of his column.
But...
The renting agent and the tailor.
You haven't noticed my latest bit of interior decorating...
I couldn't get into the girdle in two an' a half hours...
When we get home you're going to get into one of those girdles and act for two and half hours.
Something maybe grew a size bigger.
You bought the new girdles a size smaller. I can feel it.
When he gets too close, I'll spit in his eye.
During your second act scene with your father, Roger Ferraday's supposed to stay way upstage at the arch. He's been coming closer down every night...
Well, teacher's away and actors will be actors...
I mean the performance. Except for you, you'd think he'd never even directed it - it's disgraceful the way they change everything around...
You certainly can. Especially if you're me between now and tomorrow morning...
You made us what we are, didn't you?
And if I cut my hair again?
Why not?
I've been ok.
I'm hungry, John.
Where are we goin', John?
Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough.
I want to go upstairs. It's cold and spidery down here. I'm hungry.
just let me walk out, ok?
Oh-what a nice outfit!
Good theory. But I like my mother. I have no aversions to what she does.
You like that?
Hey, do you want to have a drink? I have lots of drinks. And I could --
Never mind. Sorry, that was stupid. I'm embarrassed. Good night, Joel.
This... someone gave that to me, just like, recently. I like it, too. I like crows. I think I used to be a crow.
Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again.
Yes, it was -- I ended up --
I'm asking you, as a...friend. You'd be saving the life of a friend.
You DIDN'T tell me. Do you mean Malahide's got...
The box. I need the box.
What do you mean?
What?
Yes!
No, no -- you can't stay or they won't come!
Then do me a favor and get rid of her. If not for me, then do it for you. Look at yourself. You're a joke. She's turned you into jelly. What do you want to be, one of those losers who walk down the halls holding hands and smiling. People used to respect you. They feared you and now you're going to throw that all away.
Why so nervous?
If not, firing will only give away our position to hostiles in the area. Now how smart is that?
At first it was, but now it's become something bigger.
I'm sorry. It's just upsetting. You're in love with her. You don't love me anymore.
Is that what you think?
Not anymore you don't. It's obvious.
But you don't have any symptoms!
But there's nothing wrong with you.
I don't know. Cancer, I--
Well, he has to rule out certain things.
Do you want some food?
My son was outside playing soccer. I never saw him playing ball. Come on, you guys -- take me out for a good time... Take me out dancing.
There are certain things I wouldn't do for my country.
No, mostly his wife's. She's in Paris, France, right now. My husband Delbert is real friendly with him. Delbert's in law. Does work for him.
No, I don't.
Just my church and my boys. We all had to go to school and learn hand talking. I just thank the Lord they can see.
He's a member of our congregation.
And inside these glasses are these slide photographs. And each photograph is of something peaceful... or beautiful. Whatever pictures the parent wants to put inside.
Infant Memory Generators.
You dog!
He had his hand on her titty.
Do you have many friends?
I will be in three months. I can't wait. I hate being eleven. It has to be the stupidest age in the world.
It sounds like you were banished.
How come?
Birds are my friends. That sounds egotistical, but they are. Birds know I watch them, but they don't mind because they like being watched... if they know you won't hurt them.
Robert Eroica...
Well, you look better than you did yesterday.
This is not the way people who care for each other are supposed to behave.
I case you don't know--I want to give ya a chance to back out if you don't like it--
My first name's--Clarissa.
Where?
Yeah--that's right. Diz--
Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think it's beautiful.
That was just perfect. You've ruined me for anyone else.
I used to live here.
It's all, gone wrong, nothing's working out.
You were meant to. You're one of those fortunate people that good things happen to. I have to get out of here.
Rosalie, please, listen to me! You have to stop.
We'll see you soon, honey. Bye.
Don't let him stay up too late.
Good, that'll put him to sleep early. No offense.
You flatter, my lord.
Forgot your keys --
That's the first time I ever saw him kiss a man, like a dad, wasn't that just... thrilling? I mean, he must have been needing that.
Virginia?!
You don't believe it was a car accident.
You always do this to me.
You can?
What do you mean?
God, no.
Well, I kind of tried once. It just seemed stupid, I kept seeing myself lying there and it seemed stupid, and kind of, uh, I don't know, and then I was wondering if my dead grandfather could see me doing this, and it just seemed like a dumb thing to be doing when we don't know what to do with all that garbage, you know?
Well, kind of recently, I guess. But not too recently.
Gee, Grady, that sounded so heartfelt. I don't know whether to swoon or smirk.
It should be just up ahead. Hold on ... there! There it is!
People make mistakes.
What ?
Arguing about books.
I didn't like that book either. It's all about men. Too many men. Just like this house.
I don't think it does. Anyway, he's indifferent to me.
The amusing thing is that you deceive me without knowing, if it is true that you love me.
To make me wretched in two weeks.
You want my heart?
How so?
Mostly caffeine diuretics. Help you go to the bathroom.
The nanobot is still inside you. It's programmed to exit through the urinary tract. We need it as soon as possible, so swallow those.
If you don't want to do it this way, I can remove it surgically.
But you deceive me nonetheless if I believe you, for it will not be in your power to love me when you love me no longer.
Ring the bell before you try the door.
What?
You saw it once. Now you see it again. That's life, isn't it? And you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?
This time? Almost a year. I've known him forever.
What were you two fighting about?
Uh-uh.
Gimme one anyway.
How long you been with Ordell?
Killian's.
Better get me another Sam's. Join me in a Jaeger shot?
Bobby? What the hell's the matter with you?
You left that guy alone in the room?
Taking a shower.
I'm sorry. I am happy. I'm very happy for you. I'm glad you had a good time. It's about time. Where is he now?
Pretty girl.
Oh, my God!
By the way, how is your father's side?
Thats not a story, Alex. It's a corpse.
Please, Paul, 'til first light.
Travis?
Asta - don't bother Mr. Macaulay.
Oh, he's sitting up.
Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
OK.
The yellow and pink.
It's just such a mess. With Jake I mean...
Is he alright? What happened?
Five minutes and fifty seconds.
Nothin'.
Why, Cyril, you're insane
Why are you so anxious?
No.
What?
Now wait a minute, wait a minute...
I don't see why you're still here. You look healthy to me.
"Security"? What the hell you talkin' about? Your base isn't secure?
Uh, ma'am.
You're just comfortable, that's all. You don't even ask to go home. You just lie around, let your mama take care of you.
Jordan, dear. How are they treating you?
For whoever's in that thing.
See, it's my life story. Five more minutes and I would have got to hear your best pick-up line.
You say that like I don't know that.
And when did that pass?
Duncan. My work is everything to me. This'll never happen again. Now stand back -- this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though I wouldn't sleep with you -- Cooper let's get these penguins dancing --
Just do it, okay?
Shut up! I'll not let you put anything in my hand until I see some money.
Oh, God.
Oh, you --
No! Don't go.
Why were you sitting here, instead of...
That asshole smashed in my fucking neck!
Signs?
I can't.
Open and shut? Open and fucking shut?
Will we live together?
He came tearing around the corner, out of control --
Do you really mean that?
I am?
Why am I great?
Honey?
I did exist. I do exist. I'm the same person!
Gentlemen of the Press! Always picking on somebody who can't defend himself -- the littler the better.
Who is it?
What? Hey -- he hit me.
Oh, gosh, I don't know. Well, could I come over tomorrow and read it to you?
Hmm. I think it's lucky I ran into you. Maybe.
Oh, well.
What's your point?
Let's do it here.
Me, too.
Talking to me, dad?
You wouldn t be here if I knew, Mr Lombard. What I do know is that he has not been at work for three weeks. That enquiries to the police and London hospitals have borne no results. And that a check with his bank revealed he has not used his account for four weeks now.
I'm aware.
Cecile.
Have you ever let a romantic moment make you do something you know is stupid?
I'm leaving you Jake.
That's maybe the best compliment of my life.
I don't quite get how that's a compliment for me.
No. This time it's true. I didn't bother to tell you until I had everything worked out.
Here's the trouble with never.
I think he owes more to you. But that's not important now. I know what's going on between you two.
You don't have to protect my feelings, Simone. I don't blame Viktor for falling in love with the most desirable woman in the world.
No, I understand. That's what I want to talk about. I don't know if you know this, Simone, but Viktor and I were married once.
My God, are you alright, Simone?
I think ...
Do you think you know me like that?
Caesar, what happened?
Just of getting hurt. They can't touch me inside.
Fuck her yet?
Fuck you, Johnny Utah. Fuck you!! Don't you have a soul? Goddamn you to hell!
Just not to me.
You'll never guess what happened! I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already!
-- You remember.
The great communicator.
He deserved it. He was born deserving it.
Okay.
If you bring the caramels.
That's fine.
Just an accident. Nothing.
Now, get out!!
Stop that ma'am crap!
Could we talk about that a little later?
Thank you.
Get out!
What kind of doggy is that?
You almost got us killed!
I bet you try on my coffin some day -- I hope it "fits just perfect."
Lloyd and I.
Max is paying for it. He and Lloyd had a terrific row but Lloyd insisted... well. Can I fix you a drink?
Lloyd. I never have any, and he likes a couple of drinks after we finish - so he sent it up...
That's for tonight. You're invited. We're having everyone up after the performance.
He said he worked there --
I know. For the first time I'm beginning to be frightened. I almost feel as if I'd never known my sister.
I don't get this. Miss Jacqueline was always so fond of you -- she was always talking about you - had your picture in her office.
You mean Miss Jacqueline's gone, and you don't know where she is?
I don't know. That's why I came to see Mrs. Redi. I'm trying to find her.
How's Miss Jacqueline?
Hello, Frances.
Why, Mary --
I'm stopping at the Chatsworth.
I'll put this in the back.
All the professionals keep them in the trunk.
So how are you doing with those pills? Well, I hopahopahopa.
Yes, Michael.
Look, I know this sounds corny, but whenever I feel like I can't go on I... turn to Jesus and he helps me through the problem. Call me an anachronism, but -
Don't . . . please! Please, don't!
I think I'm dying . . .
Truman, stop it!
That's camouflage...
So I can spend the rest of my life guessing what it would be like to be a real artist?
I will not have them on my conscience. They will stay in my room.
Where have you been?
No one's asking you to!
Do you want know the real reason why I became a bounty hunter?
How the hell would you know anything about the human heart?
...gger.
Nigger, fuck me hard!
Fuck me hard!
Nigger, fuck me hard!!...
Did you used to?
Mr. Williams . . .
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones!
You have no idea what you've done to me, do you? And after you leave, I'm going to have to wonder for the rest of my life what happened here. If anything happened at all! And I'll have to wonder if you find yourself in some... housewife's kitchen in Romania if you'll sit there and tell her about your world of good friends and secretly include me in that group.
You won't be committing a crime. The man will cheat, you'll just be doing your job, that's all.
I've come to know you. You're honest. I trust you.
It won't.
Nothing.
Where are you?
Help me live until I die?
All the time. I feel like I have no one.
He's still at the bank.
No. The drugs just stopped working. If anything, doing things I love kept me healthy longer.
Well...I think you should feel very proud. You did a real nice thing for somebody else. I'm very proud.
There isn't any more to tell.
Hey, why don't you swallow your cock and choke on it? Oh, I forgot, it's not big enough.
It does look good.
The Blue Men?
Tell me a story, John.
You're pretty full of yourself, aren't you?
But you'll hurt your eyes doin it there. Come sit at the table.
My mother told me never to accept offers from strangers.
No..No that won't do...
Mama...Mama she's asleep. Why don't you eat something.
You got types?
That's why they have state borders... whyn't you get a replacement?
No, we just had lunch at the hotel with my brother and his new wife. She told me all the dirt. I forgot how interesting things can get around here. It was so good to see them. The last time we visited they were in Europe. He is doing so well. He ordered champagne. For lunch! I nearly died.
Boy. It sure has been a long time.
Well, that's a long time.
Because I didn't know...
Why didn't you do anything to stop her?
I knew that after the fact.
To watch...? To watch me...?
Larry...
Well... THIS.
I know you -- you're the one who called. You're Castor Troy. You killed my son --
If-if my car is there, I could be the one who... Why don t you accuse me of killing my brother?
A hotel?
Don't be ridiculous. I arranged a press conference.
Well, Bill was ALWAYS the author, so to speak-
I can't wait to meet her.
Why not?
Well -- I -- I don't know -- I would pay our debts and well -- maybe get a new bonnet, but -- really -- I think I would live the same.
Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
Time? Oh, no Calvin. It's not time yet. I still have--
I can't.
Before what?
What I'm trying to say is, I've loved you since I was eleven and the shit won't go away.
Sagittarius. I like Sagittarians. You can trust them.
You asked me what was missing.
And he's been commissioned to write an opera. Is it true?
Madame Cavalieri is here for her lesson, sir.
Maestro.
Well? How do you like it? It's Turkish. My hairdresser tells me everything's going to be Turkish this year!
Well, I heard you met Herr Mozart.
Should I tell you why I joined our late lamented nihilists? Why I became a murderer? Because murder ... is bliss. It's easier than you might think to absorb and assimilate Evil -- once you've adopted its procedure.
I know how they reward failure. If they saw this I'd be rotting in the quarries by the afternoon -- with all the others.
Calm down. You're not into anything. It was my problem, you offered no help. It's got nothing to do with your investigation.
No.
Are you a traveller?
It never is.
Her husband docks tomorrow, does he?
I see.
Will this do?
But not over me?
I had no idea you knew each other.
I'm amazed that she'll let you drive her.
No, I couldn't. I feel too close to her.
Renata tells me you're going to rent a car.
How can you drive? James... your legs. You can Barely walk.
I've never really noticed. Is Renata going with you?
I go to school, don't I?
OhmyGod. Didn't she say anything? She must've said something.
Ted, all I wanted to know was where--
Ted, Joanna and I used to talk a lot and...well, she told me a lot of...ah, things about the two of you.
Ted, don't be so hostile.
Have fun.
It's really not the same thing. He was really nicer when he drank.
You're right -- that is sick.
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
They came all the way from Tarzana.
Paula, look at the new Poopies.
See you in a month when you get liberty!
Don't worry. It grows out about an inch by them.
Are you all right?
Shhh.
Why don't you just drag me off if you want to marry me so much?
It's Grandma. I can't talk to her now. I'm sorry, Grandma.
Who was that man?
It was nobody. Ah... he's a poll, taker. I'm thinking of voting Democrat this year. But don't mention it to your father. How was school today?
It was great to see everybody again. But it's so boring and regimented. Most of what they teach is useless. The worst thing was lunch.
Sure, Mom. Hello.
Benjamin -- I haven't even said I'll marry you yet.
How much?
We're 125 million dollars in debt?
Please. Please don't walk away.
Marty did. But I wanted you to come to.
You think that's really any of your business?
You treated me like shit.
You want some coffee?
Where are we going?
You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert. Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving?
Who is it?
Well, the studio told me not to.
Why you drinking so much?
Well, what do you wanna talk about!
Jeremy! How Fantastic.
Paul.
I didn't see him. I was in my underwear. If it was a white guy, it was probably Louis. He kill Melanie?
Not in the fitting room.
I went looking for you. I went straight to the bookstore, 'cause that's where you were last time, but you weren't there. How the hell else am I supposed to let anybody know what happened? You didn't tell me how to do that, did you? I knew I was under surveillance, so when I couldn't spot anybody, I started yelling.
Are they all crazies?
You either.
Okay, Mack! Whoowe, Candy girl, are we in an insane asylum or ain't we?
Transshipped to a Malaysian container ship.
...and we're looking at Nigerian crude...
Will you relax. There's nobody back there.
Whatup Lenny?
Where we going?
What is it?
George! What are you doing here?
Wings?
What is this?
Tired.
To invite you to his house -- the two of you could just sit under the shade tree, drink ice cold whiskey, and just shoot the breeze!
I had to.
Right behind us -- Dunois with another then thousand men!
Yes. All those things are true.
Your whacked-out, bald freaks hit me with a fucking broom. I thought they were going to break my arm.
The were burning their fingertips with lye. The stink was unbelievable.
We keep them, in case the people come back.
Go! Go! Get in the car! Go!
Oh, what bullshit? What, do you want to fuckin' talk it over now?
Get your bag! Come on, get your bag! Get your things! Let's go!
What do you think we're gonna do? He's probably got guys outside the fuckin' house!
That's - Yeah, he's sitting by the phone like a dumb-bell, just waiting for you to call him back. That's what he's -
I was grateful.
But he wasn't killed.
Well, I suppose I am... actually I knew about the affair.
Why?
What do you do - for a living I mean?
Huh...the restaurant's just around the corner here...
How?
How do you know he's telling the truth?
No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail.
I think these cold, "objective" discussions are aggressive, Samia...
Why am I doing this?
What universe are you in, Paul?
You haven't dampened my spirit, Samia... Excuse me.
I've decided that if it is God, it's a sick God. Its ambitions exceed its powers, but it doesn't realize it. It's created a situation without a goal, and I hate that. A God whose passion is not a redemption, who saves nothing, fulfills no purpose. And us? We would have to have "an arrangement". An unspoken understanding that I am not human. How can I not hate something that does that?
Shhh.
I'm in till the end.
Nothing's happening.
I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew.
What are you looking at, out there? There's nothing to see.
Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
Well . . . no. But it's so obvious.
This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial?
You think about your father a lot, don't you?
Oh Jesus...! I'll make some coffee. They left the stove.
The Hulmes will look after me. They want me to live with them!
Why do you want a room here?
Don't be so ridiculous. You're our daughter, you belong here with us.
He's in Jamaica with a twenty-three- year-old. A friend of my daughter's. He had the fucking nerve to call me and ask me to borrow some money and I told him to fuck off, so he asked me to sell his singles collection and send him a check for whatever I go, minus a ten percent commission. Which reminds me. Can you make sure you give me a five? I want to frame it and put it on the wall.
I must have nothing. Their my husband's.
That wasn't part of the deal. I want to be poisonous but fair.
Years. This collection is as close as he's ever come to an achievement.
Bud, it's the pressure. Try to concentrate. Concentrate on my voice. Just listen to my voice.
Suit yourself. There are plenty of others who will.
I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
I'm going out!
I just put them to bed. Can we come to the meeting tomorrow?
Dear heart, where are you?
Malcolm, they keep calling, threatening us. I'm going crazy, when is this going to stop?
Stop calling us. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I'll kill you. I'll kill you.
Communicate?
Is it now?
Is it now?
They did?
She's mistaken.
It isn't true. You have to believe me.
I don't use cocaine anymore. If she says she saw me doing it she's lying.
I don't know, Frank -- but don't you think that's something we should find out?
Oh, they knew. They had to know.
Relax, Seymour, relax...
This shocking image of repressed femininity!
Very good. Now, what can you tell us about it in regard to your artistic intent?
Don't give me that. You're gonna get plenty rich off of this, Mr. 40 percent. We got those PG E fuckers by the balls here.
I think it's really a wonderful piece, Margaret!
I mean, she was asleep. I was going to be right back before she even woke up.
Did you?
You look nice. I should have dressed.
Better.
It means you can do anything.
Just saying good-bye to everyone before you leave?
Uh, yeah... I'll bring it down.
Leave it -- I'll wash it for you.
But it's Christmas now.
Mmmm... You give good compliment. Clean up and come back to bed.
Those are your clothes, silly.
What?
You're not seriously buying into Darren's nonsense.
He was just trying to blame you 'cause he's a slut.
Hell yeah. There's not the slightest grain of truth in anything that idiot was saying. You are a totally down-ass female and a straight-up friend who happens to be a little...
You know what I'm saying.
You dance splendidly.
You're trembling.
You must look at my face and not at the floor.
You're crazy.
Your book - that's why you were always in the cellar!
N-no, sir?
...So he's dictating you a new bestseller? Whatever that is, it's not our son.
You do have a vivid imagination, Mr Lombard. I only wish you d use it fruitfully instead of in being obnoxious. I fail to understand your purpose in this. Still, say what you re owed if you still wish to be paid or get out, all right?
Think Eddie had something to do with it?
Do you know who did this?
My god...
A dead body?
Bruce... what's going on? The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
Yes. Yes it was.
How long has he been this sick?
Why was I not told earlier?
You should never have gone out in such foul weather.
It's just a corpse.
What night?
It must be from a real estate agent.
Huh?... oh, yeah, it is.
No, nothing.
Why... I don t know what you re talking about.
I just want you to know. No matter what you do. You are going to die, just like everybody else.
We've been talking to -- well, let's just call him Sleepless in Seattle, and we'll be right back after this break with listener response, your response, to the things we've been discussing. The number to call is...
I want Sunny to have an advantage that you and I never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when I tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.
You jackass! C'mon, let's get out of here.
What?
Still looking.
Jesus.
This, is our baby Peter. Yours and mine. Aren't you proud?
What is it?
Is he staying the night?
When are you coming home?
Yes?
Yes?
Hello.
Mef? What's Mef?
It's initials. F is Feur. It's her.
Norville, I'm sorry, I... I tried to tell you... so many times... It's hard to admit when you've been wrong. If you could just... find it in your heart to -- to give me another chance --
Just give me another chance, Norville -- I can help you fight this thing. I know this last story was a lie! We can prove it! We can --
Well that just about does it! I've seen Norville Barnes, the young man in a big hurry, and I've seen Norville Barnes the self-important heel, but I've never seen Norville Barnes the quitter, and I don't like it!
See you in a minute, sweetheart.
I'll take you home, Angela. Why don't you leave those with us for a while?
It doesn't matter, Mr Crane.
No. Mother Superior told me to come.
Travis, I never ever met anybody like you before.
Where do you live?
So why did you decide to drive a taxi at night?
After this job, I'm looking forward to being alone for a while.
What kind of people?
Thank you.
Bus hit him.
I know that. I do what I want.
You'll eat this bloody to feed your blood.
Loretta.
He knew my husband who died.
And what?
And... do whatever it is you do.
But he won't.
What are you talking about?
He's not getting a phone, he doesn't like talking on the phone.
Let me talk to him first.
Why? Just give me the address, you won't even have to be involved.
I don't feel right just giving you the address so that you can go over there and...
Where... where am I?
Because Iris knew somebody was after her.
No, really, thank you. -- Is Mrs. Webster coming back soon?
It's not your fault.
I know.
Hi.
You're keeping a record, are you?
Oh?
Thank you. This was so unnecessary. I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much. We keep him in at night.
Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis.
Ryan.
Too bad.
I don't get it.
I don't know. But it was weird in terms of what happened next. Sean was still watching his mother.
You don't have to go.
Dick, you should call Bobby.
They've lost a brother. You know what that means, Dick.
Then call him. I'm sure it was an oversight.
I don't know. When you say it, it sounds crazy. But what else could it all be?
Oh no no no no no. See, my family, we don't go to college. We just go right into sheep herding.
It's hard to see any change. But I'm going to stay. Another year, anyway.
It s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
I'm suspicious of men who want to marry. I believe they think it's the only thing that will make them equal to their fathers.
Thanks. Wow. That's--really nice to hear.
Now where do we go ?
Plan on a longer visit next time.
It's a shame!
Really.
You were talking in your sleep.
Of all the cheap excuses. To break a child's heart.
Because I don't want to see him hurt.
No, are you crazy? And I don't want him ever to know. Do you understand?...
I want to ask you a big favor, Gordon. Please drop the Bluestar deal.
It's not puppy love, Gordon. Anyway, Buddy and I are splitting up.
Excuse me?
Two or three years ago I would have stayed. And fucked you.
There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like Sam.
Say goodnight to Sam for me.
Yeah.
So, how does it feel to be kissed by two women?
Here.
Me and the muse, of course. How is your book coming along?
Let's not talk about that now.
I have some brownies left over. Want one?
What? No. I don't like the term boyfriend. It's so gay.
Is that a problem?
Goodbye, Mr. Baxter.
I don't want to lose you.
I've been better. Next time it's your turn, okay?
Hi, tough guy. I guess it worked, huh?
Hey... big boys don't cry, remember?
Jill Haynes, Jill Haynes, I've told you about Jill a hundred times, Lester, you never remember anything I say.
Jesus, she's my best friend.
I can talk about whoever the fuck I want! You won't even remember what I say! I can tell you that your wife was a fucking whore and we can still be friends!
Not what you'd call rich. Makes about five thousand a year.
Bermuda.
A journalist! Peeking through keyholes -- running after fire engines -- waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them if they think Hitler's going to start a war -- stealing pictures off old ladies of their daughters that got chased by apemen! I know all about reporters -- a lot of daffy buttinskies going around without a nickel in their pockets, and for what? So a million hired girls and motormen's wives will know what's going on! No, Walter, I'm through.
It's a good, honest business, isn't it?
Bullshit, Nick. And don't tell me this is all just about Charlie. It's not.
You'll get Ich killed.
He's okay. They sobered him up.
Wouldn't help. Watch out for Ich.
Wait a minute. I want you to get out the car. You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person.
Who?
Great.
One of the plagues on members of Congress--office-seekers, cranks, people with pet bills. Get my son into West Point--or outta West Point. I've got a scheme to put people to work. How do I get rid of cockroaches? Some woman's composed a hymn to replace the Star Spangled Banner. Want to hear it?
Uchh! Look at me?! I'm like so ... pasty!
This tastes weird. Harley? It's me. I need your services. Translate that anyway you'd like. I'm at-
I'm glad of it, honey.
Who is it?
Who is it?
Who from work?
Is it for a child?
Then who's it for?
So you never knew your mother?
If you don't quit it, Will, I'm leaving.
Excuse me, what about the job?
Nope.
Ail right. By the way, his friend...?
He doesn't like you. Thank you for answering my question.
No idea.
Oh. I see.
What the hell happened to you?
Well. I don't really know where to start.
Your hair's different.
Everything's different.
I don't do dates. But I don't lose either, so you're on.
Yeah. Whose gonna notify his next of kin?
I'm still here, aren't I? I may as well enjoy myself. I'm going to go to school today. Dad, I want to apologize for yesterday. The car is a classic. Use it in the best of health.
Right. Open your eyes, James. You don't know me. Even Donna doesn't know me. Your Laura disappeared... It's just me now.
Bobby killed a guy.
You want to see...
Shit, maybe he'll kill you.
When he finds out.
Why not?
I know, but - well, how do you establish that, sir? Are the cars, uh, counted daily or what kind of -
... I'm sorry, sir?
but do you know that for sure without -
Are you coming to see us. Miss Callahan?
That means I can go alone?
You're going to be busy all day long, Edward.
As soon as I can walk.
Miss.
Baxter.
I mean -- her apartment.
No -- it's my stomach.
I know you don't think much of being needed, or of me for that matter...
This came for you a couple of days ago. Olive asked me to bring it. With everything happening, I guess she forgot.
No, I'm the one who should be sorry. You have every right to be angry.
What will you do, Colonel?
Very smart indeed.
Mr. Treves, some more books arrived for Mr. Merrick.
Yes sir. What's that?
Is he not back yet?
It's far too late for him to still be out.
How was it?
What'd ya see?
Oh, are you? Does she know that?
You don't mind that I'm not coming tonight?
Does it happen to all men?
No.
I'm aware of that. We don't have to turn this into a big deal. Okay? We don't have to have a fight. It was important to me. But forget it. Just something I wanted to do for myself.
Yeah, so what do you guys do next? I mean, what's your band do now?
Was I? I'm sorry.
Would you pick one out, please?
Do you think there's somebody out there you could love as much as your wife? Maybe even more?
What are you going to do, Sam?
What was it that made you know?
Okay? And you're embarrassing me. Why do want to make me feel so bad?
I'm not sure . . . but it's proving to be very popular!
They're waiting. Come on.
He'll win.
Well... I'll give it a try, Mr. York.
Good. That was good. Where do I go?
You didn't say what it was for, did you?
Who did it?
Is that how you answer the phone?
And what's the mysterious code word?
And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
'Night Miss Jenny; don't let the bedbugs bite.
I love songs about extraterrestrial life, don't you?
Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
He's just been for a walk.
What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this?
Sure.
Sure.
It was very nice meeting you, Mrs. Pilletti. I hope I'll see you again.
Goodnight.
Sure.
Goodnight, Mrs. Pilletti.
Bobby...
Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
Not tonight. Just give me something to take home to hold me over till tomorrow.
No boyfriend of mine is going to walk around in negative-five degree wind chill without a goddamn good- looking coat!
You got out, Nick. You're here. You're my Christmas.
Fifty percent off, motherfucker. Ho ho ho.
Well, I'm definitely seventeen and now definitely late--
What do people do in the afternoon?
The hat business is in trouble.
My father can't get our money from the bank. We have a few dol...
How are you doing?
I wish I could.
No. I was alone. My sister Jenny was sick and stayed home that day.
About eight-thirty in the morning.
Yes.
Yes.
But when John F. Kennedy's elected President, men'1l stop wearing hats.
Do you dream?
I'm Meredith, by the way. Meredith Randall.
You're not the Shipping Greenleaf's?
Hello.
What's your secret?
No, it's just -- you are American, aren't you? -- no, I just, I have so much luggage, and you're so, uh, streamlined. It's humiliating.
So now, did they put your suitcase in the wrong pile? It's just -- upstairs -- weren't you under the R stand? I thought I saw you there.
But Jabez, I never said that!
Yes?
What is your name?
You celebrate, Jerome?
Let go...
I don't love ya no more.
Laz... You can't say nothin'...
Very.
Walt!
About what!
May the Lord have mercy on you, Walt Spoon!
No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before...
... and It's just... well, deja vu.
I have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone.
Fabrizio said you might be up --
If you don't mind I think I'll stay at the hotel.
I'm a little tired.
I know.
I don't need them anymore...
You a doctor, too?
I'm very sad but Richard said that since it's Cary Grant, he completely understands. I'm also taking Mrs. Delaney away from this town. She'll be living with Cary and I in Beverly Hills.
Did you ever stop to think that maybe that isn't science's fault, but meaning's?
I read your book.
Losing Faith: The Search For Meaning In the Age of Reason. Catchy.
I'm more interested in the story behind the story... How a young man goes from living on the streets of South Boston to being the best- selling media figure rubbing elbows with the President.
I thought it was well-written. Heart-felt. And a little bit naive... But that's just the enemy's perspective.
Want to join me?
It's because I don't trust myself with you. I took a vow and because of you I'm tempted to break it. Don't destroy that for me. Please.
You really want to know?
Am I suppose to be this sore?
In case of what?
No, but he's looking after the money, so what's the problem?
He's in trouble, all right. But I don't have any idea what it is.
Can't we call someone? Admiral Lazarro?
Is the baby okay?
And I also agreed with what you said today about Marcus's story. It is a piece of shit.
Juno! God, you startled me. What are you doing here? What's wrong?
So.
Ramona! Ramona!
Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got to sit down first and write it up. The where, when, why, how--and everything else. That takes time--
I see. This one is so simple--
Oh, yes. And I'm helping. Simple-- and I'm helping. So we knock this off in record-breaking time of--let's say three or four days--
A day !
Tonight. Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be complaining, Senator--but in all civilized countries, there's an institution called dinner --!
On the other hand - I am the publisher of the Enquirer. As such, it is my duty - I'll let you in on a little secret, it is also my pleasure - to see to it that decent, hard-working people of this city are not robbed blind by a group of money- mad pirates because, God help them, they have no one to look after their interests! I'll let you in on another little secret, Mr. Thatcher. I think I'm the man to do it. You see, I have money and property -
The trouble is, Mr. Thatcher, you don't realize you're talking to two people.
As Charles Foster Kane, who has eighty- two thousand, six hundred and thirty-one shares of Metropolitan Transfer - you see, I do have a rough idea of my holdings - I sympathize with you. Charles Foster Kane is a dangerous scoundrel, his paper should be run out of town and a committee should be formed to boycott him. You may, if you can form such a committee, put me down for a contribution of one thousand dollars.
You're right. We did lose a million dollars last year.
Reel it in. He's only tiny, throw him back.
Big deal, I can do that too. Thomas J, you got something!
Maybe they had a big breakfast.
Don't swear...
Italian is practically the same thing.
Maybe soon--
We can prove that you're not Ray Dunbar. Impersonating a fellow Cadet is a court-martial in and of itself --
He's so fuckin' lucky. I could have buried him. I could have gone to Europe and taken the baby. And then he'd've tracked me down and he'd've killed me.
...Oh, come on! You think the same thing!
But what do I say?
Yes. Might. Remember, you're here to talk to my mother.
There's money in it, Cooley.
Cooley, I want to talk to you.
He was a kind little man in his way and I made him go down that hall into the darkness. I made him do it.
Something they... that they overlooked.
I saw him on the floor. He was cut - --here. The blood was running out. He was dead. I'm sure of it. Then on the subway I saw him white and the men holding him up between them.
But you do believe me?
... But I've never done... ... You mean...? When... When... When I do it? ... When I touch myself...?
... Is that all you want...? ... To watch me...?
Larry there's got to be something missing.
Huh?
Yeah, well, like I said, it didn't figure. You two.
Terrific. I'm doing vegetables next week.
Yeah.
I'm your Goddamn wife. Once you vowed to cherish me forever. Now you hold a gun to my head?
John said something about him being set up because he "found out about her."
Lamar, do you know the reason why John came here to work with you?
But now we've lost access to Craig.
Were you with Jamie?
A late night or an early morning?
Here. Why am I looking at this star?
You sleeping with her?
And here is one of Frederick's mother.
Get up, Billy.
Fill her up. There's a phone right over there.
...I always thought so...
Cal, stop! It was an accident.
Hello. Nice to meet you. Please call me Peggy. I'm Peggy Bodell now.
Okay. Let's assume he wanted you to find him, that some part of him hated what he was doing... Most likely, that part is dead. Schizophrenics with Whalen's Infraction sever all ties with the real world. I'm sorry, I really am.
Really? I don't work with violent cases, I work with children. But even a kid lies. They love it when they get you to believe something that isn't true. Don't you think Stargher would do the same?
What if he wasn't like this? What if he was "normal?" Conscious. How far would you go?
Yes, Mr. Selectman!
The Grammys. He's got a lotta records up for awards.
I'm late.
If you must know, it's a hectic time for Tony. The Grammys are tonight.
Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared.
Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more?
You know, Ma, why the Squire came to see Jabez?
My God, I wear the same scent as a transvestite. She IS a transvestite, isn't: she?
Yes.
...You-you spoke to him?
Where are they?
The sex is better.
With you there's a tragic dimension.
...No... he's my lover...
Who have you been talking to?
What makes you think they were lesbians, or as you so quaintly put it, dykes?
It might pay to reexamine a few of your more primitive notions. I was in bed with a girlfriend watching TV last week, Jack, and one thing we know about me is I happen not to be a lesbian ... Now, if this Indian's girlfriend got upset when you came looking for him, it could just be she's still vulnerable to him.
How is it any different?
Mine.
I guess you think that I talked you into something, huh?
That's right, and it's got bad plumbing and bugs.
You don't want me to live with you?
I'm not your daughter.
Aren't you the cool guy?
-- The inside?
Who are you?!
I don't blame you... This is a monumental first day out... You sad or anything?
Really?
What?
Quite a while... an hour, an hour and a half -- sometimes forty-five minutes -- that's quite a while, isn't It?
Hi Dad.
Well yes -- you know that about George.
It's been so long I don't how long?
Well... it's not so much the number of times he does it, it's... he does it for a long time.
He does?
I think you're going to hit that car in front of us.
-- See, I just know that if I go to Egypt, well, things happen, I just don't know what'll happen to us, he just never seems to think ahead, does he?
I'll be right back.
Is that a cellar door?
There's nothing to hear -- I haven't done anything. And why haven't I done anything? Because none of you will listen to me!!
"Although advised of risks, all personnel elect to remain down for duration of storm to continue investigation of alien sphere and associated spacecraft. Signed, Barnes, USN."
Jabez!
Don't they believe in signs here?
I know, I know.
Who's "we"?
That's what I hear.
I don't know if there's any single reason. But my father was Navy. And he had this old-time recruiting poster in his den. It showed a girl trying on a sailor's uniform while saying, "Gee, I wish I were a man! I'd join the Navy!" Was maybe 10 years old when I first saw it, and even then it felt wrong. Made me mad. And I don't think a month has gone by that I haven't thought about that poster. "Gee, I wish I were a man."
This was my very first slow dance.
How you doin'?
My medication. I left it back there.
Well, how do I find out what kind of chromium is up in Hinkley?
Who are they?
You can't describe him at all? Don't you think that's find of odd?
I don't know whether to look for a midget or a --
Okay. So he was tall?
Win?
Our doctor's gone too.
How'd you get this?
Wait, let me look at that... You better come in here.
Sing a song of sixpence...
I read the letter. You read the will. He wants you to keep it. To live in it some day.
There's more than one kind?
It is cocktail hour yet?
Harmful, like -- how? What would you get?
So that stuff -- it kills people.
What? She asked about my father?
You're sure about this?
I'm not the one who has to have three scotches just to walk in the door and say hello.
It's when the heat is so bad, dogs go crazy.
No. I think the house is empty. I can't invite you in because I'm married and because I know who I am. You're shaking.
I remember. You were indelicate, indiscreet and entirely less than tactful... Sound like anyone you know?
Why don't you come back with me?
So, if I win it's because deep down you know you're about to make the biggest mistake of your life, and deep down your want me to stop you.
Oh, no... please... not here. It looks too dangerous.
What is that one over there called?
Sounds like the name of a fish -- merluzzo, basiluzzo...
Fine.
And I'll want to leave an early wake-up call.
Sounds perfect. I can park my car back there?
I'm sorry. The fire's gone out.
Forget it? I chop wood for the stove five times a day. Every time I remember. I remember that across the tracks the Anglo miners have hot water in pipes. And bathrooms. Inside.
But for what reason should I come there?
They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken.
Do you got something for me?
You betcha.
I put a little cherry on top. You're right. What the hell he ever do for us?
Thanks.
Now be careful with that bag. You don't want it ripping open on you in the middle of the store.
I'm sorry, I just decided to stay in the suit -- get out of that damn uniform.
Sir, a ring my lady bid me give you.
No. I'm really a brunette, but the rest is me. And that's all the news that's fit to print.
He takes a cut of our earnings and invests it for us. He makes us quit the life at thirty. He doesn't let us use narcotics and he doesn't abuse us. Can your policeman's mentality grasp those contradictions?
Colored.
Really! That's wonderful.
You're a little boy and you like to be bad.
All our friends...
No.
No, Calvin, you're favorite.
I'm not hungry.
What do you mean by that?
Why not?
Yes?
What do you mean by that?
What would you think of me if -
Only two steps back? Even the man they left to guard me retreated further than that.
I'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?
It's that jerk Walter.
What happened?
It means I care about you and what happens to you.
I know there is. And you're what I have to bargain with. For now you're the last one in their way.
Break a leg.
Ma! Stop! What do you want me to do?
Y-you mentioned to me yourself that you and Elliot were having some problems.
Do we need words?
We're neighbors now. You can call me Sarah.
For whom and for what?
You know what's good for him?
You didn't answer my first question. For whom?
I don't...I don't want to bother everyone.
If my sister's in that room, it won't make any difference about warrants- and things, I want to go there.
Why would Mrs. Redi lie to me?
Yes. She bought my sister's business.
Can we go there now?
You think my sister is there?
Well, I feel kind of like an animal living out here. I mean, there's no place to bathe and... no place to get anything good to eat.
That's Montana over there.
If you're deaf, read my lips...I don't need a psycho following me today.
I'm too old for you.
Looks old.
Wow.
I guess it's getting serious.
That's what the swing is there for...
You know that the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?
Go on...
How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?
Why?
Transitioned?
Why not?
But I don't know anything about programming.
Oh, he's... he drifted off. He'll sleep for a while now. What is it you have to do, exactly?
It's alright, Barton. You don't have to write actual scenes?
Yes, I'm afraid I have.
Well, usually, they're... simply morality tales. There's a good wrestler, and a bad wrestler whom he confronts at the end. In between, the good wrestler has a love interest or a child he has to protect. Bill would usually make the good wrestler a backwoods type, or a convict. And sometimes, instead of a waif, he'd have the wrestler protecting an idiot manchild. The studio always hated that. Oh, some of the scripts were so... spirited!
And don't make any noise.
That's a lie! They want me, they want me! I get letters every day!
The truth was, that no matter how bad I felt, I was still very attracted to him. Why should I give him up to someone else? Why should she win?
...Goodnight, Rocky.
Wanted what?
You look terrible. What happened? Jake ... is it the antidote?
Jake, what is it?
You can have anything you want.
Look at yourself. You look like you've seen a ghost.
When I have something to say.
He is.
Yes.
Thinks he is. Well, he is.
Won't mother be proud.
No.
Where do you think babies come from?
What do you mean?
Nothing. I do remember the car crash... I told you... I remember the glass ... I think about that sometimes ... I remember walking here, sort of. Now I remember this place and you. That's about it.
Hey Rob, what's going on?
Can we get a doctor at that ranch?
Do you remember what just happened?
Frightened.
NO... no... I said leave her alone.
Stop this, she'll hurt herself I'm not going to allow this.
No... don't hit me please...
Is someone in the room with you?
That's good. Do you feel well enough to stand?
Yes.
Can you climb back up.
You don't think the guy would find me attractive enough to dance with?
Mike...
Well... This is it.
I'm not sure we can afford to have the "appearance" of a war.
No wonder you're so popular.
So am I.
Oh, they weren't that bad. I mean, they were kind of cute.
What do you do when you work?
glows with pride. STEVE is emptying his pockets on the bench. HONORA pats STEVE's hand.
Not so long--just once around the sun.
Sure you are. You're just a happier woman, cause you don't have to deal with maxi-pads and underwire.
Where does that name come from?
It's not your given name, right?
And you went to Van Nuys High, right?
Bastard, sneak, quitter.
I just found out. You didn't say anything to me? You just resign? Will you meet me now? -- No, now! I'm going away tomorrow. Please.
You don't think you'll go --
So you must travel a lot with all that pudding you bought?
...yeah...
I'll be around and back in town in a few days --
If you come to Hawaii --
Was it funny?
Did you do that when you were a kid?
Yeah. It's stupid.
You know.
Why do they do that?
YES YOU DO, DONNA. What a downer you are!!!
Oh, come on. What is he? Fifteen?
Sixteen.
I left a message. I've been dealing with that real estate thing. I was gonna write up a whole damn report and --
You're sure?
You're on your own, understand?
But you do exist. Narcissus: hero of the battle of the Danube.
It's too neat.
I just... He came back for Kendall. I don't think he's capable of murder.
Look, all we've got is what Kendall says, and he didn't actually witness any deaths except Nunez. He found West, he saw Mueller and Pike, but just their bodies -- he didn't see any crime committed.
I wish you could have told me yourself. Oh, Grace, it's not for long. They say it'll be over by Christmas.
You joined up.
Has Sue got it right?
What did you do in Asia? Is that where you met the man with cigarettes?
So how come you know so much about those countries?

It must be difficult having lots of wives.
Stand by the door.
How's it feel, Tommy?
When will you do it?
Is that all?
Yes.
Tell me about it.
How about in the morning.
I thought I'd stay the night.
Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
Did I say something wrong?
I mean...things. Ted, Joanna's very unhappy and--
You're doing the right thing, Mr. Masry.
Out some place.
Oh, she was here.
I never said I wasn't upset. Of course I'm upset. I miss her terribly. But I know what I saw and what I heard...and it wasn't some "symptom" of something...
Who is thin?
I don't know who you are.
Hello.
Always on my ass, anyway.
Yes, you have a suit I've had my eye on.
Let's just go home, okay?
Caesar wants me to stay.
You don't need to do that.
I don't mind...
Relax. You've done enough.
I COME IN HERE - YOU DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOW WHO THE FUCK I AM OR WHAT MY LIFE IS AND YOU HAVE THE FUCKING BALLS, THE INDECENCY TO ASK ME A QUESTION ABOUT MY LIFE --
This is one big house for one single person.
How are you gonna get the money for this old house if you're not working?
What do you get for that?
No. Well, guess i'll go home and finish off War amp; Peace.
And is this guy from chumpsville?! I pulled the old mother routine --
Lumbago.
Where do you meet?
Disease? What disease?
Nobody reads that stuff anymore.
That's what I mean.
I know. It's okay.
Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M Ms. Hope you're ready.
All right.
Here. Ti amo.
Stop tripping.
Say my name.
Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked.
Hello, my little boy.
You remind me so much of Nathan.
He's completely innocent.
No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
Does he do this all the time?
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
Bob is real. He's been "having" me since I was 12.
The diary was hidden too well. He's the only one who could know where it was. He's getting to know me, now. He's real. He speaks to me.
Bob.
My secret diary. There are pages missing.
Hi... am I late?
Where's Dad?
I hate asparagus.
If it's okay with you I'm going to Bobby's to do my homework.
Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
No.
I just have this talent for falling in love with the wrong guy in the wrong place at the wrong time. BUD How many guys were there?
Three. The last one was manager of a finance company, back home in Pittsburgh -- they found a little shortage in his accounts, but he asked me to wait for him -- he'll be out in 1965.
That's me with men. I've been jinxed from the word go -- first time I was ever kissed was in a cemetery.
I was fifteen -- we used to go there to smoke. His name was George -- he threw me over for a drum majorette.
Ruined -- all the fields -- ruined.
So I came to New York and moved in with my sister and her husband -- he drives a cab. They sent me to secretarial school, and I applied for a job with Consolidated - but I flunked the typing test --
Aldys, don't miss your prom--it only happens once.
Southglen South competes every year for best prom, and usually they win. We Denominators don't even go to prom. -But to everyone else it's huge.
What is with this school and prom?
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
I loved your chemist, Jake. The height of fantasy. And your vision of paradise. A most romantic creation. You're quite a dreamer, Jake. Only it's time to wake up.
Where's Ma?
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You know who I am.
You sure?
Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror.
The Wizard of Gore?
Do you live together?
This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark.
Not every day?
Harry? Oh Harry, I knew you'd come. I love you, Harry. I love... Take me home, Harry.
No, Louise, you said the first part. I said all the rest.
I said all that?
Whatever.
Nobody would believe us. We'd still get in trouble. We'd still have our lives ruined. And you know what else?
What'd I say again?
That guy was hurtin' me. And if you hadn't come out when you did, he'd a hurt me a lot worse. And probably nothin' woulda happened to him. 'Cause everybody did see me dancin' with him all night. And they woulda made out like I asked for it. And my life woulda been ruined a whole lot worse than it is now. At least now I'm havin' fun. And I'm not sorry the son of a bitch is dead. I'm only sorry that it was you that did it and not me. And if I haven't, I wanna take this time to thank you, Louise. Thank you for savin' my ass.
What?
Yes.
Shut the door, shut the door!
Have you succeeded in your task?
I hate when things don't go my way. It makes me so horny.
Thank you. Mmmm, that feels good.
Well, let me know when you do. Until then.
No.
I don't remember.
That's what you think.
Why? Who are you?
We better make it, or Sport'll get mad. How do you want to make it?
I got used to...thinking of them. As...my kids too.
You must learn magic.
Then I will teach you.
Who?
You think this is all very funny.
Then let him talks to me. We don't need you to solve our prob...
Is it funny that I'm in love with you?
You have forgotten my last name?
I have to talk to you. It's very important.
George, I went to the doctor. I don't have two years.
Two years. George, I can't wait that long.
Congratulations on the math contest, Richard.
Oh, I'm sorry, Gus! My foot must have slipped.
I'm not gonna quit cause of one creepy phone call, George.
In fact, I don't think I've ever been to a beauty parlor in my whole life.
Because... I have to be alone!
I hadn't thought about it.
No! YOU get in the kitchen. I'm gonna make you dry my dishes!
Ron...Ronny, you know you do have to go on in twenty-five minutes.
Yeah, I saw 'em. Poor guys.
Go the fuck away, Rosie.
Rose, please go away.
How'd you know where I was?
Your brother should have his license revoked.
Why didn't your brother tell you that Nathan was having an affair?
Friends and colleagues.
He made you give him a blow job.
Well... not exactly.
Well what then?
No.
Why didn't you do something?
If she knew, she'd kill me. It happened at your house last night.
So, let me get this straight. You came over to our house late last night and he forced intercourse on you.
I don't know.
Cecile, I think you're going to have a hard time crying rape if that's all he did.
If that's what you call it.
No. But you're close.
A rooster?
Later when?
Where's your dad?
At one in the morning?
No. I shall be out walking.
Mantids can mimic. We gave the Judas that code...
Mmm.
You don't have any fucking money..
Nope.
Greetings, Charles.
Yup.
So it's you he was after!
It's okay with me, hi Kevin.
You might have mentioned me first.
Assuming the baby's a quot;Supremes quot; fan.
I don't know. Maybe a hotel.
What who's saying?
I don't know if I want to stay here. I don't feel safe.
I...
It's for your finger.
Oh.
Who is that...?
That's all talk. He's got nothing on us. He let you kill Jake.
The Historical Society wanted this and I never would give it to them --
Granny's dress. Oh, Mom.
Is that all right with you?
We... won?!
Gee, thanks a lot.
Why didn't you turn on the light?
He deserves a show. He missed the movie.
Why don't you arrest that man? Are you protecting him because policeman?
Are you serious.
So what's the deal. You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces. Is that what this is about.
In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren?
Right.
...Anything else?
Anita!
Thank you. Thank you so much.
It claims to restore monthly regularity.
You done?
It isn't any better.
I work at Seligman's.
Yeah, we have Mr. Morris Levine's eightieth birthday party on Riverside Drive...or Riverside Memorial Chapel, depending on his health.
Oh, I'm just glad we have a catering job this week. I'm real low on money.
What?
You're joking.
Uh, David called me last night, and he wants to take me to the opera. I didn't know what to say.
I, uh, I'm very surprised.
No, he called late last night.
Yeah well wait till mom opens her mouth.
Well, associating with criminals, if you're the one they talked to, that right there would be a violation of your parole and would end with you back in Stillwater.
What do you see?
Was there ever a girl who didn't like fighter pilots?
And on to a bigger one with you?
How so?
That's a big comfort to me.
It isn't?
Yes. But it's closed all the time now, because of the blackout.
Wally said to say, "Hello."
You've seen only one movie? Which one?
Peggy! What's the matter? Who is it?
I know where we could get the money. A lot more than one-hundred-fifty dollars.
Like you ll find a way to stop your Austrian killing you a second time round?
No answer. You have no passport and your Embassy s out. How do you plan to leave the U.S., Mr Lombard?
How come you re alive? Child traffickers usually achieve what they set out to do. What am I really looking at here, huh? Are you really not just a lousy private eye? Am I really looking at some kind of cunning dispenser of justice in disguise?
Whitney Armstrong, my deputy. What Whitney s trying to say is that you might not live to tell the tale next time you meet your Austrian...
Take me with you.
Please. I won't hang on you. As soon as we get there you can dump me. I don't care. I just want to get out of here.
You bet you are.
To tell you the truth...I'm excited.
Not the focus.
We did.
To get my life back. To have some time for myself. Some time for us.
He doesn't give it to us. We take it.
We must go on home, Jabez.
-- I'm going to try, Mr. Webster.
This is Monica and Ryan. Mac and Clair.
No.
Damn it, Norman. I swear. I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up.
You think it's me? You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't?
No, it wasn't. I swear none of this was here. None of it. You think he hid it? Earlier. He must've hid it.
You don't believe me.
Damn it, Norman! He's lying. Don't you get it? There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it. Why can't you believe me?
Hidden. Where my brother cannot place hands on them. He didn't have the guts to watch them die so... I took care of it all. The sooner he is put out of our misery, the sooner will they be safe.
You cannot die.
Marcus would have lived but... was poisoned by his son.
Narcissus, I have your family. They're alive. All of them.
Perks? Jesus -- perks?
Bullshit. You stuck me in Siberia dictating to some God damn steno clerk so you could finish this thing without me. After all I've done for you, that's the thanks I get.
God damn it, Matthew. What the hell are you doing out here?
I know the winemaker. She comes in the restaurant all the time.
I know. I love that.
Try it.
Twelve months in oak.
How bad is it?
So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
You're not tired of it?
Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. "Oh, I'd say there's fifty thousand here. What would you say?" But all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to Customs, and I could tell they didn't want to do that.
How much?
Yeah, I know you have to work the whole time, I'll probably have more fun here. I'll call Charlie and those guys.
Are you sure you have to go?
I miss you.
Oh, hi.
Doesn't matter. I... I don't want to come back, that's all.
You said all the passengers were accounted for...
Just thinking out loud.
He does. Could we have a table close to him?
Feels good.
What?
I made no request to go out riding today. How long has he been there?
Then what is he?
Don't you feel there are different sides to every personality? Maybe even the worst of us is capable of one decent act. We're all human.
Not Stargher, not really. He's split himself right down the middle. Good evil, right wrong, merciful cruel. A monster. And an innocent child. If I could reach the boy.
He might tell me about Julia. The part of him that wants to help, that feels shame and remorse. Who wants to be redeemed.
This is going to sound terrible, but... I don't think she matters anymore. Not to him. He never finished her. The others...he was able to make them his.
What?
I don't think so. Not yet anyway. And besides, something like that doesn't make you a bad person. He reminds me of Steve in a way. Steve's weak, immoral and a liar but he's still a real nice guy. He just shouldn't be married. At least not to me. You getting hungry? I'm hungry.
Oh, he did not. He's such a nice guy.
Oh, don't feel sorry for me. Please. No one's forcing me to stay.
How's everything?
So do you.
Oh, I miss you. You look beautiful.
What do you mean?
Hi. Um, there doesn't seem to be any hotel room available and someone told me to come here and ask for "Tubab" who might to have a place for me to stay. Are you "Tubab"?
A very short while, Uncle. I've been given permission to stay only a few days.
Barber was my next stop, sir. Would've had it regulation sooner, only --
Sid Worley, I think you're ashamed of me.
Thank you, sir.
If you won't take me to dinner with your parents, I won't meet you at the motel.
Thank you, sir. But I expect a certain amount of pain.
Pleased to meet you.
It's all right, Chet.
Jon, it's the tenth. I know how difficult it is for you, but we still have to go.
Johnny!
She's been stalking you, Peter.
Honey, you're exhausted. Do you want to lie down for a little while?
We're still going to be together.
Listen to me, I love you, Peter, I'm trying to protect you!
If you weren't at least the 300th person to ask me that, I'd probably be pissed. Boy, you sure know it's a man's world sometimes...
You leave me so--so without-- without dignity.
Yeah.
It's nothing. This is New York, man... Oh -- I forgot. Bowtay needs some cash to buy her new acting headshots out of the developers. It's a good investment, man. She could make serious money!
What do you think?
I didn't ask for any help. Did you, Linda?
I think they're both virgins.
No.
O-kay, you guys can come swimming. But you have to leave as soon as my Mom gets home. Okay?
It's just Linda. And Mark from school.
I went out on the boat.
Of course.
Brian?
You know this is gonna be my first 4th of July picnic in a long time.
Sorry.
Forgive me. How are you?
Well, your business must not be sports memorabilia, because this one Mantle card right here-- --is worth six thousand dollars all by its little self.
No, you get out of here.
Are you French?
Oh, I was a very late developer, they used to call me quot;Shelly Two Backs quot;. All my friends had real bra's, not like the training ones I had.
No.
Yeah.
Why did you go?
I mean, I'm not much use anymore. Why can't they be compassionate to me?
How was the dinner?
Long enough for you to pretty much read me like a book, right?
And back at ya. Only there's a part of you that's... I don't know--
Where?
Dad.. it's not a big deal. Didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?
At my age? Don't be silly.
Hide me? Why?
I-shan't see her. No, Barbara, no.
There's another promise you must make me. That little girl who comes here...she mustn't ever come to see you again. Promise me you won't see her.
Good night...Barbara...
Good night, mother, good night.
I'll not see her, Barbara. I promise.
Wherever they're going, I'm going.
Yes.
I don't want to see you killed. I want to live with you. Live with you. Any place it's safe to walk the streets without... .
Terry, no, no... .
...I don't know what happened to Big Dave. I know some of it. Irregularities in my books, they said. Can I explain it.
Well, good night, then...
Are you mad! Why are you doing this! We're so close, the town is going to be ours. Don't throw away your future Bud!
Don't be so sure.
Gus I, the popular kids and I, we just don't- I mean, I don't think I can do this.
Fair enough.
I'm not selling anything. Your son called and asked for advice on how to find you a new wife.
I didn't. You asked me about the card. You're going to get us into trouble.
Damn.
You, me and Harry. He's asleep.
It's also our only way out of here! It holds three people. And there's only three of us left now.
Maybe you should go. To the sub.
Get the helium out of our bloodstream. We go to the surface now, we'd pop like a soda bottle.
You should know how it works. Just in case.
Chris!
I know.
I'll get some.
Don't mind what she says, Chris.
I couldn't go near that woman.
I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
I had to. I was frantic. I didn't know what to do.
I need an antihistamine. Mom thinks she's feeling her asthma, and so...
Oh, my God. Thank you.
Aah... Hey, have you tried Holly and her friend's shrimp puffs?
You've outdone yourself.
I think they're fantastic.
I swear. I swear. We've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.
Are we talking about cocaine again?
I never took pleasure in hurting anyone?
If I didn't, I wouldn't put you through it.
I don't care.
Yes, but important people are concerned about this. Judge Hillier spoke to Alma Styles --
It isn't in your hands, Mama. It's my life.
Of course.
What do I do, Dad?
...You will.
Don't be soft.
Over... my... dead... body!
Are you human beings or are you some kind of male monsters? Is there no limit to which you won't go to keep your illusions about yourselves?
I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man?
I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got?
Maybe she is.
Oh, but they can!
Italian.
A few teeth... that's the price of his life?
All right. All right. I'm taking a break at four o'clock. If you're here then we'll go to the corner and have some coffee and pie.
I put blueberries in them just the way you like.
Yes?
Thank you, Travis.
We've signed up 15,000 Palantine volunteers in New York so far. The organizational problems are becoming just staggering.
I mean, among other things, that it must have been a revelation to have your twenty-four-year-old character played by twenty-four-year-old actress...
Thanks.
Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please.
Just what is it you think I can do for you?
You have three minutes to tell me what you're doing here before I feed you to a few of my more predacious plants.
And how would I know that?
'Nita, this is about reporting, not accessorizing.
Cuuuute!
Anita!
And we're going to have to do something about your hair.
Jos, please try and have some fun here, okay? How many of us get to go back to high school? You're gonna have a blast!
Why don't you see Lester?
Sorry, comb got caught.
Yeah, me too.
I know, Mother Sister, but I'm here now. Where's the stuff?
This might take some time.
Geoffrey's not in Cairo. He's not actually a buffoon. And the plane wasn't a wedding present. It belongs to the British Government. They want aerial maps of the whole North Africa. So I think he's in Ethiopia. In case you were counting on his sudden appearance.
People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
Hey, I thought you weren't a buffet person.
I am who I am. I can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are. I like sex different -- I like it wild. That's not a crime. I loved Andrew. We made love together. We made it differently, but we still made love. It was our way. It was private -- and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice. If I was some middle-aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?
That's ridiculous.
Andrew hardly needed leading. He was a very passionate man. He was eager to explore. I gave him what he wanted. We fulfilled each others needs.
I'm used to being on the outside looking in. The same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.
No, your going to eat it, or it will go to waste.
Jack.
Well it's fixed, so you'll have to eat it.
Look, I just wanted to say, I think it's great you're riding again. And... and I think I know why you, you needed to do it alone... without anyone knowing...
Yeah, you know everything!!
I was just trying to say thank you to Diane and Frank and --
Tom?
Grace, I don't hate your father.
I can't remember the last time you made him dinner.
What are you talking about?
You... not wanting to go home because you hate daddy so much.
STOP IT! Why can't I talk to you!!
NO, YOU STOP IT! Stop pretending like you care! Like this really isn't about you and Tom.
It's all here.
John, don't be mad! Don't be mad! I was just playing with it! I didn't tell no one!
You'll get awful mad, John. I done a Sin!
I've got a lot of medicine in me, sweetie. And I'm a little wobbly for driving or running ar...
How about I pick one out for you?
I don't know. I just want to try it.
That's fine, honey. Now, get out!
Then what happened?
Help cook?
What?
Oh my God... You're blushing.
Italian?
Why you left.
They're elite! Let's get 'em.
Twenty-two years ago.
Because my real father wouldn't marry her.
Call me during the week if you get the chance.
-- still -- at least we should tell him we're going. C'mon.
We can't really leave that poor man here alone.
Not who, food. Should we get Italian.
...where?
You were in Africa?
Bonjour.
What do you want?
You'd never understand.
So was my Patient.
You go.
I'm not doing this until I speak with Gus.
You think it's ok where I left it, right there?
How long does it last? Oh.
Well - if she's got to pick on someone, I'd just as soon it was me.
-- who's married to --
If I thought I'd offended her, of all people-
Eve. I'm fond of Margo too. But I know Margo. And every now and then there is nothing I want to do so much as to kick her right square in the pants.
Oh you bet. Will you excuse me for a sec?
Oh, gosh no.
Karen... ... you won't forget, will you? What we talked about before?
Paul! Then another voice.
How about I pick one out for you?
Got any requests?
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?
Don't do it, Norman!
Ask them to sit down.
Are they standing for me?
Thank you, Mr Carter. This is Mr. Leland.
They would have killed you too.
You don't remember me..... I'm Dorothy Wynant.
My God!
Where are you going?
I have to go. He sighs.
I have to go.
I brought you Haagen Dazs. Chocolate.
Andy... there is no real you.
Dr. Judd?
You know where she is?
So I'm going to get some sleep. I'm glad you're okay.
Cloven hoof?
Okay, Joel. I suppose you're right.
Never heard of him.
Can't you tell when somebody's hittin' on you?
Who is it?
I wonder if Jimmy's gotten back.
Oh -- Mr. Webster -- I'm so glad you came!
Are you having an affair?
Well, are you?
Yes, exactly. Exactly my point.
If I'm right, I want to know. I don't want you to lie. I'd be very upset, but not as upset as if I'd found out you'd been lying.
I can't tell you how upset I would be if you were lying.
Come up and see me... now.
But you weren't. I could tell.
So what. Infatuation is good, too.
Sure--sure. He must have a compass with him.
Sure.
Yes. The ghost.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
This is Dorsia?
I thought I would need it.
No, I mean you, right now. Not it you were somebody else.
Are we here?
He tries to act cool.
What about you Max?
That tape sucked, by the way!
You're avoiding the question.
I thought all good generals were quick to recognize opportunities.
Without him. He'd be weeping if he overheard that. Well? The idea of you as my adopted brother is very... exciting.
I'm gonna go now.
Get off of me! Stop it!
Let go of me! Let go of me!
That's puttin' it mildly.
Louise and Darryl don't get along.
He's got a lot to be proud of.
Darryl, that's my husband, he says he's not ready. He's still too much of a kid himself. He prides himself on being infantile.
He's a real piece o' work. I wish you could meet him.
She thinks he's a pig.
When I twisted hair like this it means I'm intimidated by you...
Yes?
Jackie?
Not great. Plus, I've got things on my mind. You know.
You feeling all right?
I really don't know what to say
Wowie. How wonderful!
...thinking of going back to Random House. On a part-time basis.
A triumph. When did you get here?
You've got Cal. You've got Gina. You've got Skye? We're the leftovers.
Dinner. Don't be angry.
Truce?
My husband.
Sam, let's go get married.
I haven't even been married once yet!
I'm thinking of it.
Don't miss your plane.
I recall you.
...from Mavis, also.
Holly and April, thanks for helping.
What?
I missed all of you. We're okay, aren't we?
I mean, you're really back.
Like keeping her home from school?
I didn't tell you because I didn't think it was important.
No, it just makes you doubly responsible doesn't it?
I never saw Agnes until she set foot in this convent. My sister ran away from home. We lost touch with her. And when my husband died and I came here, she wrote to me and asked me if I would take care of Agnes in case anything happened.
And Agnes' father?
You lied to me
About what?
Your niece!
And... May I kiss you, like in the movies, may this be an exception?
...I'm going to kiss you.
Of course, so kiss me quickly, or they'll notice us.
Here. Whenever you want them.
That's right!
This is more fun than just pretend.
Of course. And Two is the prince who kneels before her on one knee.
Yes, yes! I see Prince,
There's an oak leaf. Add a maple.
Of course,
What's funny?
You're impossible...
Tell me.
Where is he?
Do you understand what I'm trying to say?
Yeah, I'll bet! So, how's it going with what's-her-name? Dana?
So, what kind of stuff do you guys do together? Is she into old records and stuff?
Sounds good...
What, are you trying to get rid of me?
Aren't you even going to ask me how I'm doing?
Right, right. I don't feel connected to many people, either. Other than John.
Can I tell you something personal? I feel like I can. It's something I couldn't tell John. Or wouldn't, anyway.
John . . .?
Good. I'm sure we'll be friends.
You're angry--
You didn't know?
Uh, yes... Sure, David.
Oh, it's... I wanted to tell you that, if you'd like, you being so busy, I could take Grace to her therapy exercises for you. I have to go in once a week for shopping anyway.
Thank you. You're all doing too much.
Not at all.
Yes, I could. I have an office in the hospital.
Me? Internal medicine.
I've got patients coming in --
No one has ever dumped me.
I did the 23 hour nose-route to the top of El Capitan in 6 hours! I can make this work.
Didn't hear it.
You've never been alone and you can't be alone --
Do you think Bloody Bill's trying to get into her draws?
Oh Jerry.
You ready?
It's good luck before an audition. She'll be all right once it starts.
Last time you were gone for a week!
I don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. You're being irreverent.
I don't want to hear any tales about colored people...
I won't have you fighting over me.
What happened to Shelly?
She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
I think Jamie's been seeing Karl again.
Lafayette two-one-hundred.
Ring that number, will you?
I said earlier that my husband and I are supporting Leonard in his photography, Mr Lombard. By this I mean that since his return from America I have been depositing for him a monthly allowance in an account we jointly hold. So as you see, I did not have to break the law to find out if he used the account.
-- well you better go after her.
Great? He's 17 -- you told her to stay away from him.
No chance in hell, Mr. Garrison. I'd be arrested and gagged, declared insane and hospitalized... maybe worse. You, too. I can only give you background, you got to find the foreground, the little things... Keep digging. Y'know you're the only person to ever bring a trial in the murder of John Kennedy. That's important - it's historic.
Kings are killed, Mr. Garrison. Politics is power, nothing more. But don't believe me. Don't trust me. Do your own work, your own thinking.
Look... You made a very calculated move, and then made me feel embarrassed for responding to you. That wasn't necessary.
I can back him off.
Hook you up? The Mau-Mau's? You must be smoking. Why in the world would I want to hook up a bunch of red, black and green flag-waving pseudo revolutionairies?
Who are you revolting against?
Sorry - it's a reflex. Living in an orphanage if someone bothers you - you automatically come up swinging.
By pulling my hair?!
I'll always go back to that church. Look at my painting.
Of course. When?
I've clung to you. I've clung to you. Kip. Life a raft.
I'm thinking about your heart, not your skin. And how to reach it. And that I don't think I can. A bomb has ruined us, just not the bomb I thought would ruin us.
Sir? What did he say?
I'm still here.
I was so afraid you ...
You don't quit on me, Violet, and I won't quit on you.
And, Alvy... and then I told her about how I didn't think you'd ever really take me seriously, because you don't think that I'm smart enough.
Promise me, Benjamin.
Then give me your word you won't.
Thank you. Benjamin --
I'm sure it is.
It's pretty embarrassing. I really don't know what to tell Mr. Robinson. It's awkward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up Elaine.
You'll think about my offer?
Well, I need to study, and...
I think that we should spend some time apart.
Jesus Christ, stay here, don't move, stay right here --
Life. I said, "life."
I'm not going without you.
Someone named Hockley, I should imagine.
Calm down. Just listen for a minute.. Please.
Thanks, but I think I'm gonna stick to my mom, she led a fascinating life too.
Shoes?
Go tell your father we're eating.
Can you stay for dinner?
I guess it depends on what you give up on.
David?
Everyone. Working overtime. Just for you.
Yes. We're suing.
David, he signed an agreement that he wouldn't talk to the press and he's libeled me by saying I faked the figures. You're not going soft on me, are you?
No. What's wrong with the front?
Even more reason to see him. He'll be overjoyed with your success.
Regardless, he still is your father.
Richmond is not all the way down south.
He's performing at some place outside of Richmond, Virginia.
When?
Peerless, last time, go see your father.
Norman, don't do it!
I wish they'd stop that. It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick? He must be in New York.... Where do you think you're going?
Yes -- Just exactly.
Where are you going now?
No, wait a minute -- there's someone else.
Tom... He was there last night when Bobby told me what he saw.
Greg, it isn't a wild tale. It's true. If there were only some way --
You've never believed a word I told you about Mr. August.
What have you done about Irving August?
Sh-h-h Nancy. The other children.
Thanks.
Come on, mom. Don't fall asleep...
Our car won't start.
Yeah, but I don't know what.
You don't want the fish.
'Cause if it was me, I could just catch a Greyhound back.
What must I do?
It's all right. You know I was thinkin' there's this girl that works with me. She's real heavy, but she's cute in the face. Well, you know, she's slow. She's a little bit, I think. She's not retarded, just -- it don't matter, listen to me. I thought you might like to meet her. Vaughan wants to have a little supper over at his house and we could invite her. Would you like that?
Well, is that a happy face I see?
Okay.
Oh!
But I wanna write about her.
Yeah, I know.
People don't fly down in their own god damn plane for "just a meeting" --
What are you going to do?
I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
It's places like this that make me certain there's a God.
Nice to meet you. I'm Marsha Dwiggins and this is Theresa Evans. She's here to take the pictures.
They're gone.
Yes.
Yes.
Your face ... are you hurt?
I don't know. I'm all right.
In you go! Moncho, lead the way! You stay here.
Yes sir.
All right. I'll postpone the whole thing until tomorrow night.
I love you dad.
I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook.
Hello.
I'm sorry to go on about it. But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.
You're being deliberately obtuse.
For what?
-- you've got to leave.
She gave me a ring, so I'm giving her a ring. I paid twenty-five cents for it, too.
Just you wait!
You can't open it yet. You have to put all of them under the tree until morning.
Oh, thank you, darling.
These are all from me.
Put on your blue suit...
Don't you know the sort of thing that Information Retrieval does?
What are you talking about-
What are you doing in Information Retrieval?
...cigarette girls... And naturally -
How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? The garden walls are high and hard to climb, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Only one tooth?
Only one arm?
Come on, kid, let's see if there's any food in the house.
You're not going out to look for them?
Oh, I wasn't worrying. I saw him saddling up and thought he was ready to leave.
Have you got leave to go to confession to-day?
What's so important in Los Angeles?
I've been re-reading Arsonist's Daughter. It's so beautiful, Grady. So natural. It's like all your sentences always existed, just waiting around in Style Heaven, or wherever, for you to fetch them down.
Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow?
Evan wake up, oh please wake up!
If I was, then I would've had to have gone in the sphere, wouldn't I?
He's the manager!
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down. He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.
Oh no, nothing of the sort.
We're going to friends now, sir.
Is he going to be alright?
Where're you going?
When you're done can you make sure she brushes her teeth?
It's our money. He had no right to take it.
Oh, yes, it's Thursday. Hello, Rose, dear... ... my, you're... looking pretty...
No one's ever stood up to my brother the way you did.
No.
All right, mommy.
If you're up to it, I've got us set up in a suite upstairs --
Go Carole. So, guess what?
Your shorts are looking especially gold today.
Were you watching me?
Get him!
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I can't tell you how thrilled I am to be here. It's like a dream come true. And speaking of dreams ...
How come? The army?
I have to have that money, Roy. What do I have to do to get it?
Evelyn Waugh was a man.
Evelyn Waugh?
What did it want?
I just didn't think that I could antagonize him, Steve -- for OUR sake, I mean.
But you just gotta hear me out on one thing. You're very responsible with Ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.
Just trying to be civil Dwayne.
That Jesus Christ was the Son of God and he came to die for your sins.
You believe that man is the be-all and end-all?
OK. OK. Fine. But -- do you believe in God?
Close your eyes.
I know honey. Just remember what I said, we'll bide our time. You just steer clear of him as much as you can. Doyle's had a real hard life. It's just about run him crazy I think.
Here, practice on your arm like this.
Uh huh. Okay, enough practice.
Uh huh.
Maybe we should, just to see what's the big deal.
Well, I can help.
I don't mind waiting.
Aw, Betty.
Carolyn -- you want these candlesticks?
I do not need instructions from you to bathe! I knew you'd do this! I knew I'd come all the way here and be shut out as usual! I came to be here for you! I didn't have to come! Lord knows I was never much welcome in this house before. Apparently dead or alive, nothing's changed.
Why do you do it, Laura?
And I love you, too. But don't wear my stuff.
No. You can have them.
All my things have me in them. I don't want you to be like me.
Cause I like it.
Just for a minute then.
I see -- you do only what you take pleasure in doing. You take pleasure in coming into a woman's bedroom and you come. You take pleasure in a dangerous climb onto a balcony, so you do it... And what is your pleasure now?
The stage frays one's nerves... the discipline -- it's so exacting. Discipline means doing what you don't want to do and take no pleasure in doing. Do you know what I mean? Have you ever experienced the weariness that comes from discipline?
Why do you smile?
What does that mean?
Vegas.
-- that can't happen. Earl doesn't want him to have the money, the things.
I don't feel so well. Have you seen Telly anywhere?
While you were in the shower.
Wait...
Uh-huh.
Early night for you, isn't it?
Mulholland Drive.
I wanted to meet your brothers...
Was she married or something?
-- you wouldn't last five minutes.
Yes.
I'm sorry. That is not my business.
I'm getting divorced.
What are you doing?
But why, Son of Malkovich?
Just a coincidence?
Nothing. Don't go, Craig. I've been thinking. Let's try to work this out. We've got so much history.
Some. I am a rich bitch, remember? I'm quoting.
What're we going to do?
Were taking you back to the nurse.
Oh. So what did you do after you gave up on acting?
So here we are again. Staring three years of operational duty in the face.
Um, well, yeah. So are you still acting?
Yeah.
Him getting us stranded out here doesn't do much good either.
Why are you so uptight?
We're not gonna do anything.
I thought you'd be up with the sun.
It means I'm gonna shampoo my hair and stay out of your way.
Do you need anything? I'll go to the pharmacy. I have some Demerol at home.
I know. Don't say anything.
Dad, I've become a woman without her. Just not a pretty one.
Fine. But I need to start deciding how to spend my time and my life.
I'm supposed to always be alone?
By accident --
You think so.
Suits me fine!
Darling, I've been thinking about our little Brad problem? And I think it's time we move to Plan B...
You cannot believe what he said, it was the worst instant of my total life on Earth!!
Why? A man appears at your side, almost never leaves it, you clearly trust him, depend on him, I sense you value him deeply, why aren't those things good enough for me?
No, that never solves anything. You talk like the big girl you are. About what you feel. And how he's hurt you. You know? You tell the truth.
What are you afraid of, Dad? That I'll fall head over heels for Joe -- well, I have -- as you did with Mom. That's always been standard, whether you like or not.
Because I was sitting in a staff meeting, incredibly bored, my mind kept wandering and the only place it landed was -- Joe.
Love. Passion. Obsession, all those things you told me to wait for. Well, they've arrived.
Tim, why don't you shut the fuck up?
Where?
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, "Ewww. A slug."
You've got to respect that.
I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to.
La collectionoose . It s about a young girl in the south of France who seduces a different man every night and then meets one who resists her. It s on TV tonight and as I m in I thought we could perhaps look at your accounts and... The review says it s about the conflict between intellect and instinct. And witty. The director s supposed to be famous. Rommel or something. French. You must know him?
Peerless, your father called.
Could I speak to you in private?
Rose. Rose DeWitt Bukater.
Mr. Dawson, I --
Oh, the thing! Oh, the thing... ...yeah... yeah.
Thing?
What thing?
Hey-
You are very kind.
Yeah, I'll be in.
Bye, bye, honey. See you tomorrow?
Bye, Aunt Rita.
The arguments, anyway.
Okay, then let's make it easy. It was a mistake. Don't make me feel guilty now that it's over, let's forget about it.
You gotta get another tour. We're gettin' too old for this.
I'm not saying it's your fault.
So, you just let us drive on knowing we were losing fuel? Knowing we were going to run low in the middle of nowhere?
Make someone happy-have you ever wanted to?
May be easy to remember, but not easy to get. Being warm, maybe -- but, look, you don't even have a coat and I still have to chop wood to make a fire. And, being happy...you tell me if that's simple.
You remember it?
That was lovely!
And the people he hurts the most are the people who love him. Despite who he is and what he does for a living. We're always saying we want to take control of our lives. You don't want to take control. You want to lose control. Jesus knows it.
And?
You're a family man, Frankie?
Go on, tell him. Tell the truth. Tell him how you feel, shooting a piece of hot metal in somebody's flesh who was once a child, who was once the same age as this boy. Somebody's flesh who was innocent once.
We can be happy. We really can. We love you, Dick. The girls and I...
Yeah ... Saw you too.
Really?
You're so good to protect her like this.
Yes. I didn't plan it that way.
What'd you say?
It's going to be all right, Jake. It's going to be all right. Don't be afraid. I've got you now.
So tell me ... am I still an angel?
Yes. They felt like traffic accidents.
Viktor, you should have said something.
Hey.
Look, I...
I'd love to see your work.
Wow. Do a puppet show for me, Craig honey.
You still there, sweets?
What do you mean?
Little.
A drink.
If I may be so bold...
You still care about me?
You were acting like a different person.
Praying.
Last night.
These questions have nothing to do with your trial.
Yes.
Gee, this looks like a fun place.
Schoenick... your Lieutenant is about to make a real bad career move...
Hello, darling. Good evening, Mr. Carpenter.
Did you have a nice day, dear?
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed.
Aaah -- -- ello. You sure they said the management meeting? They want me to be at the management meeting.
A long time. I was restless. Will you crack my neck?
I feel safe here. And it's where I can talk to him.
I don't want to bore you with all the sordid details of my life; it's not a happy story...
I'm sorry we had to take the stairs. It was just that horrible little elevator boy...
The couch, please.
Hi, Bobo.
My boss is a guy named Bobo Justus, back in Baltimore. When a long shot gets too much action, I have to put money on that horse at the track, because it's the only way to get the odds down.
What are you doing here?
Oh, better not, Walter. Wouldn't do any good.
Well, he's waiting in the anteroom for me now.
Last time they won, Dr. J. was a nurse.
You're stupid. And your Daddy plays for the worst team in the NBA.
If you screw me up for tonight, I'll kill you, I swear to God, I'll kill you.
Now you got me.
Oh, no . . . Mummy's awfully good at it.
I wouldn't want my private business being discussed with a complete stranger!
and HERBERT exchange a glance. HONORA smiles at Juliet.
Well, actually, Mummy's left that programme now . . she's far too busy with The Marriage Guidance Council.
I've heard your mother on 3YA. The Woman's Session has lots of lively debate.
I'm sorry, Bruce, I Just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation.
As much as I do. It's not that. I don't want to be depressing, that's all.
God. You would. Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment.
But it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even --
... We could try that.
Boy I am so glad to be through with all these games.
The Oswalds are introduced by George de Mohrenschildt to Janet and Bill Williams. It's through Janet Williams in October '63 that Lee gets the warehouse job, right smack on Elm Street at the Book Depository, which is owned by another oilman with ties to defense and military intelligence.
Goodbye.
Benjamin?
Will you kiss me!
When I was twenty.
Oh. Well... they were dancing on the couch with that weird English guy who kept talking about hanging out with the Sex Pistols on Kings Road...
Oh, for her show?
Oh.
From the first time I saw you at school--all those years we were married to other people I always felt like we were connected.
I've never seen my mother in a bathing suit before. Didn't know she owned one.
They can't pull this on me. It isn't fair--I don't believe this--
She'll figure it out sooner or later. I don't have to ask permission anymore, if that's what you mean.
Couple months before I was born--
What?
Who are these people?
Why not buy them milk or something-- instead of Dr. Pepper?
Very funny, smart ass.
That's 'cause I was cursed with the Sultenfuss Bear Claws. My hands fit.
My mother stood on this very spot.
Why today? And why'd she have to go with him?
What's he smoking?
I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A.
I don't! Look, you could get to know me, again.
Say what, Manray?
Just ask me what you want to know.
That's ancient history. That has nothing to do with you and I.
We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned.
Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
Hurry up and get dressed.
You're a hell of a boy, Frank. Someday you're gonna get all the good things you deserve. And Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits tonight. What do you think about that?
Yes. I'm fine. It's just this heat I think.
Knox?!
Chet...
Don't stop.
You know,
...Yah, okay, I think I'll drive down there, then.
A thousand times good night! Exit, above
By and by, I come: -- To cease thy strief, and leave me to my grief: To-morrow will I send.
Eeeww!
I told them you were an alcoholic and I would take you home. I also promised that we would never come in there again.
Eggs.
You were OK for a while, so we walked for about a block and then you said you wanted to go home and fuck, but I think even you knew that wasn't going to happen. We got a cab and you asked him to stop at a liquor store, even though I told you that we had plenty at home. In the store you gave the kid a hundred and told him to keep the change. I asked you if you knew it was a hundred. You said you did, so I let you do it. We got here, you fell asleep on the couch and I covered you up and came to bed.
Here's my speech... ...I know this shouldn't be acceptable to me, but it is. Don't ask me why. I sense that your trouble is very big... and I'm scared for you... and so I'm doing what I think you need me to do. Falling down in casinos is little stuff. It doesn't bother me. It has nothing to do with us.
Why? What difference does it make? You already got his money...
I feel so embarrassed.
But I was only trying to be friendly...
Because I'm going to get my father!
She asked me not to.
You have to follow me?
If I pick it up, we'll only get back together.
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it!
Hi, I'd like to make an appointment for Peter Kelson.
Maybe what?
Okay, I'm very sorry. My sexual problem! Okay, my sexual problem! Huh?
God damn it, Clifford, will you shut up! I tell you, I want to give these things! I want to give them to the audience, and I can give them, I will give them, so shut up!
I'm not!
Thank you.
What?
Oh well. I guess I better leave then.
Hi Mr. Bixler!
It's okay. Mr. Bixler, I finished all the books for summer reading.
Yes, and now I'm reading War amp; Peace for fun.
Mr. Bixler, how come you're painting this old house?
Sure.
Uh, nothing. I'm going to pick it up in the other room -- would you hang this up for me?
Chi-Chi has gone to doggie heaven, bitch!
He sent us out to the Fender Compound. Out in the desert near the Chicken Ranch.
That's my best friend. His name is Choco. He's always fancied me... but too shy to ever do anything about it.
What am I to do with the packages if...
Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
As far as I'm concerned, I think she's alive... Why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.
I... I don't know... I didn't think it was worthwhile... She was laughing over it...
Maybe you'd better ask him.
Is it Wednesday? It's Wednesday. How embarrassing. I don't know what I was thinking. With all the excitement lately... Am I interrupting something? Are you expecting company?
When is she coming over?
It's not a woman, it's a fish. No one ever catches her.
How old are you?
What did she look like?
Was she nekkid?
I don't want them left back.
I'm eight. That means when I'm eighteen, you'll be 28. And when I'm 28, you'll only be 38.
Yeah. Yeah, it kind of does.
I came over as soon as I got that cold ultrasound goo off my pelvis. My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we were escorted off the premises.
What...
This is the baby. Your baby.
Oh my God...
Doesn't it look like it's waving? It's kind of like it's saying "Hi, Vanessa. Will you be my mommy?"
Hey, what kind of swag did you score?
...you want us to go to War with Albania.
'Cause I'll tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.
Uh-huh.
Well... I'm tired all the time, obviously. I always feel like taking a nap. But when I try to sleep, I have trouble. My muscles ache. And my joints. I feel like an old person, or like I did back when I used to work out too hard... What else?...
Holy shit. Who do they represent, God?
Plus, 40 percent of 20 million's a whole lot of money.
Do you think we'd do better by going to trial?
How many days and nights do you have to go... ...here?
When do you have to be here?
How will I do this one?...
Sun...
Sun... day. No sun... night. You understand?
That's important.
Donnie Darko is a cool name. Sounds like a superhero.
He fled. They still can't find him. My mom and I had to change our names and stuff. I thought Gretchen sounded kind of cool.
You mean soap?
I should go. For physics. Monnitoff says I have to write an essay on the greatest invention ever to benefit mankind.
Wonder where we'll be then.
The white reflects the sun; it keeps you cooler. That's why they wear them.
Yes. Very much.
I can't tell you. I'm sworn to secrecy.
I don't know. I've been hearing some awful things about him.
What do you mean?
This Scottish rebel... Wallace? He fights to avenge a woman?
Forever.
Then you've heard too.
Well...I guess not.
What is your problem?
Enough.
What?
Hello.
Five feet? Seven feet?
Oh, Peter.
-- these were the values that were instilled in me while I was growing up in a little town you've probably never heard of --
No thank you. Seek and ye shall find, work and ye shall prosper -- these were the watch words of my education, the ethics of my tender years --
No, it's... it's nothing, it's...
You don't drink "booze".
Right.
Eddie this is silly... are we supposed to pretend nothing's happened in the last ten years and --
Eddie, if I wanted to make love with you again, I'd do it sober.
No!... Shaw! Director of The Trade Mart? This is incredible.
So -- how long will you be gone this time?
Chopped liver?
Are you gay?... baked apple?... they're cold but they're good.
You wouldn't even sip champagne at our wedding. We were underage -- you wouldn't break the law. Remember what my brother called you?
I didn't hear you.
Answer my question!
Are you threatening me with legal action, Mr. Fabian?
Thank you.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
Do you know what I gave up to be with you?
I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair!
How many years did I live with your beams and boards? First in the garage, then in the living room. We're going to do it, Robin. Next year. Next year. Salvaged floorboards from a house in Pasadena. Doors from a church in New Hampshire...
No maid service! For God's sake, can't you read the fucking "do not disturb" sign on the fucking doorknob?
Well, I'm gonna experiment on you for my anatomy class, then go.
Funny, Jack. I m laughing on the inside.
Because you ll be here.
Telling my mother she doesn t have to stay with the kids.
You look forward to this party all year. What s with you today?
You should call your dad before it gets too late.
I already did. This morning. When you went running.
I wanted to meet a man who could write such a long paper with so few adjectives.
So there you are. It seemed odd, suddenly, your not being there...
Why should you think I wouldn't be?
No classes this morning?
IT'S ALMOST LUNCHTIME. ARE YOU HUNGRY!?
Whatever you want.
Fine!
Fine.
He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't "worked for him" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. He liked to acquire things.
It's happened before. I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I?
We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon.
It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened.
What's he doing out there?
What are the doctors saying?
I forgot, "Q-man."
Well, I tried sneaking in after college, but they found breasts during my physical.
I don't think so.
Yes.
His most cherished possession? His violin, I guess.
Ed, who is Daniel Davis?
Huckleberry Hound?
No jokes about my name? Oh, you wouldn't do that; you're trying to be nice.
Oh my darlin', oh my darlin', oh my darlin' Clementine? No?
Yeah. Although it hardly fits. I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.
Would anybody else see the tape?
What makes you think I'd discuss that with you?
You just want to ask me questions?
And that's all?
Is this how you get off or something? Taping women talking about their sexual experiences?
Townsend, he had some of Father's books.
No. He wants to be working for himself someday.
What?
Not without you.
They run routes mostly east, retail stuff, warehouses. But Gabriel knows some guys in New York, Miami, guys he helps get guns to Detroit. Hides 'em with his regular loads.
What was that?
Is it hurting, dear?
Oh, is there anything else you remember, how did you propose? Was it romantic?
There's still a big spot on the floor.
Can I just ask for one thing?
Aw, shit, Thelma, he's gonna kill you.
Well, he has never let me go. He never lets me do one goddamn thing that's any fun. All he wants me to do is hang around the house the whole time while he's out doing God only knows what.
How come he let you go?
'Cause I didn't ask him.
It's Bob's, the day manager's. He's gettin' a divorce, so his wife's gettin' this place, so he's just lettin' all his friends use it till he has to turn over the keys.
I've never had the chance to go out of town without Darryl.
Whose place is this again?
Would you?
I can't help it. I'm just so proud of you. You've got the highest grades in all of your classes.
Please. He got straight A's without ever touching a book. That was the one area where his memory never failed him.
See, if we took the hood off, we'd have to shoot you. As it is, you've got a fifty-fifty chance.
It was fun while it lasted.
Ouch!
Oh, you know, I, I love that book you lent me. The Easter Parade? You were right. It had very special meaning for me.
Oh, well, you know Frederick. One of his moods. Although it wasn't a bad week. He uh, sold a picture.
Sister Paul?
She... she fell over backwards.
Amy, listen to me. Death isn't such a terrible thing.
I guess these are all yours. Impeach, uh, Eisenhower... Impeach Nixon... Impeach Lyndon Johnson... Impeach Ronald Reagan.
I left instructions with Julia. She'll get it from you. Goodbye.
Thanks, and goodbye.
Yes, Amy.
You?
It's Johnny Cammareri.
What?
Please, Bobbie, we're pushing.
Go back to 316, Bobbie. The sound bite in the cab -- it starts, 'I don't know how I'll feel...'
Play back the last line...
We're working here!! You can stand over in the uh, uh, uh...
That was the beginning, the night of the conception. That's why she burnt the sheets.
So here we are!
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
It's given me a big lift to know that some people want me for myself, not just because I'm my brother's sister.
Henry, next time, couldn't Mister Hebbing --
No, Mama, I'll take care of it. I'll wash them in the morning.
I'm sorry. It's these goddamned shoes. I don't know how anyone actually walks in these things.
Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
No.
I'll see ya there.
And?
Did you ask Sal?
People finding out... seeing... that the LAPD just flat out executed Jeriko One. Jesus. Maybe they ought to see.
Ah, Mom.
I'm sorry... about what I said. It's just that -- all those times you and Daddy were trying for another kid, I... I used to pray at night that it would work. And not because of you guys or that I wanted a brother or sister... but... just so I wouldn't have to be...
The fuck not?
Can we show him Pilgrim, Tom?
Did you notice -- no cane?
Let's bring your bags inside.
Wait till you see this -- we have the whole house to ourselves...
Is there anything you need? I'm going food-shopping.
Well, I am going to go after lunch.
No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
It still hurt. A lot.
You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again --
Sure. I loved it.
Jeff likes to argue for the sake of arguing.
Oh fucking relax. Let your hair down for once. It's your fucking birthday, for Chrissakes. You're such a fucking pussy. I swear to G-d, I married this big time drug dealer and wound up with the maid.
No, I'm just saying --
Just because someone chooses to settle down and have a family doesn't necessarily mean they're hypnotized. Just because I've never seen a gazelle stampede doesn't mean I'm asleep in the world.
But no one in particular.
But it's not the same.
How will he do that?
You'll need them for parties. You'll need them for New Year's Eve. Where are your evening clothes?
Nothing, if you work in a fill- ing station. And I'm getting rather bored with that sport jacket, and those same baggy pants. Max, what's a good men's shop in town? The very best... Well, go there !
Why begrudge me a little fun? I just want you to look nice, my stray little boy.
Of course you do. A tuxedo and tails.
Yes, I do.
What about insurance? Doesn't insurance pay for these things?
But you didn't lose me.
How are you going to pay when you get sick?
Oh... Well.
Next you'll be sick.
Oh, well, I knew that before you- even left. I told you, 'Kenny, that old Nash won't make it down the road.' But you had to go.
Oh, uh huh. I had a little kittycat once, that Bobby give me...
My skip-trace turned up two Cecil Stipes. One's in Butte, Montana. Other's at Riverhead Veterans Psychiatric.
You read Eddie's Chase Manhattan Bombing summation in the Leftist Law anthology?
So let's go.
The worm eats a few cents from each transaction.
Some one comes up hot on your six, what do you do?
I can't.
Yes. I'll give you that!
Maverick...you know the rules of engagement.
Lieutenant...
... you want to be Margo's new understudy.
I don't let myself think about it, even- - but I do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl- - but suppose I had to go on one night? To an audience that came to see Margo Channing. No, I couldn't possibly...
Nobody's done so much, Eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the Hundred Neediest Cases... what is it?
Well... Miss Channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as I should be, really - not that I've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day - when I heard Mr. Fabian tell Miss Channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...
Karen.
Karen... ... isn't it awful, I'm about to ask you for another favor - after all you've already done.
Lloyd says Margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality... ... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket... ... you've done your share, Eve. You've worked wonders with Margo...
Mrs. Richards.
Tell me, Eve - how are things with you? Happy?
There should be a new word for happiness. Being here with Miss Channing has been - I just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me-
Can I ask - my friend, can he come in? Just for a few minutes?
Excuse me -
He's going back to the front this evening. I can't see him otherwise.
To put me to bed? Take my clothes off, hold my head, tuck me in, turn off the lights, tiptoe out...? eve would. Wouldn't you, Eve?
And winter?
Oh no...
What if I did take them? I'm sick and tired of seeing you hand out thousands of dollars to that family of yours....
But... but why, Harry...? Why'd they do it?
Somebody shut his lights. I guess the little guy sat in there, waitin' for his buddy t'come back.
Fifty minutes.
We know.
There, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. Isn't that right, sweetie.
This is not what the university has in mind when it promises a liberal education, Grady.
You sent for me, sir?
What do you do? What are you doing here?
Three months.
My father was one of the officers in the plot against Hitler. They arrested the plotters and their families.
This isn't meant --
I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny.
Friend? What's she look like? Maybe I can help you find her.
Who's Nina?
Sure.
Ed? How many people live here?
Like diamonds, huh? I never get over it. When I was a little girl, my mama'd stand me before the window and tell me to close my eyes and make a wish.Like I could reach out and grab all the lights of the city and string them into-a necklace for myself. She'd take my hand and when she closed her eyes, I don't know, it was like she really believed it.
He hasn't had breakfast yet.
A trip, you mean?
I did?
Do you like quotes, Howard?
Charlie really has a great voice.
Hi.
Am I afraid of them? Not during the day. Sea snakes are diurnal. When the sun's out, they don't bite. Fortunately for you, I had on my watch. This is quite good.
You don't think I put something in it, do you?
Don't get your hopes up.
You can stay here.
Where do you live?
Process server. Ma said it's like a lawyer only the hours are more regular. All I know's he came to take the TV one afternoon and ended up staying for dinner. And breakfast.
Did you break a cup, Jack?
Guess they're up.
I told ya.
Hi, Mom. How you doing? Here, let me get you some coffee. That's enough of that. What triggered it?
Don't make it worse, Dad.
And the flowers... Let's not pick them. They're so nice.
What else did Padiche say?
And so I get this straight, we gotta go in, bust on this punk and remove the heart? Is that for real?
A vote is before the group.
Good. That's it...See you.
Very well. What is it you're proposing, Mister McMurphy?
Mister McMurphy, the purpose of this meeting is therapy. Group therapy.
Let me pose a question to the group: do any of you feel that Mister McMurphy is perhaps imposing his personal desires on you too much?
So what are you doing with a dog?
You're not worried that someone might take him?
A visitor.
God, it's so clean out here.
It is! Take the back stairwell -
The ship is sailing wihout us!
I... I am a little child but my body keeps getting bigger and soon I... I won't be able to fit in, I... I won't be able to squeeze into Heaven.
Agnes dear, Heaven is not a place where...
It's a sin to be fat.
Why?
Look at the statues, they're thin.
Agnes...
That's because they're suffering... suffering is beautiful, I want to be beautiful.
Who tells you these things?
Christ said it in the Bible, he said - suffer the little children, I want to suffer like a little child.
That's not what he meant.
Someone crying. A girl. I thought I was crazy.
OK.
I'll be back in 137 hours.
So why this ?
Do you have something better to talk about ?
You're afraid to risk believing. Believe in them. Believe in your self. Take a risk. It will humanize you as a person.
If you believed, you wouldn't be walking around with a handgun in your belt. What does that tell me? You want to make the night come down.
I don't like it.
Alice got married again.
Let's try it again, only this time I'm going to stick my tongue in your mouth. When I do that I want you to massage my tongue with yours. That's what first base is.
It was nothing.
And a son by your ex-wife? Joseph.
I understand. How often do you see your son?
Haven't you ever practiced with one of your girlfriends?
Ah duh. Boys. I've never even gone to first base with a guy. What do I do?
It's not gross. How else do you think girls learn? Here turn around and face me.
Eww. No. That's gross.
Are you for real?
See that wasn't so bad.
I guess. It still sounds gross.
I'm in love with you. Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along.
I hope not. He's already busted the springs in two chairs. Hey, what's this?
I wondered when you might ring the bell again, Officer White.
Hi, how are you?
Oh it's good, quot;In lieu of quot; I love that word lieu.
What do you know about hypnosis?
...Huh?
We tried to point that out. But there were some pretty nosey citizens who wouldn't listen to reason. They said Aspen had outgrown us. It's all right to play poker in your own home but not in a saloon.
Aspen doesn't want us Mr. Graham. They threw us out.
Thank you, Mr. Graham.
No, I...
Because all she thinks about are these guys she's after and I just hate her she's such a little slut I thought that in high school and I think that now. Why do people have to be so obsessed with sex all what's the big damn deal? I mean, it's okay and everything, but I don't understand when people let it control them, control their lives, why do they do that?
Give it back to him. We're leavin'.
You're sure there's more where this came from?
Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
Open it and find out.
Open your door.
You don't mind, really, do you, Roy? It's been such a wonderful evening, I guess I just wore myself out.
Separate bathrooms, darling. I will not lay out all my cosmetics for you to knock over.
No.
It was perfect, George. Amazing. It was so real.
It does doesn't it?
I know.
Good.
We haven't been away together for three years. What difference does a few months make?
Dashboard.
Eh... police.
I dreamed about your house last night.
Well, I'll call him when he does.
Oh, please. Okay, so give me the Zen master's address, I'll think of a reason to stop by.
She's a grown-up, she can handle it.
I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away.
Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world.
I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that.
What terrible thing in Cave Springs?
No. Get in.
She'd never called me like that before. She sounded more ... pissed off -- angry -- than upset or afraid. But she never turned up. I called the house but only got the answer machine. When they found her ... she'd been going the wrong way. Not the direction she'd have gone if she'd been coming to see me. Or coming straight to see me. Who knows. Maybe she just wanted to drive.
You shouldn't drink so much of that stuff. It's bad for you.
Hurry up.
You think Terry gave me access to her things? Probably sold her clothes.
I don't, but...
How the hell would you know?
You sure weren't acting like the Pete Dayton I've always known.
I just can't look at you.
No, I'm not... I'm not.
What do you mean?
-- it's 2.99 per minute for the first half hour and 1.99 per minute after that.
And your name?
What'd I say?
What's the matter?
Better than that.
You're upset.
You were convicted of the crime.
You're not crazy.
I went for a drive. Up in the hills.
I guess I'd ask you why.
I did.
Yes.
It's a crime.
I wouldn't do it.
I went out.
Welcome to the singles scene.
Yes, I'm sure it is. That's what they say, anyway.
Bravo!
Now, wait a minute, Chauncey you are young, you are healthy, for God's sake don't give up on yourself! You have to fight! You can't let those bastards keep you down! I don't want to hear any more from you about the 'Room Upstairs'. That's where I'm going soon.
Oh, I know exactly what you mean. I sometimes enjoy puttering around myself, such a pleasant way to forget one's troubles.
A gardener! Well put, Chauncey excellent! Isn't that what a businessman is? A gardener? A person that makes flinty soil productive with the labor of his own hands, who waters it with the sweat from his own brow, and who creates a place of value for his family and community? Yes, Chauncey, what a brilliant metaphor -- yes, indeed, a productive businessman is a laborer in his own vineyard.
And so you do! The only time you come out is to eat.
No, it's right he should hear. I'm sick to death of it. We can't do anything right for you, can we?
And don't tell her I told you.
Secret's safe with me.
Like a big sister.
Is it two? Or is it three? Have you ever really noticed?
Milo, you told me those DOJ Agents are all over the place. How could they hope to hide a surveillance post? And how can you get in there, anyway? With the cameras and the swipe cards --
You can't just walk in, either.
But that doesn't add, does it.
Pour your own trouble, Will.
No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her.
No more, Lenny.
Why is it taking so long?
Remember me. Try your best. Maybe we can.
Sam. This is the last time.
This! Meeting you in secret so we can be... secretive! You come down here on business trips and we steal lunch hours and... I wish you wouldn't even come.
Sam!
I've lost my girlish laughter.
I haven't time to argue. I'm a working girl.
What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?
Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record. Especially for what he said, and I quote, "would be a highly anticipated event, locally." He helped me put out a press release.
I called Dan Koretzky because he --
I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore. It might even be why I came back.
Just local, of course.
They don't look too hard for guys like Jimmy.
That's right.
What?
I'm asking for your help, David. I want to go. They'll need someone relatively young, unattached -- and probably a scientist. As the President's Science Advisor you have enormous weight... I'm asking if you'll support my candidacy.
David... I know we've had our differences... but I've always thought of you as a fair man, even when we've disagreed -- and It's in that light I'm hoping you'll consider my request...
But she's such a nice lady.
...At the hour of midnight, down the road that goes through Sleepy Hollow, across the bridge, he goes galloping, galloping, always searching, always seeking
Ryan!
Maybe... I dunno... He wants to be, of course. I'm weighing several offers at the present time...
He's cute.
No I'm not.
Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say? Of course you do. Agnes, you're ugly!... what do you say?
Alright.
Please! I want to help you. Let me help you.
I'm afraid.
Agnes, oh Agnes, Agnes I want you to do something. I want you to pretend that I'm your mother. Oh yes, only this time I want you to tell me what you're feeling, alright?
She touches me down there with a cigarette. Please Mommy, don't touch me like that any more. I'll be good, I won't be a baby any more.
What?
And then...
Oh, yes.
If we stand a chance at all, it's only by sticking together.
Lloyd, be careful...
Peace and quit is for libraries.
Upstairs! Up-staiiirs! There isn't any STEREO!
I just don't want Margo to miss her train. As it is, she'll barely make the theater...
Of all people you should know what it means to want some peace and quiet-
That little place just two hours form New York. It's on my list of things-I'll-never-understand. Like collecting shrunken Indian heads...
David, cut it out. Mark Davis is gonna like be here in five minutes.
What time is it?
No such thing, baby.
Leave us ALONE for God's sake! ...Oh, it's Lou.
Your purse. I need ten dollars.
The Websters.
It's gone.
Allie, he's not.
Allie... he wants to tell me. I had a roll of film. His face was on it. He knew that -- And he let me keep.
He's not crazy.
I don't know. Nothin'. Took a shower.
I like 'em. If you don't you can f --
...coming home drunk and I guess feeling trapped by his life and blaming her for that...and...
At school. She fell for Kyle just before we graduated. Got pregnant, and...went to live in a trailer up on a woodlot Kyle's dad used to own. Kyle started spending more and more time at the Spread Eagle...
What do you mean?
Like now?
It's romantic, what you're doing, and they want to be a part of it.
Oh, do give him here! He needs to be comforted and held!
Look at them in the front offices -- the master minds! They took the idols and smashed them. The Fairbankses and the Chaplins and the Gilberts and the Valentinos. And who have they got now? Some nobodies -- a lot of pale little frogs croaking pish-poshl
Something wrong?
Remember, he's the son of a Senator, so go easy. Kid gloves.
Steve, I feel exhausted...what do you want me to do?
I was just late.
Really?
Then you should not have sought an explanation.
Oh -- too bad. Did you quarrel?
The soldiers are going to kill those people!
Hey, Mister. Mister. I just. . . I just wanted to thank you.
Eduard wanted to marry me.
No, you don't! Walter!
Of what?
Look out, you --
I'm going to my mother's.
Are you free tonight?
If I don't cooperate?
Where are my cigarettes?
Yes.
You didn't take it before. You didn't take it the time after that. And now, you didn't take it again?
I...can't.
Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm?
You're not stupid.
She understands.
I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
I'm saying that every so often those accused of a precrime might, just might, have an alternate future.
It didn't bite me.
Yuri... are you...
I have to change and take a shower first. If you want to come home and wait.
It's because of Jacqueline I can't go on looking for her --
Jacqueline is a murderess she killed a man.
I have to. It was Irving August -- everything Mrs. Redi said - it fits in with what I saw - she even knew I'd seen his body on the subway.
And Gregory -- he loves her.
He's Jacqueline's husband. I can't
Did you have lunch? Kyo will fix you something.
Just a few minutes ago.
'I'll be in the bedroom.'
Peter left me yesterday.
I kept thinking about it, what you said... I hope you were trying to keep me away fro the sake of me.
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Yeah, let's talk about that. You seem to be rather an expert. I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.
I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.
Otis! Come! Good boy! Come!
You walked out on a five year marriage.
Hey, any help you need, we'll cover.
Well, we won't keep you.
That guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... This one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...
Yeah, but... you know what I mean.
He should totally just kill himself... Hey, here's one ...Oh wait... you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...
I dunno... I kind of like him... He's the exact opposite of everything I really hate... In a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...
What are you doing here, Melorra?
Not really...
Forget it, I can't explain it...
Duke.
I'm pregnant.
Uh... I can assure you, Mister Daggett... the events described within are based... on the accounts of eye witnesses and...
Well, that's a long way off, sweetie. We'll talk to Mom and Dad...
You sure been acting like you were... ...Out whoopin' it up, a drankin' and ever' thang.
Your ship is a wonder, Mr. Andrews. Truly.
I don't know whether I saw you or not.
No, no, I'm definitely not asking for anything. Except maybe mercy. Like, it would be really great if nobody hit me.
You're married.
Thought what?
You just woke up this morning and suddenly decided to run for president?
Okay, Mr. Popular. You're on.
So Mr. McAllister asked you to run.
...You saw her?
But what can we do? She don't know who's visiting her...
...we, we love her, Dick and me...
She's not at home?
What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you.
You know how beautiful she was? Her husband left her, and he took her kids... They, they, they'd let you die in there. They don't care. Nobody cares. The Patriot Home, the Chronic Care... in Arlington...? They'd take her in. Perpetual care. They'd take her. Fifty thousand dollars they want. An endowment.
I don't know... where is she, then?
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.
No really, it's okay, I've gotta go. I'm expecting some calls. I'll be fine, really.
Listen, you're right. Don't do it. I'll just... send you an address, okay?
Tomorrow night. Can you come?
I don't know. Garber's left orders here not to let you in the building.
Don't look down!
Of course. I remember everything from your class.
I'm fucking crawling out of my skin.
You're afraid of the Ferris wheel.
How can you watch this crap?
I want to have a baby.
No. The school would probably contact you in the event of my expulsion.
Because I don't feel safe until I get the lights on.
Positive.
I never noticed his face.
What did I say?
Nobody. I love you, remember?
Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference.
Run, Daniel! Get out of here!
You're doing an amazing and selfless thing for us.
Shit, yeah. Close it up.
Yeah. Yeah! The way people used to do it. Quick and dirty, like ripping off a Band-Aid.
Well, no... I'm not going to sell the baby. I just want it to grow up with people who are ready to love it and be parents. I'm in high school, dude. I'm ill-equipped.
Excuse me?
Are you looking for any other compensation?
Who knows. Remember... Whatever Walter wants...
Now he's gone and made me fall in love with him, which I never wanted to do. I told him that.
He said I was right. I shouldn't wait for him. I was better to make a clean break.
What did he say?
Brian I want him out of our car!
Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do!
Why not just bring the whole toilet?
Yes...
...who...?
Mister White is...
We gotta get the stuff and get out of here.
We got to get out of here.
You killed him.
I thought we were dead.
Up the stairs - down the hall.
I can't accuse him just dry long 80.
Show me the tapes. I want to see them.
The bitch was bluffing. There were no dupe tapes. If there were... they'd have shown them to me by now.
It does me good to see you.
Because of the way you're looking at me now. The same way... as when we met.
What do you want from me? You want me to tell you everything that happened was okay?
It's over you, Gordon.
Pardon me, but you can't do -- !
That's terrific, but there's one problem: we don't have the means to receive all the data on our own.
It could be anything. The first volume of some Encyclopedia Galactica...
That's from skiing.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover.
Moreover...
Me.
Yes... A man I know took me to Switzerland last month...
I will not fail: 'tis twenty year till then.
Romeo! At what o'clock to-morrow Shall I send to thee?
Well thank you, hun. That's real good of you to say. I wouldn't know what to do without him either.
That's the old drive-in. They call it "The Court". Now it's just a continuous party for Guy's group.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
You should not bother with that birdhouse. If you're leaving tomorrow.
He's better, though, right?
All right. Now finish your drink.
It's all right.
Sit down.
You sure? I know my father would hate to be tied down. He wouldn't even go to the dentist.
No.
I've never been to it.
I'm meeting someone.
At the Zoo.
I'll pass the word on, then.
Brad, what would you say if I asked you to just put these flowers in the trunk of the Cruising Vessel and get rid of them at work?
I've seen worse. Much worse.
And you want a --
... Thank you.
For ever and ever.
Stop that!
What is it? You all of a sudden got this bug you had to go surfing? This is a line, right?
Almost. Mocky-Lock showed up.
"It was the lark, the herald of the morn, No nightingale. Look, love, what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east. Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops. I must be gone and live, or stay and die."
Scandalous! What would your dear mother say?
And you look so lovely.
That is my daughter. She say she and her husband are coming to town this afternoon. I am sorry, Mr. Jimmy. I will make it short.
Give my love to Shelly.
I will. How's Shelly?
Totally.
I'll to the FBI!
Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
Didn't do very well, did you?
Urdu and Hindi.
Hmm...
Right. How could he do that if he's in jail and they've thrown away the key...?
It hurts, it hurts so bad, make it stop.
I can't breathe, I'm suffocating.
Dr. Welty!!!? Dr. Welty??
You were reading my Renoir.
I am sure.
Sidney is a liar!
Thank you, Panes.
There's no question you'll be friends. Of course you'll be friends.
Come on, Jerry. You know this isn't easy for me. 118.
So what's your job this summer?
I know you, huh? The car pools, he measles, the PTA. It's not gonna be enough for you in the long run. You have to think long term.
Hey, you haven't quit on you, I'm sure as hell not gonna. I just mean, I'm juggling a lot right n...
Nothing. I didn't say anything.
Only because you want it.
Not to me.
It's not a prison, it's a hospital. There's got to be some way out of there and you've got to find it...
You'll die if you keep smoking those in your condition.
What do you mean?
No, I do. That's what I'm saying to you.
Am I... am I dead?
God defeated the English, not me.
My king will pay any ransom you ask.
You're tense. What are you all uptight about?
Why don't you just stay there, and you can have it everyday.
I have to go, Adam's tormenting Zoe, I'll talk to you later. Are you going to be Ok?
... You look wonderful...
I dunno...
I wish I could see him.
He's still just sitting there. God, this is totally unbearable!
What's he doing now?
Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been...
I've always been proud of the way nature singled me out. It's the people who have been deformed by society I feel sorry for. I've been steady moving for eleven years and some months. Maybe I should rest up for a spell, I'm not as young as I used to be.
I know.
Tired...
A born freak can only go uphill.
No. She really liked you.
Do you love your father?
Gone out with you. She woulda like rearranged your tonsils.
But it's romantic.
Well I've had like ten times as much sex as these girls and I'm still like this. They have one hour in the back of a car and suddenly they're in technicolor.
I mean, what do you want? What are you doing hanging around here.
I'm not fighting you, Jim, I'm just trying to reach you. You've changed.
I don't want to see, goddammit! I'm tired. I've had enough! They say you don't have anything anyway! Everybody in town's talking. You're ruining this man Shaw's life! You're attacking him because he's homosexual! Going ahead with this stupid "trial"! Did you ever once stop and consider what he's going through?
Oh, I don't know anymore! I believe there was a conspiracy, but not the government. I just want to raise our children and live a normal life! I want my life back!
You never talked to me this way before, Jim Garrison. I'm not making any threats. I'm leaving you. I'm taking the kids to my mother's. I am - I am.
Yay! It'll be great! I'll get my shit.
Now. Now! I have to go now. I have to see the frozen Charles! Now! Tonight!
Come up to Boston with me?
Right. Well, I wanted to stop by to welcome you to the uh, to the neighborhood. I'm Claire Spencer. From next door.
Well . . . I better make myself a bit more presentable.
Let's go for a walk down here . . . come on, Mummy!
Isn't it beautiful!
I know that.
But aren't you tired? I can just about manage to stand on my feet! Raimondo!
I'm going with the patrol boat to make a tour around the islands.
I just can't leave without first searching those islands, one by one.
To do what?
What do you want us to do? I don't know myself... But we'll do something.
We've decided to go to Montaldo's place. In fact, Ettore should already be there.
What?
That's a fine way to behave!
Dad, yes. And I'm scared to death of what you must think of me right now.
Wally...
...yes...
I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say.
Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always.
Didn't DEBBIE deserve anymore?
It was a dreadful, heavy thing. I only wore it this once.
But you said you wanted to help -- don't you see what it would mean?
Well, these... women friends of yours... all over the world. How does it work? Do you see some of them again? Do you forget others? Do you write them now and then? How do you manage it?
No.
Long day. Go to sleep.
Good. More coffee? Robert, I hope you don't mind my asking, but I feel like I should.
Sleep all right?
You're not from around here, are you?
I will. And good luck with your show. I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard. You deserve it.
Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
Never mind, it's way too complicated... Did you have problems like this when you were my age - where you're totally confused all the time?
You okay?
And how many people have you killed?
My husband took the car. Will you drive me home?
No.
Thank you.
You don't know?
Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
Really Biff? The keenest?
Well "gee whizz" Biff. I sure am glad you asked me.
You idiot! Asta! Stop that! Get down! Now, stay there.
Grace? Is everything all right? Can we talk?
I don't know
He's in the insurance business.
Can I see him?
We have a baby?
Shelly?
Hey! Oh look.
I still think you're a bastard.
Oh. Right.
Poison gas.
Yes!!
Mrs. Ansel's clothing.
You'd give up what you want for the woman you marry?
Take it.
They're inside.
Don't leave me!
How did it happen?
Father ... Father!
I'm coming.
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.
Don't go anywhere. Stay with me.
Hello, Miss Channing.
My husband...
If you'd only see her, you're her whole life - you must have spotted her by now, she's always there...
I thought you'd forgotten about me.
Not at all. Margo, this is Eve Harrington.
How do you do, my dear.
Oh, brother.
What am I supposed to do?! I saw one of my oldest friends get killed! And I saw who did it! I can't just -- "let it go away"!!
And I'm making mine.
What for?
Peggy, do you know what a penis is? Stay away from it.
I m not worried, Mom. He s still learning our ways...
Fighting s a part of it, Annie. You know that, right?
I don't know what to say to you, except goodbye.
What run him off? Tell me that!
I ain't sure I know that. Baby never laid eyes on her till she showed up here. And how'd she make it and her husband didn't? And where is he? And how she have that baby in the woods by herself? Said a whitewoman help her. Shoot. You believe that? Well, I know what kind of white that was.
Anything white floating around in the woods - if it don't got a shotgun, it's something the Lord tells me I don't want no part of.
I ain't got no friends take a handsaw to their own children.
Are you proposing marriage to me?
Bobo, take the cart away.
But my voices... they promised me...
Some sort of childhood trauma, she thinks. Possible feelings of inadequacy as a chimp. Interesting, huh?
Isn't that cute? I just taught her that.
Seven-ish
They'll understand. Besides I've got a morning appointment tomorrow with Elijah's shrink. We're getting to the bottom of this acid stomach.
Well, why not? Idee of marryin' got you all choked up, trying to pretend you was respectable you was borin' the hell out of all of us.
What are we, an orchestra all of a sudden?
The doctors had your billing address. I'm sorry about the hour.
You must be out of your mind. I've been so happy these last few days -- now you've spoiled it all.
Your wife?
No. We live simply, Mr. Jimmy and I. People come to play bridge. And now and then, young men to swim. You have people, Boone?
A man who is not married has nothing. He is a man of trouble. You need a woman.
Why?
I don't even know him. But I'm having all these fantasies about a man I've never met, who lives in Seattle.
I'd give anything to have this in my house, even for a week.
But when you met her, did you believe she was the only person for you? That in some mystical, cosmic way, it was fated?
No!
To the pan of the supplies boxes --
Of course.
Okay. Great line at the end.
Oh, no--no! My dear Senator --it may be customary out on the prairie to take French leave of people and not be heard of again for five hours--
What?
But?
Just wanted to say good game.
What's up?
I know.
But that was a dumb-ass pass to Toni. Ten seconds left, you run out the clock.
Thanks.
No buts. Took a lot of heart to take that charge.
What's that?
Just one word of advice for next season.
No.
I want to know exactly who you are and what you're really up to!
...Paulie, why didn't you tell me you were bringing him home?! Look at me, I'm not ready for this.
I'm saying you're about as romantic as a bag of sand.
What do you figure it to be?
Paulie, please --
If I could have anything... this would almost do.
I want you to spend some time with me. I want you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
When?
I work too, but I still make time.
Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me?
Thank you, Mr. Sensitive. I'm coming at this wrong... missing something... something...
VB10's an M dwarf; Signa Draconis... too old.
J39 Z186...?
Oh, please, Nick.
Is that what you want?
How do we get out of this room ?
Why?
And they can't fly around out there forever.
What are you gonna do?
I think she has to find out for herself, on her own. We have to allow her space --
He's been hitting it pretty hard. Got high blood pressure, too. I guess it's hard on him, having you around.
Whenever he's got an edge on.
Why would they do all that if we weren't?
I suppose my reluctance was the group aspect of it -- I've never been much of a joiner, although I still consider myself a somewhat religious person --
What are you doing here?
I'd love to.
To the Riviera.
Late for what?
No I Said.
Marcie.
No. I said that.
To what? Trap him?
-- his car. They have it blocked.
You should go back and rest.
Sure thing, Mr. Karpf. C'mon.
The implication being that I have not been reading them as written.
How nice for Lloyd. And how nice for Eve. How nice for everybody.
I thought you might paste them into your book.
I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
No.
I know you will.
I will never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.
Caesar, you don't know shit.
Hey.
Thanks, Mickey, but I need to get out, you know? Get away from all of this.
How'd it go?
Hey.
Goodbye.
Just bought this beautiful antique Ouija.
Who?
I guess you're going to have to chew it off then.
Well, that's what Ryan thought. I was more generous, actually.
Doug, this is Joe White, and this is, this, this is my fiance, Doug Mac...
Diseases.
Better get home before it is.
Major, Major... he's here ...
No thanks, Birdie.
Loud.
Hi. "Well, now Mis' Channin', ah don't think you can rightly say we lost the wah, we was mo' stahved out, you might say - an' that's what ah don' unnerstand about all these plays about love-stahved Suth'n women - love is one thing we was nevah stahved for the South!"
Hi. Hello, darling-
Yeah. God, you showed up at such a weird time in my life.
Goodbye, darling. Don't you dare forget... December 30th.
Yes!
I feel wrong. I feel wrong being here.
I want to go!
I want to go back to Vienna.
Delacroix.
What makes you think he would write a show about the Mau-Mau's.
You don't have the demographics.
Greetings, gents. So let's hear this week's sad story.
Connie and Carlo want you to be godfather to their little boy.
Those boys didn't even know him. You had six whole years of marriage to my Halle Fathered every one of your children. A blessing. I learned hard that a man's just a man, but a son like that...like Halle..now that's somebody.
Oh, I remember bits and pieces of all of'em I guess..Halle, of course..I had Halle a lifetime. Almost twenty years... My two girls, sold and gone before I could even a heard about it, and them without their grown up teeth yet. My third child, my son after Halle...I let that straw boss have me for four months so's I could keep that boy. Next year, he had him traded for lumber anyway and me pregnant with his child. I couldn't love that child. I wouldn't. Not any of the rest either. God take what He would....and He did...
What'd be the point? Not a house in the country ain't packed to the rafters with some dead Negro's grief. We lucky our ghost is a baby. My husband spirit come back? Or yours? Don't talk to me! Ha..You lucky. You got one child left, still pullin at your skirts. Be thankful. I had eight. Eight with six fathers. Every one of them gone from me. Four taken, four chased and all, I expect, worrying somebody's house into evil. My first born - alls I can remember of her now is how she loved the burned bottom of bread. Her little hands..I wouldn't know'em if they slapped me. Can you beat that? Eight children and that's all I remember.
They'll be all right. I'm surprised they lasted here this long.
Ah, winter in Ohio is especially rough if you've got an appetite for color.
I don't want to take you out of your way.
Yeah?
A day like any other. People come, people go.
No, that's okay. Thanks, though.
I want everybody to shut up about Eve. Just shut up about Eve, that's all I want. Give Karen more wine... ... never have I been so happy. Isn't this a lovely room? The Cub Room. What a lovely, clever name. Where the elite meet. Never have I seen so much elite - and all with their eyes on me. Waiting for me to crack that little gnome over the noggin with a bottle. But not tonight. Even Eve. I forgive Eve... there they go.
You're not a stalker or anything, right?
Why did you do that?
Shh . . . ! I'll wait for you upstairs.
I think she would cheer.
Nothing's with me.
Come on sweetie.
"Sleepless in Seattle"?
Don't worry too much about that. Margo just doesn't miss performances. If she can walk, crawl or roll - she plays.
You could always say you have to go the bathroom.
Same with the excerpts I'm choosing: they'll play against any of the images you described.
You'll come up with something.
You could have asked for a favor.
Poor Dad, does that still bother you?
Well don't. You're looking at twenty pounds of high explosive! And if you don't stamp this form I'm going to blow the place up!
I bet you'd like to touch them?
You think these are tits don't you?
Who are you? Let go!
Yeah, that's clerical.
Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging.
Hi.
How?
She's all over him, are you blind?
I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.
Fuck you, Panes.
They're not just our business managers, Panes.
That was a mistake, Juno. Mark is a married stranger. You overstepped a boundary.
I don't know, I just did. And while we were waiting for Vanessa, Mark and I watched The Wizard of Gore and he burned me some CDs of weird music. He's kind of cool.
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?
Naah. I'm already pregnant, so they figure nothing worse could happen to me. I gotta bounce anyway. It was nice seeing you guys again.
Right. Well, Juno, your parents must be wondering where you are. You might want to head home.
You could have sent it to them. Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?
They said they wanted to know about this stuff. They said to keep them updated, so I did!
A couple of hours? Why are you going up there in the first place?
Will you come soon?
Have you seen Walter?
If she's here tomorrow, I'll fucking kill her.
Well, you hire illegals--
You're early... it's not ready. What happened?
Who was that?
Alvy, uh, let's face it. You know something, don't think our relationship is working.
Well, let's see now... If it has my name on it, then I guess it's mine.
Well, uh, Alvy, you wanted to break up just as much as I do.
Just stay in bed and rest.
You were?
What are you, a fry cook or something?
You're not fooling anybody.
You work at Cook's Chicken?
Oh, I've got to give up smoking. Agnes ... wait a minute... Agnes slow down.
Oh, they frighten me, I'm afraid I'll drop them. They have a soft spot on their heads and if you drop them so they land on their heads they become stupid. I was dropped on my head, that's why I don't understand things.
Like what?
Numbers... you can spend your whole life counting and never reach the end.
I don't understand them either. Do you suppose I was dropped on my head?
Knox, you're crazy.
Knox, I don't believe this!
What happens if the bell rings and you're under there?
Oh--that again. Yeah.
Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. Maybe if I saw you once with your hair combed, or something--or--no, no--I don't think even that would do it--
What's this, Diz?
Huh?
No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth is, Diz--there's no man I've seen yet or--must be something wrong with me. I've been feeling low for weeks.
Listen, Captain Cold, the suit, maybe, even though silver went out in the 70's. But those boots are unforgivable. What is it with men?
Are you drunk?
Where've you been? I've got to give evidence in court at nine.
Yes, nice day. ...I've got to go now. Bye-bye.
Hi. Why are you running?
That's quite a change of subject.
Knowing who a person is. Down deep.
Deception isn't something I personally consider sexy.
What do we want?
I have this thing where I have to know a person is being honest with me before, you know, I can feel completely free to be myself.
I think maybe he was scraped on the head by that shot. I don't think he's dead -- just gone somewhere to heal himself.
You won't even tell me your name. What's shocking about a name?
But where are we going, Mr. Crandall?
Don't do that, you've got the whole garage.
...What?
What?
Has he been here?
Colonel!
Oh no! No! Noooo!
Yes.
Kendall Junior is still in surgery, so he won't be available to answer for his name or anything else for another hour -- the cadet we're talking to first is Dunbar.
Senator Jonathan Kendall, of Ohio.
Hurricane knocked out our Mainframe, so all we have are their dogtags. Cadets Raymond Dunbar and Levi Kendall --
Wording and your friendship with the Colonel aside, I'm not comfortable having you involved in this.
No it's okay, I understand, really.
I'm not going to marry him. I just went out with him once. I know! Why don't we go to the movies tonight. Just us girls. It'll be fun.
Cool it kids. He's free to see other girls, if he wants.
You should have taken better care of me, you know? You've been away a long time. Four years. Say something.
That's right. Always spying, always judging. Everyone's laughing at you, you fucking pussy. You let Diego fuck you in the ass. Maybe you are a fucking faggot. You must be fucking Diego because you're not fucking me.
My problem? We're broke, that's my fucking problem. And you're a fucking spy.
Fuck you, George, just fucking drive.
That loud mouthed little bitch
Why on earth would they want a nitwit to be president?
That smart?!
So if you know everything about Hudsucker, tell me why the Board decided to make Norville Barnes president.
Yeah, yeah. Say, you won't tell anyone about me, will you?
Oh. Well, what are you going to do? You have to go to school, honey. I mean, what --
But -- who are you -- what d'you do here?
Come on. What's with you and Michael?
You are forcing me to do the very thing you know I fear most!
Duty?! You talk about duty?!
I'm fine. Kind of tired.
I'm glad.
That's something I suppose.
I don't want to go to Vanderbilt.
I know.
Yes?
It's just as I thought.
Let's go.
Are you really that brave?
Wait - are you accusing me? You're not serious. I can't... Mr. McAllister, we have worked together on SGA for three solid years and... I mean, I can't believe it. I'm... I'm shocked!
If it's about the posters, I think it's so awful. It's a travesty.
I was. So? Mr. Pecharda let me in. As you know, with all my responsibilities I often come in on the weekend and have permission to do so. But I left very early, around 6:30.
Mr. M., I am running on my qualifications. I would never need to resort to, you know, to vandalism like a, you know... Plus, my own best banner was torn down. Did I do that too?
Oh. That's alright. Then I'll come back at a better time. What would be a better time?
I don't. I just know they were there when I left. I'm giving you helpful information is all. You know, instead of wasting time interrogating me, we should be out there trying to find out who did this.
So, it's a big country with a free press. You can go work somewhere else.
Am I lying? Are you sure? Are you absolutely sure I'm lying? Then explain to me about the jellyfish. Earlier. Why did we see jellyfish? Harry doesn't fear jellyfish. You do. They're your fear, aren't they?
So you didn't do it after all.
It was God's will.
Is there no chance?
He wants the entire roof taken off and lowered.
Latitude 47 degrees.
If he tricked me into loving him, is what I meant.
Hello?...Duncan...The Ad Agency's already there?...I'm out the door... Ben! Knock it off! It's gonna go beautifully... Damn it Ben --
Well look, I know that all you care about is your precious mini-bike. It's obvious you have no sense of historical perspective, I think we're here.
Yes, Mister McMurphy?
That music is for everyone, Mister McMurphy.
Mister McMurphy, there are old men here who couldn't hear the music at all if it were lower. That music is all they have, and I wish you wouldn't lean against the glass there, your hands are staining the window.
Not at all, Mister McMurphy...
Well, okay - thank you, Detective.
Absolutely. Long as she can keep it. Isn't that right, James...
Alright starve.
Oh-oh. HOLLY ...and his wife's, uh, in and out of institutions. She's schizophrenic.
Why?
This is a bad day for me.
I'd better get back to my elevator. I don't want to be fired.
I just don't want you and Cheeba to get hurt.
Bert Williams and the rest, they had to black up. They had no choice. They were considered 3 5ths of a human being. Did you know that's written in the Constitution of the United States?
Maybe you need to start.
You don't read, do you?
Y'know, at the beginnin' of the century, African-American had to perform in blackface. You ever heard of Bert Williams? He was a great artist.
What is it?
What I'm saying. But you still come out this goofball romantic.
You're some piece of work, you know that. Just calmly backstroking around in the big toilet bowl, and somehow you never let it touch you. I mean, between Vice and this so- called occupation you're in now, you must've seen it all.
What's that? Present from Faith?
Yep.
Sometimes she's terrific...
Hi.
Yah.
Okaaaay.... That car's going to bankrupt you.
That is so--weird that you name your car.
I can't find my ball.
Should I hit it?
Naomi, I guess.
You go first. Let me watch how to do this.
I think I should talk to my agent, Marty, you and I should, we should, really not discuss...
He's on the Island, he'll be back on...
Why do you love me?
And I really don't know your noises yet.
Okay... I will...
Sometimes I can't tell at all, what's going through that head of yours.
That's why you never liked me. I'm different from you. Well, everything's different now, so it doesn't matter. So there.
Tell me the truth. You had to get married, didn't you? Because of me.
Stay here? Is that necessary?
I wanted some fresh air, Robert. How is Mr. Gardiner?
Look, John what we're handing them are platitudes. Things they've heard a million times: "Love thy neighbor," "Clouds have silver linings," "Turn the other cheek." It's just a
Oh sure... Gotta believe in God. But I don't think God made man in his own image. No. 'Cause most of... the bullshit that happens, is because of men. No, I think man was made out of the devil's image and women were created out of God -- because women can have babies which is sorta like creating, and which also explains why women are attracted to men, because, lets face it, the devil is a helluva lot more interesting -- I slept with a few saints and let me tell you... Booooorring!!!... And so the whole point of life, I think, is for men and women to get married so the devil and God can live together and, ya know -- work it out... ... Not that we have to get married.
Jesus, what happened to you?
NO!
Cherry-red Tears, your first book. I read it at least nine times. And then I found out you were going to attend some kind of book fair.
Guilt?
Nothing?
I remember.
Cat, you tie onto this manifold. There's some tanks on the other side; I'm gonna go check them out.
Yeah? Well I'm not.
Yes.
You should feel lucky. Ed's the only guy in town who doesn't pass judgment on people.
Yes.
But why?
Nothing LESLIE - I just think we should wait...
I'm leaving. Is that alright with you? Do I have your permission? Maybe you want to think about it.
Oh. Well, yes. It's extraordinary. You think you could sign it for us?
I can't. It's all too much.
Go on. You can do it.
Thank you.
Charlie! Am I dead?
Harry.
His name is John Book.
He's at a home out here.
I have to go.
I'm sorry to say I know what you're saying.
Yes?
Yes --?
Okay...
You shouldn't smoke.
How did you know my name was Sarah?
Why?
What time is it?
I lied. When I'm drunk I lie.
Oh ... excuse me. There's Nicholas.
Take it easy, John Doe.
Johnnie hits on anything in high heels.
I gotta go. I'll see you at work. Walter, you scared me. Don't ever do that again.
Who's Linda?
I didn't want him meeting me here.
So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us.
Lucky you.
I'm not gonna let that happen.
Well,then I have spoiled your dinner -- "your food won't digest, and your wine will sour."
Good-bye, darling. I'll only be gone until three.
Jimmy just stood there on the sidewalk. It felt funny. I started walking down the block, but I noticed the stores were empty.
Who's Baxter?
I got seared.
Claire.
It's fine.
He has ways of communicating, Robert. I can tell when he's expressing approval or disapproval, just from his eyes...
Is that what you think--
I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died.
Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back. I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid.
You don't love me.
Do I really feel like... I am...?
It was obvious from the way he first looked at me.
I'm glad.
I'm going to be elected governor. And the first thing I'm going to do -
Let him finish, Charles.
In case you don't know, Emily, this - this gentleman - is -
Oh!!
You're a cheap, crooked grafter - and your concern for your children and your mother -
She insulted me!
Toi. They've been 'going out' for two weeks.
I'll take it. And then what?
'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here...
No, you're not. But a presence in your house is not something to be taken lightly.
As you may know, 'going out' in the six grade doesn't mean shit. They don't actually go to a movie or anywhere, they don't even eat lunch together, it's just a declaration to the world that they're...
No. Tell me what you want to say.
Don't worry about the damn phone. I won't answer it.
...going out, yeh. I had kids of my own, once.
Jesus. And last week you came over with blood on your shoes. What am I going to do with you?
Louie!
THEN TURN OFF THE CARTOON!
I said...
...I'm not deaf, y'know.
In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you...held you so ti-ight...
Sugar. I was slow dancing to that song before Rachel was even born.
It won't hurt.
Don't you worry about me. I'm Charles Foster Kane. I'm no cheap, crooked politician, trying to save himself from the consequences of his crimes -
I don't know--you just are. Leaving a light for Plato. That was nice.
I'm sorry I sent for you, Brad - I didn't -
Hi.
There is nothing you can say that will surprise me.
I have brought you your clothes. All I ask is that you get dressed and go. We are having a guest for breakfast.
No you are not. You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash. You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child. "Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director..." English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway.
His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic.
But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic.
Ha! Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel.
Why are you doing this?
Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut.
Not nice. Not kind.
I hate sucking dick!
No, Sandro, please... I ask you as a favor...
Promise that you won't try to look for me... you shouldn't try to look for me any more...
Hey, I was only kidding!
Yes you do. We were calling you Gay Boy and you got so mad....
The cheese...
If you ask me... I'll say, "yes."
Oh, God...
Oh, Lord....
It's me.
You didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba. What can I do for you?
I think it started in the wind. Money - arms, big oil, Pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like L.B.J. were committed to a war in Southeast Asia. As early as '61 they knew Kennedy was going to change things... He was not going to war in Southeast Asia. Who knows? Probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere - Houston, New York - hell, maybe Bonn, Germany... who knows, it's international now.
Uh huh.
Don't say that.
Could we salt them, or smoke them, do you think?
Well, where are you --
No.
It looks a bit fishy to me.
This is your bedroom?
Never mind.
Our Steven not only disguises himself.
But you don't even know me. How can you care what I do with whom?
Do you want to talk about doing crazy things.
He goes to the theater armed.
You need a COAT!
I hate tears.
Monsieur Rick, I --
You forget where I work?
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist. He and my mom got divorced when I was five. She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona...
You should have seen this octopus furnace. I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get up in there...
Alright, this is some of the things they wrote me; "Glad I finally met you", "You always seemed nice", "Wish I could have known you more"...
...I know this must look... funny.
They're just fun to read.
Barton. You see, Barton, I'm not just Bill's secretary Bill and I are... I love. We-
Are you married?
My car! My car! Tan Ciera!
One of you must be mistaken.
Hello, Brad.
Stanford. I'm leaving in June after I graduate.
He'll kill us.
I don't know.
It's too late...
I know.
You're not using it today?
All right. We'll dance.
Stop it, Alvy!
Have caviar if you like, but it tastes like herring to me.
Don't know why I did. I told you, I don't know where he is.
If we leave the remembering to historians then the struggle is already lost. Everyone must have a memory, everyone needs to be a historian. In this country, for example, we're in danger of losing hard-won freedoms by dozing off in a perpetual present.
I might.
Oh. Right. And you're in--?
The Longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this Saturday, you just watch. We got a kid at tailback from down your way--outta El Indio--
Thank you, sir.
Yes, sir.
Well, Daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and I'll fly to the Cowboy away games when they're in the Conference. Then there's the high school on Friday' nights. West Side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. High school, we're talkin'. Guess how much he can bench-press?
You too.
I'm not sure I'll be able to...I...
Okay, great -- good luck.
Benjamin -- I am getting pretty tired of all this suspicion. Now if you won't do me a simple favor I don't know what.
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop acting that way and bring me the purse?
Will you bring it in to me?
All right. Put it in the room where we were.
Yes.
Oh, yes! Where's mine? I want to look like you.
It's a pity she couldn't make it up here today.
You're showing how superior you are to your subject. TOBY No, but I like my subject. I like these people.
You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
I could stay here forever...
You would.
This'll be great in my report, my mother was suspended for smoking.
Hello.
Thanks, but I have my own now.
Yeah.
Want to hear some music?
This is Harry, Phil, Grammoo and Vada Sultenfuss...
I think so too...
I'm not just selling the script. I'm selling me. DeMille always said I was his greatest star.
DeMille is Leo. I'm Scorpio. Mars has been transmitting Jupiter for weeks. Today is the day of greatest conjuction. Now turn around. Let me dry you.
I live here.
What happened? Who're you?
What?
Sure we are, let's go!
I can't open it.
What do you want?
You put me life in danger.
Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose?
Yes, sir.
So do I.
She isn't here. And I'm sorry, but Mr. Hillyer doesn't want her to have callers during working hours.
I said she isn't here. NOW you go home. Be a nice boy and go home.
That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away.
Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon.
Now I become custody of police department?
But even if you get your revenge, you won't remember it. You won't even know it's happened.
Tell me about her again.
All the adulation? It makes you feel like a fake, doesn't it?
He did.
Since you are a friend of my daughter's, I think I'm entitled to call you James, don't you think?
You didn't marry Donna Reed.
Butch called.
How was your tour?
It's me, Yuri.
No.
No.
This won't do. Not during business hours . . .
Are you here to take Shelly back?
...That's awful. I hope you killed, that asshole?
How was it?
Someone's got to do it.
I still don't either, even after all these years.
It's complicated, but in a way, your father let me know how I'd get through to him.
How?
He just said...that I'd shock Eugene and then things would change for him.
I don't understand.
I was working with a boy named Eugene.
Just a little, when we were looking up information about William's father. How did he help?
I was going to back the car to the ridge and pull you up.
My husband apologises for not joining us. It's not too cold for you, Mr. Penfield?
Gideon, don't say things like that.
Yeah.
It starts like this... fire... that spreads. Starts in my head. Then moves to my stomach. Then it goes lower. I can stop it sometimes but mostly I just jump on and ride it out... then everything'll go back to normal, you know. Only thing ever took that feeling away was... was... when I met Ronnie. Cuz I love him so much. He's all I got in my life that's special. And I like taking care of him and helping him when he gets nervous. When I can do that for him... it's like I'm givin' somethin' of myself that I haven't givin' nobody else.
Hey.
That's a dumb thing to say.
Just take it.
Tell me what?
Good. Suez was a minefield for both parties.
Are you a carpenter, Mr. Rieper? HERBERT shakes his head.
It'll only take a second.
...And he called the reporters --
You would leave me for Armand if he beckoned you.
I apologized, I offered to help.
Times have changed.
Oh, you mean my pigeons.
I forgot I had it on.
It's early yet.
What do you mean?
And you were told to destroy those?
And ...?
How come you didn't say anything when you found these things?
I don't care.
Let go of my arm...
Of course I have.
Would you let me ride your horse?
What makes it different, Robert?
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO WITH IT?
WHY?
You won't be made to feel! Period. You've carved out this little part for yourself in the world where you get to be a voyeur, a hermit and a lover whenever you feel like it and the rest of us are just supposed to feel so incredibly grateful for the brief time you've touched our lives! Well, go to hell! It isn't human not to feel lonely -- it isn't human not to afraid! You're a hypocrite and you're a phony!
I'm engaged for the evening.
She'll be all right?
Where's Mr MacCarron?
She's my daughter.
She's my sister.
Katherine.
Nicholas, okay... you're not about to shoot anyone...
You know I love spaghetti.
That's fine with me... Get it? Fine. A fine! Hey c'mon, c'mon, what is this, an audience or a jury?
No, I couldn't get my hands on one.
Who's writing this guy's lines?
Why, certainly. I wanted to get a peek at his face...
I never saw him. Why didn't he show up?
Addison, just a few minutes ago. When I told you this would be a night to remember - that it would bring me everything I wanted-
Okay -- for you.
Sure, I'll give you the name of a doctor. ...And I don't want to examine you.
Then why do you keep running away?
What are you so scared of?
Thank you.
Come on.
Benjamin -- you've known me all your life.
You hear all kinds of things.
You think?
Find out.
Certainly, Mr. deWitt...
I'm going to try to do better.
I'm sorry I couldn't go with you to Missy's funeral. And that I blew up when we went to that silly animal graveyard.
Not by me, it isn't. I know how badly I acted, how unfair I was. It's just that I..you know.
That's not true. The subject scares me. Because of Zelda.
What is it? I'm busy.
No, I don't think so. That's someone else.
Ex...ex, ex...
Honestly Harry, he got the mustang, I promise.....
People have been asking me about that story in the paper. I told them you were the first person on the scene. They were asking me for all the details.
Hey, Juno. Juno! Look at this one.
The money. You don't know where it came from?
Why.
Why you have to go out there.
That's the nature of all progress, William. Don't let your brother sway you otherwise.
I just wondered.
Give me that child before you fill his head with drivel!
Is it the money?
Okay, I got it.
What shit, honey?
The real estate lady left, she couldn't wait anymore. What took you?
That's what makes you interesting. As a teacher.
Please!
What difference does that...
John, where are we g --
You do. Seem to. Have passion. In the classroom.
It's very good. I understand you won the Booker Prize.
What does he say to do?
Oh!
Uh, gee. Would you like to have lunch? Uh, uh...
Okay, and listen, I would like to hear what made you suddenly decide to drop out of life.
I'm sorry about the presents. I got a little carried away.
There isn't any us.
Disney! How inter...
That's your dog.
I refilled the Zyprexa and Atavan...
You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie.
Is something the matter?
I know things... like who you can trust. Like that your brother was in on it from the beginning.
But you're troubled... aren't you?
Mr. President, I'd like you to meet my dear friend, Mr. Chauncey Gardiner.
Yes?
She made it through S.E.R.E. training. Got a call this morning from --
I know she must be a really passionate person.
Lucy and I kept talking, and I didn't realize how late it had gotten.
And you're unhappy.
But what about...
We saw each other a little while ago.
No... in the hut.
Curious? That's funny, I'm feeling a bit curious myself right now.
Maybe I'll see you again sometime, huh?
Curious, maybe.
You seem uncomfortable. Do I make you nervous, Corky?
My mother?
You said you'd call my father.
You took care of your wife, like you do me?
When? Now? Oh. No.
Of course.
A key party?
It's not a bother.
Fuck!
Dinner in ten minutes.
No, thanks, I can manage.
Yes. And I've accepted.
I said to him Cary you're being ridiculous. You're more than half her age. He said no one had ever been that honest with him and he falls in love with me.
Please. That's all I need.
You don't know how crazy I am.
You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
I've got troubles.
Wanna kiss me, Jim?
You're terrible.
Not another bill?
...the Harvester...
Oh, those are only local. Wait'll they start pouring in from all over the country.
Second drawer.
Must have been tickled pink.
Contributions from boys who read about your camp.
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
"...but still it rises up...It rises up, Frank, high as it can go."
This scene is why I'm doing the movie. "Look at the mill, Frank -- look at the way it goes around...half of the time the darned wheel's under water, but..."
But for how long - what will set you off again? You'll be walking down the street and some girl will be wearing a white hat - and that will be it - back on the merry go round...
You working?
Yeah, but I feel like I fit in for the first time, you know? Like I just held them far away from me, and they did the same to me.
Yeah, but that's an old story, you don't want to hear it.
That's not fair.
We took care of that.
That's okay. You seem pissed off all the time, though.
The terms are too high. Unconditional surrender.
8 days and we bring it back home....
I wish it were.
I told you, I'm good at this.
A satellite dish?
I lived with you. You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. Isn't that a terrible thing? Isn't that sad?
I'm too tired not to go out with you.
Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
Everything's too hard. Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.
Your painful groin?
No, I think you look... fine.
Well...
No, not really.
You play an instrument?
Oh, I like it. I like it very much.
He'll be gone for his birthday.
I love you.
Jon, if I'm not there, he will be tipped off. I'll get rid of Jamie -- but you and I are in this together.
Let's see.
They'll in validate the key. Probably nothing.
This is the first time I've seen him in years. I didn't want him to think I was high-hatting him.
No, thank you -- what's your name?
What about you? Doesn't all of this shake your faith at all?
Kiss my ass.
I want you out now
I guess I would've felt sorry for the universe.
Who is it?
You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you.
Didn't want to miss anything.
These ones coming up are getting stupider every year.
Maybe you're just getting less patient.
No, I'm leavin' this mornin', back up to Brainerd.
Must have been my cheap-ass answering machine. It was always messing up.
I don't know.
If you....if you go back on sedation, you won't feel the same way about me. You'll report me for drug evasion.
You should have called. I have an "O- chem" lab due tomorrow and it's impossible. It's not an excuse dummy. I want to go out with you. But look:
Here you are, Maxie dear. One good burp and you'll be rid of that Miss Caswell...
I love you, Max. I really mean it. I love you. Come to the pantry.
Everybody has a heart - except some people. Of course I've got bicarb. There's a box in the pantry. We'll put your name on it. Max Fabian. It'll say there. Always. Just for you.
Poor Max. Heartburn? It's that Miss Caswell. I don't know why she doesn't give Addison heartburn.
Miss Caswell? What?
I was half hoping I wouldn't have a good time tonight. You know why?
Yes.
That was with Edward. She's accustomed to his world. Stargher's mind is unfamiliar territory. She's "lost." Someone has to go in. Remind her what's really happening. And get her out. Until then, she's at his mercy.
Oh let's see -- wait a minute, well, I can think of two reasons.
Linda.
It just seems...kind of weird.
What do you mean 'outgrown it'?
It would make me feel like a human being instead of a cynical, hardbitten newswoman. Besides it wouldn't be a bad story, would it, "Newswoman Saves Suicide?"
The one good lesson he taught me, Louis. Never drink from the dead.
... Evening, Chance.
... The Old Man is getting weaker, Chance.
I'm afraid he's slippin' a bit with every hour that goes by...
Piece of cake.
Like muddy waters?
Where did you learn that?
We're hundreds of miles from where you have to be.
Why can't we wait here for a ride?
Where are you going?
No, he's not.
I did what you told me to.
'Cause you always tell me the right thing to do.
Sure did.
You were wonderful.
I'm saying no--and thank you.
Thank you, Herb. You're a wonderful man. You really are. Everybody respects you for what you've done for scouting and the Little League.
I'm sorry.
I don't know if that's absolutely necessary.
Don't say anything about anything.
Hi, again. Sorry about...
It's... it's not that simple to explain. I know you think it is, but it's not. The truth is, I don't really know what I want to do. I don't have all the answers.
No, you just act like you do.
We offer the English a last chance to return home in peace. If they refuse, we recross the river and attack them here -- at the Tourelles.
That's not true! Whatever problems your father and I are having, have nothing to do with this.
You're amazing! You act like I don't live in that house! Don't you think I hear the two of you!? Don't you think I can tell what's going on? I'm not five years old, Mom! You want to divorce Daddy and Daddy doesn't want to.
I don't believe this!
You just want to get away from Daddy and you're using me to do it!
That's not true!
Then why do you want to leave?
Did he tell you that?
He doesn't have to! It's, like, so obvious you can't stand him.
Hello Peter, so good to see you.
So you found Peter...
Will you live here?
No.
Yes, that makes a lot of sense, Earl.
How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
"Production for use only." Well, maybe that's the answer.
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
What are your beliefs, Earl?
Uh-huh.
Yeah.
Where to?
Sporty.
That sounds good.
You teach them!
Narcissus!
You're not going! You have to stay with us!
No!
Your daughters need more than some vapors; they need you!
I don't want you to die!
But she is not an enigma Mother. Everything that Agnes has done is explainable from modern psychiatry. One, two, three, right down the line.
She is an innocent.
But what you are choosing to believe is a lie because you won't face the fact that she was raped... or seduced... or that she did the seducing.
But I want the opportunity to believe. I want the choice to believe.
There's a tunnel out of the crypt into the barn. Did you know about that? There's an answer Mother. That's how she got out.
Then why are you so obsessed with her? You're losing sleep over her? You're thinking about her all the time. You're bent on saving her. Why?
That's what I have to believe...
That's what you believe she is? The sum of her psychological parts?
Somebody told her.
That's crazy. How could she find out about it?
Mr. McMurphy, you had no right to take these men out with you!
No, it was irresponsible!
What?
Yeah. What a day.
...I'm here, aren't I? Wouldn't miss a loose end meeting. What's on the table for discussion? Party favors, flowers -- hi Dad, hi Drew --
But you said the other --
Do you feel, um...are you disenchanted with our marriage?
Are you angry with me?
Yeah, but I...uh--I thought you needed that. When-when-when we met, you said your life was chaos.
It lets a crazy man into our lives.
That's their explanation. You might not believe me...
I don't want to be a fool!... I want to look them in the eye and say, I know!
For Christ's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.
Don't go in, Ryan.
Count on it.
Not as a rule.
Hm. You think we should ask them for their landscaper?
I remember every minute of that party.
Look, that's back when I hated you.
I can never keep them all straight - was she the super-bitch?
There's my dad with Joanie.
I've been looking all over for this.
You lent it to me in like tenth grade.
What a little hosebag.
Look at how cute I am!
No, she was the second wife. The third one was the super-bitch - Maxine. There! Look at her!
There.
We'll pray that he doesn't die! But if he does, then we'll find a way so no one knows!
You heard about Julia Wolf?
I saw her.
Homey.
Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
Then why did you quit?
With a milk pail in one hand and a marriage license in the other.
Why didn't you say you wanted to get married back in Aspen. I told the man in Sonora there were four of us. If only three show up, he might call the whole deal off. We've got to stick together. Like we've always done.
I thought it had a lot of merit.
Thanks.
Oh -- work!!
Who doesn't?
Can you? I'm happy being a dealer. At least the punters keep their hands to themselves.
I got scared.
Ah, we all say that. But if we hate it, why do we do it?
Well it is. But I know where I am.
I've been watching you work. You're the best in the place. But you know that.
Splendid! Is he sick?
Maybe it wasn't a specific moment, maybe it--
What does it mean? I... I mean we, you have other tactics...
Guess that makes you pretty special.
Yayyy!
No. Oh, Richard, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but, but you, you are our last hope. If you don't help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca.
Please. Please listen to me. If you knew what really happened, if you only knew the truth --
It was your cause, too. In your own way, you were fighting for the same thing.
Jesus. We've been at this for six months.
And you haven't made an ounce of progress.
But you said you have the worst reputation.
You feel violated?
I am irate!
Money.
Thirty dollars.
She's got it.
Oh, I'm sure I can.
The ideas you get in your head.
That'd be something.
That's eight years of school and training -- after college. And all that doesn't necessarily make you a better human being.
But if it doesn't happen, grab for something within reach. Life's tough enough without causing yourself disappointment --
It's a disgusting process. You haven't missed anything.
I never really...went through a... dating period.
Well, don't say it like that. It's not so...ya know, crazy an idea. You are a healthy woman... You hold a steady job. Ya not crossed eyed or anything...
Do I look like I have someone special?
Fine.
Well, there's nobody special!
What?
I mean, it's not easy in this day and age.
Tell me about it. I've been dating longer than I've been driving. I can't believe that.
Meeting ... people.
Maybe now. It was different back then. I had this place, I was doing all the shopping, all the cooking. What do I need some chulo with grease under his nails to drink up the profit?
Nobody's too busy.
I don't mean Fernando.
How come you never got married again?
A little older than Paloma is now.
I was too busy.
I never said that.
John...
Here I am lecturing you. Have some p t .
Henry told Cyrus he'd kill him if he ever showed his face around our house again. When Henry makes a threat like that, people tend to take him seriously.
I have someone I want you to meet.
Can't you stop it?
I hate the storm. I hate it!
I want to be a teacher.
No, Mother, he's lying...
I'm sorry. I don't usually read private cigarette cases.
I should have let him kill you.
I knew I couldn't trust you.
It was all so crazy--the day after the break-in he gave us a speech, bouncing up and down on his heels in that loony way of his--Gordon told us not to let Jim McCord ruin everything--don't let one bad apple spoil the barrel, he said. You just know that when Gordon Liddy's calling someone a bad apple, something's wrong somewhere. ...It's all so rotten... and getting worse... and all I care about is Hugh Sloan. His wife was going to leave him if he didn't stand up and do what was right. And he quit. He quit because he saw it and didn't want any part of it.
--omigod, there was so much of it, six million came in one two-day period-- six million cash, we couldn't find enough places to put it. I thought it was all legal, I guess I did, til after the break-in, when I remembered Gordon got so much of it.
Are you going to kiss me?
Are you afraid of heights?
John!
He's...what? Say again? We're in cell hell...
If this is a joke, it's not funny.
Did you say Dmitri? How do you know about my case? I don't understand...
...okay, Max, I believe you...I'll get out of the building...
In my office?
I don't want to see your hospital.
At least kiss me when you do that.
You always said, the field uphill needs a rest, but if you think --
Jabez -- you ought to talk to Tom about joining the Grange.
It's all right, Jabez. We'll find something to pay Stevens.
Jabez! Couldn't you take a sack of seed instead?
I guess not.
Yes, I have. I will.
No.
Because that's how Cynthia thinks!! All she does is think about that stuff, and I hate that, I don't want to be like her, I don't want to be like her!!
You did? I love him. Yeah, you know, I'm thinking of moving to New York.
You do not!
Did you manage to find good rooms?
And here's Sandro. Why don't you two go upstairs and change?
Quieter? Oh, yes, of course.
Shouldn't we try to find a quieter place?
Good morning, sir.
Yes, they are.
No, they don't talk... We talk to them.
Oh, you're pretty...
Have you heard of a French film called La Collectionoose ?
But...
Well, shoot it on the last day.
Listen, Viktor... I want to talk to you now, not as Elaine, studio head, but Elaine, ex-wife. Second ex-wife. You got lucky this last time but you need to be careful. We both know you wouldn't be making this overblown art film of you hadn't convinced Simone to be in it.
I'll walk you out.
Experience, Viktor. I've seen this a hundred times -- young stars destroying the very people who discovered them. I'm worried about you, that's all. This woman -- she controls your destiny.
Do you want to go around by the old road?
We'll call it uncontested or whatever. I just want out.
I want out of this marriage.
I drove around. Then I went to talk with Graham.
Yeah.
You have a lot of brothers and sisters?
I bet you have a great family.
How was that?
You grew up around here?
I'm proud of this play. It's so different from anything you've done.
What the hell does that mean? Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life. I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being.
What kind of a family is this... are we human beings? He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo. He heard Connie.
... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden. And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'?
He's not the same as when I met him.
That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom. It's not your best side.
Utah? I thought you'd be going to New York or Paris. What's in Utah?
This is so over-the-top and fucked-up I can hardly stand it.
Shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.
Now you must really shut the fuck up, please. Shut The Fuck Up.
I have to go.
I won?
I'm not scaring you, am I Norman? I hope I'm not frightening you. The last thing I want to do is frighten you. You feel okay, don't you?
Is it my turn again?
Where is he?
I love you Jack, you know that.
You were a croupier there? You never told me that. I thought you just knew some gamblers.
450? What did you do, just walked in and said I want to be a croupier? Don't you need training?
You sold the car. You got a job. What's the third thing? Tell me.
Where's Joe?
I shouldn't have put you through that. It must have been agony. Let's do something.
For everyone.
Will this work?
No, I'm not. I'm looking at you.
No, I'm not.
Hey. You okay, Flea?
I'm not interested in him.
Jake, c'mon now. Don't start.
Oh. Cahoon. Yeah, he's--good.
No no. Don't do that. Don't say that if you don't...
Look, just in case this weekend becomes next month and next month becomes... whatever... Don't make a joke of your life. Go back and read what you wrote. You're better than the rest of them, better than the Bob Sugars, and don't forget it.
You better bring him home, if you really love him. Don't kill love. You'll regret it for the rest of your life.
Liar!
I love you, Nick...
Hear what?
What?
What, by putting it in a fuckin' script, for everyone to see?! What kind of sick mind would operate like that?
Shit. Shit. I know it's here. Hold on.
Milo, you --
And what about this so-called "Barbara" character? It's obviously ME! I'm so embarrassed! This is our life!
Hi. I've been looking for an envelope of my receipts from last month and I'm thinking I didn't take them with me. Have you seen them around?
I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...
We'll talk some other time.
Don't worry. I'll respect you afterwards.
Now what on earth would give you an idea like that?
I went down to Concord to check it out. The president is Mel Gordon. The vice-president and treasurer is Gordon LaRiviere. Those boys are buying up the mountain, Wade. 364,000 this year. I believe that's out of LaRiviere's league.
About Jack? No. Have you checked out the tax bill on your father's farm lately?
Has anybody offered to buy it?
This is from three years ago. Some difference, huh?
It's really not a good idea for me to be seen with you.
I gotta go.
Jesus, that's beautiful.
You'll be clean and we'll be rich.
If he runs, everyone will assume he took the money.
He'll have to run.
Caesar, I know Johnnie. It was him. I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed them. I knew you were going to be upset so I thought I'd apologize and give Gino the Scotch. I honked a couple of times but he didn't stop.
It was him. I'm positive.
Did they ever find out who they were?
Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
Welcome home, John.
It's a piece.
But I want you to do it, I want somebody who will ask the right questions and everything, somebody I can play to and feel safe because you can't do anything.
Me? You're the one who... ! Shit!
They'll learn to live with it.
Why wait?
Maybe I blocked it out.
Oh yeah?
It doesn't bother me either.
...I suppose.
Let me come and talk to you.
Yes, sir.
I'll marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.
Margo!
When? When are you going to do it?
What are you going to wear?
But you have treated me that way.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
What about Samuel? Will you come back to take him to trial?
Then do it the way you want.
Anything I'd know?
Oh yeah? What kind of stuff?
You are not.
That's hilarious. You sound just like one of those guys.
Okay.
If I had I wouldn't have gone in.
All I mean is... someone like you...
God, I can't keep up with all your changes.
It's so hard to believe.
It's amazing, you know, that a drug could change things like that, destroy a life and then give it back. It's hard to believe that the world could be so hellish on day and like heaven the next.
What's gotten into you?
I wasn't.
So how're you doing?
Thanks. Um, this is Ken Cortland, my husband.
So ... ?
Yeah, he's good that way. Very considerate.
No, she was just sitting there?!
Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go --
Oh but why "alas?"
Anon, good nurse. Anon. Master Shakespeare?!
Alas indeed, for I thought you the highest poet of my esteem and a writer of plays that capture my heart.
You don't talk about those things. Not yet.
He's impossible. He won't eat. And because he won't eat, he gets weaker. And because he's weaker, he doesn't want to eat.
He's up with your father.
I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again!
Start back up the Waterford Sentinel. Town newspaper. Show you the plans...
Dave.
Did you know Dave's a bed wetter?
Sure.
Well, that's all. You will see. Today, tomorrow, inna week, he's gonna say to you, "Hey, Ma, it's no good being a single man. I'm tired-a running around." Then he's gonna say, "Hey, Ma, wadda we need this old house? Why don't we sell this old house, move into a nicer parta town? A nice little apartment?"
I don't sell this house, I tell you that. This is my husband's house. I had six children in this house.
You will see. A coupla months, you gonna be an old lady, sleeping onna couch in her daughter-in-law's house.
Were the lights on?
Oh sure. This girl is a college graduate.
They're the worst. College girls are one step from the streets. They smoke like men inna saloon. My son Joseph, his wife, you know, she types onna typewriter. One step from the streets, I tell you. Mrs. Pilletti ponders this philosophy for a moment.
That's the first time Marty ever brought a girl to this house. She seems like a nice girl. I think he has a feeling for this girl. You heard him sing. He been singing like that all morning.
Dad, in a million years, I would never give him a pen. What's wrong with having some fun? I like him.
I'm assuming you read my deposition.
Hi.
Pretty ironic, huh? I had to go all the way to the center of the galaxy... Just to find you.
So. I'm assuming they sent you here to administer last rites?
Stop. You're making me insecure.
Mister McMurphy, patients are not permitted to run around in towels.
On this ward?
Oh, I had them removed.
Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
Steve...what you tried to do today...you tried to take me up on a high mountain...I couldn't go all the way...I failed you... Will you forgive me? Have I lost you, Steve? Have I...?
I know.
And you feel like you're being ripped open inside.
The pain. The fucking pain!
He also said Crow was a fake.
I didn't bleed.
Did you bleed?
I mean it -- You leave everything to me -- I'm going to be your own personal dating service!
I'm totally serious!
What about her? Would you go out with her?
Mark my words, by the end of this summer you'll be up to your neck in pussy!
But putting that aside for now, would you go out with her?
You should never wish to get melodramatic over anything.
Yes, you're right. I'm sick and tired of being like that.
Now, listen. For God's sake, try not to let yourself become obsessed with that idea. Go to your room and get back into bed.
Just several days ago, the thought of Anna being dead would have made me sick. And now, I don't even cry, I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so damned simple and easy, even to deprive one's self of pain and suffering.
My Jesus
No, no....no, you see...I never loved him. I never loved him, Earl. When I started, when I met him, I met him and I fucked him and I married him because I wanted his money, do you understand? I'm telling you this now...this I've never told anyone...I didn't love him. And now....I know I'm in that will, I know, I was there with him, we were all there together when we made that fucking thing and all the money I'II get -- I don't want it -- Because I love him so much now...I've fallen in love with him now, for real, as he's dying, and I look at him and he's about to go, Alan, he's dead...he's moments... I took care of him through this, Alan. And What Now Then?
I blew it, Dr. Lester.
Tom -- I've been trying to get you all afternoon--
All right, Tom -- it's true. I know it's true.
Don't tell me what to do! We're divorced -- I'm a free woman. You're not my husband and you're not my boss! And what's more, you're not going to be my boss.
What?!!
Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind keeping quiet long enough for me to tell you what I came up here for?
I have a lunch date. I just want --
No, I can't.
Is everything ok?
How do I know next time you're feeling neglected or whatever, you're not going to run around on me? If we're going to be together I have to be able to trust you.
Here are some blankets. This is a good song, this is a really good song.
You sound like an artist.
We move. Place to place.
I don't know. Everything's so neat. It's all just so...goddamn dear. Damn!
Steve, I...
Give it back to him.
We'll find him.
But that's not true! I've got one.
I need my sodding parents' consent.
I don't know. These things take time.
I found these. The others are still in storage.
Fine. You'll get them, Evan. But I think it's far more important to focus on your case right now.
You're hardly nice to anyone.
Thank you. So were you.
Healthy as can be.
Your pardon, M'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.
Jesus, Jeff.
Yeah.
Are you going to leave, too?
You're here.
I AM CALM.
You don't tell me, I know my rights, just come right in, you can't --
What does it look like?
I don't have to answer your questions.
I need to get out there and get those weeds out.
You hand that over to the police.
It's a piece of evidence that's worth a great deal more than that.
You took that money from Julia's hand.
Then what are you hiding?
I didn't.
That's what you were saying. I heard what you were saying.
What makes you ask?
You don't like Eve, do you?
How are the pigeons?
Then you did say it.
She works hard.
You're leaving?
Start off in Madrid. Ever been there?
We're partners.
I'd feel a whole lot better if you took some more money.
Do you blame yourself for helping me?
Spain.
What's her name?
What ?
Shut up ! It's me.
I know. They're rich drug addicts and celebrities. When I saw James Taylor there, and --
You don't have a choice. No one else is going to tell you what's going on.
Then it's not your problem.
Jesus.
What're you going to do?
You can't just... kill him.
My God.
Why do you ask that?
You should... mind it.
You don't have to be sorry. There's no one to blame. Jean, you're a real artist. I thought I was one. You made me realize I wasn't.
If anyone ever spoke to me, the way I heard... The way she spoke to you, I don't think I could ever laugh again.
Well he was a boy, he was my friend...he was my best friend. When we were kids we were gonna...move out here and move to the Brady Bunch.
Well, it doesn't open cans or anything but it...it's sort of a reminder of a friend of mine.
This isn't just a mood ring.
Oh, no wait, I like that you bought me here.
But what about me?
Well, I hope he's not watching me all the time.
Yes, that Mulwray, Mr. Gittes. And since you agree with me we've never met, you must also agree that I haven't hired you to do anything. Certainly not spy on my husband. I see you like publicity, Mr. Gittes. Well, you're going to get it.
Not that kind... You men and your egos.
I don't know.
Stolen phone cards and two-ways is what you sayin'.
Just a cough. Sugar and a spoonful of Jack'll do it.
She's gone.
But, Bruce, don't keep it in your wallet!... Well, you see -- -- there's an old newspaper superstition that the first big check you get you -- you put in the lining of your hat. That brings you good luck for ten years.
Two minutes, Alvy.
In the middle? We'll only miss the titles. They're in Swedish.
Two hours? No, u-uh, I'm going in. I'm going in.
Look, while we're talking we could be inside, you know that?
What is it?
Did you hear what Gibarian said? I'm not a human being. I'm an instrument. I came from your memory and your imagination and I will torture you no matter what. Even if I remain passive. That's when I drank the... I was going mad. It felt like there was no body underneath my skin. There was something else. An illusion. But I could feel my heart beating, and I remembered you tested my blood. Is it like yours?
...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
Shit! The house is on fire!
Oh you!
Hope is a four-letter word.
Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was--
Murray.
My mother died in this canyon.
They do something to me. It's hard to think straight.
Take it easy, Raimondo. Why are you getting so impatient?
Well... I proposed them to play roulette... Like we played... ...And I lost.
I want to stop taking those pills.
But then I would be dead now.
How can you ask me that?
I know what I know.
Okay, one drink.
Thank you so much. You have to let me pay you something --
No. Mr. Bianchinni asked me to do it. I did it.
I'm sorry, look, forget it. I shouldn't have called...
I told Bianchinni I would take a look. Is it that sink?
Do you have a pot or a bucket?
Sure.
Well -- I was going, but Mollie fainted away and I thought I ought to do what I could.
There's only two of us. Maybe someone came in our house -- took the bumble bee pendant out of my closet, and then laid it nicely in your drawer? Is that what happened?
That girl's making an awful spectacle of herself.
I just thought you'd like to know --
Thea is an orphan.
You think now that Jake's dead, there's all that money there and I don't need you anymore, and I might just sneak up behind you sometime and...pop!
Is it real?
He's coming.
Absolutely.
That's very funny.
Did you see that?
I don't know. Something.
I don't know what you're talking about. What's happened?
He wants to know who you are. Your name. I told him we don't need to know anything about you.
You don't believe me anymore?
Come on, let's go! Let's get out of here!
Hm-mm... Hm-mm...
But... where is Dunois... where are the men the king promised me?
Sure.
What?
At least you and Kendall agree on that.
And I saw you practicing this...
I know. He hates to have to wear uniforms.
Alvy, I can't say that that's true at this point in my life. I really just can't say that that's true. I mean, you know how wonderful you are. I mean, you know... you're the reason that I got outta my room and that I was able to sing, and-and- and, you know, get more in touch with my feelings and all that crap. Anyway, look, I don't wanna- Listen, listen, listen, uh h'h, so whatta you up to anyway, huh?
I feel pretty.
Sherry. Very old, very dry.
I love you, Will, beyond poetry.
Yeah a real shame.
Part of it. We were watching "ER" until someone called.
Which show was that?
Mother... go away!
You gonna get a lot more a'that, you keep me locked up like this!
You have sixty seconds... here's the question... Which one of you is Frances?
Ronny!
You think that's a good idea?
No.
Good night?
What's the matter? Did I do something wrong?
Not so rough, honey.
No. Nothing is nothing. I want Wally to come home. I'm afraid to see him, too.
Good night, Daddy.
Daddy, please ...
Nothing.
So I'll have to order in?
For what?
Early, just think...
THERE'S NO ONE IN THERE. STAY OUT OF MY MOTHERFUCKIN BEDROOM.
I don't have to do a god damn thing.
I didn't hear anything.
Now that's over, let's get to know each other.
Not very -- but I'm going to be there anyway.
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm full up. You'll have to take the next elevator.
I CAN'T!
No you didn't. You took the car.
You'd better get to bed yourself.
You went out last night, didn't you, Joe?
I just happen to know it. I had a nightmare and I screamed for you. You weren't here. Where were you?
We will? The Symphony? Okay. I'll take you to the Russian Tea Room for pelmeni.
Walter, I'd love to --
Get in bed. Y'ever hear of the sixty hour work week? You're turning into a yuppie Frankenstein, you love money so much.
Happy New Year.
Why are you always leaving me, Harry?
No!
Litterbug.
Try to.
So what's the plan, Thelma? You just gonna stay drunk?
"Love your enemies"...
I want you inside me right now.
At least I have a point of view, you know?
Book?
Yes, you asshole.
Fine...except when Mom was airing Gage's diaper rash, he walked away and got into Grampa's study and pooped in Grampa's favorite chair.
I'm home!
You know, like weird 1960's Indian rock n' roll music.
Oh, yeah, well look where you came when you were down and out.
So what'd the other guy look like?
Well, now, maybe you won't have to.
Oh you do, do you? It is my dearest hope, Doctor, that he remain entombed forever, and that when at last he perishes in the dank bowels of your institution, he be left as carrion for the rodents and the worms.
But you look like you been in a train wreck, how'd he just drive away?
Poor creature...
Do you have any other old records besides these?
When a guy hurts you, then comes back bleeding on his hands and knees, who knows, he might just be irrestible.
R-r-r-really? You r-r-really w- wwant...?
Have you ever gone with anyone who--
I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids. Nobody acts sincere.
If you knew me you wouldn't say that.
Why?
Sidney, I know you by now. Don't do a dance with me...
I wish I could help in some way, Sidney.
I hate to see you like this --
It's nothing. Just the long trip. I'm a little jet-lagged.
No, I'll be fine. Can you just hand me a glass of water?
No rain.
Performance number one thousand of this one - if I play it that long - will take place in a well-padded booby hatch...
I must say you can certainly tell Mr. Sampson's been gone a month.
He's pretty... remarkable.
And the food sucks, I know.
You're welcome.
I trust you.
Ok.
Thanks very much. That was very nice of you.
I'm just a bit of a wreck. "I sleep in your hat" makes me cry. Me.
Remember? "And you take on the dreams of the ones who have slept there And I'm lost in the window I hide on the stairway I hang in the curtain I sleep in your hat..." Oh, shit. I'm so stupid. Sorry.
The song's 9th and Hennepin. I spent most of the train ride trying to remember. "Till you're full of rag water and bitters and blue ruin And you spill out Over the side to anyone who'll listen." Remember?
Me too. It is Rain Dogs, by the way.
Oh, geez, I'm full of shit. I already told you that. Anyway. See Ya.
What do you mean? You're Rita.
I'm not. I don't know what my name is. I don't know who I am!!
What's wrong?
I don't know who I am.
What is it Rita?
I'm...I'm... oh no... I thought when I woke up... I thought sleep would do it ...
Good night, Duff.
Why?
Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
Oh. Well, for Blackie then.
Hey.
Maybe it's legit.
Well, take my word for it, and don't try it. It's useless! If it were some other woman, I could handle her, but after all, you can't scratch a bank's eyes out now, can you?
What are you going to do now, Tom?
Hardly.
Oh, well. I guess the only other thing for me to do is to go out and buy myself a few sticks of dynamite. When he comes out, you tell him I'll be back. He hasn't gotten rid of me!
All right.
Board meeting. Oh, that means hours, I suppose.
I'm afraid so.
Hi.
How have you dumped girls in the past?
I knew this guy last summer in the Hamptons. He and his girlfriend at the time were madly in love with each other. But she had this huge weight problem. His friends taunted him mercilessly about it. You know, "How do you breathe when she sits on your face?" "It's embarrassing for you to be seen with her." Finally he couldn't take it anymore and decided to dump her. She flipped and he went on the defensive. I distinctly remember him saying the same thing over and over again. "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." "I'm completely fucked up." Poor fatty never had a chance.
...can we have a white one...?
Come and get me, soldier --
No answer... Maybe we should just drive there tomorrow. Can I have that one?
People. They could be looking.
I'm sorry -- I can't --
I can't do this --
Please, Palmer -- if you care for me at all, don't push this now --
Please --
How much closer would you say you were?
You turn it on, you open it and you stand in front of it for a very long time.
Thank you.
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
A little of this, a little of that. Mostly I tell fortunes.
I guess it must.
It just is.
I would say so, yes.
Oh, no - it's too delicious! You're making it up!
Yes -- yes, they have. It was a real shock at first, especially since my daddy's a preacher, but Delbert and I have been blessed by their being here.
Yes, it is --
What?
Look it... I put the Goddamn dress on, didn't I? I think I'm handlin' myself with some... fuckin' restraint here... how you got me locked up like a dog on a...
I can handle that.
You know, Buddy, sometimes you make me sick.
That is going to be rather difficult when all the evidence is against us.
I tried, Arnie. And, I will continue to try.
Robin.
Yeah, like the bird.
What does that mean?
But now it's free, right?
I'm twelve.
Now what?
Why? Is this about the book?
Where are we going?
No.
Take me home, Diz.
You were not dead before. When I thought you dead, I did not care about all the plays that will never come, only that I would never see your face. I saw our end, and it will come.
You take the microwave?
You don't even know me.
You're a good man, Hardy.
Someone called me. When they couldn't get you they told me you were as good as broke. I didn't believe then, so I made some calls.
Do you know what to do?
What a man!
Oh, knock it off! 89.
No no. Don't cry at the beginning of the date.
He's pissing his pants. Is that real enough for you? Call 911!
Maybe you should call her.
It'll do just fine. Bye-bye, see you later.
But see, he stopped before I got that feeling, that's why it seems weird to me. I mean, I'm sure he wishes I would initiate things once in awhile, and I would except it never occurs to me, I'm always thinking about something else and then the few times that I have felt like starting something I was by myself.
Don't trouble yourself about it, Homer--this ain't your business.
About a week ago. I don't know what brought it on, I just started feeling like I didn't want him to touch me.
Oh, yeah. But see, I've never really been into sex that much, I mean, I like it and everything, it just does't freak me out, I wouldn't miss it, you know? But anyway, lately we haven't been doing anything at all. Like I said, it's not that I miss it, but I'm curious the way things kind of slacked off all of a sudden.
I guess you must like watchin' me be sick...
Fine, I guess. Except right now I'm going through this where I don't want him to touch me.
If you think I'm a house nigga then that's your prerogative. You got your ways to affect change, I have mine. And I would appreciate it very much if you took ya field nigga ass out of my house.
Simone, I recognize the shirt you're wearing. I gave it to Viktor on his birthday.
Hey! -
Charley, my husband, and I are ...divorced and Kim, that's our daughter is about Billy's age and the children play together a lot. So, I guess we see each three or four times a week.
I'm splendid, too.
The problem is the by-product created by the process.
The late Mister Futterman?
To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
Always, my dear one, never any further. Love is a child to be pacified with trifles. A full diet can only kill it.
Be so good as to tell me with whom you think you are?
And if she does not choose to show you some kindness?
You will do as you please. It seems to me that such a matter can hardly be discussed until after people know each other. Do you not agree?
I wouldn't want you as a friend.
Funny how he's the architect and you're just a loud mouth cop.
Great... ...Wanda!
Well, I guess I better look for another one, then. Thanks, anyway.
I'm waiting for the phone.
Buy ya a beer?
I know, me too. What should we do About it?
I think we're ready now, thank you. And how was Norfolk? Did you get on with my mother?
Did she talk about me?
What are you doing?
I want you to let me go.
Didn't know I needed a reason to come home.
I'm glad we talked.
Yes.
They came out of my body!
He wouldn't ask you to handle it if he were guilty.
Yes.
Oh, hello. Come on in.
The fat man down there, on the bench.
Who'll I aim at?
I saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. I know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.
You fucking...
You not ugly.
Promise you won't forget me.
Promise me one thing.
Oh Matt, you must be mistaken.
What's the matter, Matt? Gee, I thought you'd be thrilled to death.
Well . . . ?
Marty...
What happened? What did he say? Did you get the job?
West?
Yeah.
Sir, I want you to know that I had nothing to do with any of this. Not this article, not --
Permission to leave, sir?
Think I overplayed it?
You swore. You owe me a quarter. Did you remember my egg carton? I told you I needed my egg carton for seed planting today.
Absolutely Duncan I'm on top of everything.
I'm gonna beep daddy at work.
When? We need money now. Either he pays now, or you don't do it.
I don't trust this man. And I didn't like what he did with your opera. It was common.
You're not going to do this?
Half the house! You'll never see a penny. I want it here, in my hand.
comes in with a breakfast tray: bacon and eggs, tea and toast.
I'm not hungry.
You've got to eat, Yvonne. You hardly touched our dinner. I'm not having you falling ill.
starts to cut up a slice of bacon and offers it to Pauline.
You may have forgotten that you were once a very sick little girl, but I haven't!
Do you think Juliet could stay here while her parents are away?
Annie made them.
No. No. It's not like that. I've got a husband, you know.
Killed? I don't know anything about it.
What about?
She's nothing to do with me.
I must go. I'm in a hurry.
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this I'll help it presently!
George?
You've never even been around one.
Yeah.
But in the same house, you know, one house.
Maybe you don't even like children.
Please. Let them stay 'til morning. The militia will not come here, they know you are a Hutu with influence.
I'm thirty.
They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
...Hannah read it, she got really angry, and... you know, then I felt badly, so I--
Oh, no! It wasn't anything bad. But she just... you know. I don't know.
But you have to remember while you're reading and you're cursing my name, you know, that this is my first script. Well, it's not my first script.
Actually, my first script was about Hannah and her husband, but, uh...
Why am I here, Mr. Hadden?
What is?
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and afternoon.
Agnes it had nothing to do with the hand of God. He did a terrible thing to you, do you understand?
Stay away from me...
Agnes... Agnes...
It's bleeding... I'm bleeding... my God it won't stop, I can't get it to stop. Let go of me, I wish you were dead.
S.R. Hadden... You compromised our security codes.
Oh. Okay. That's okay.
I was wondering -- could you tell me who I'd talk to about maybe getting an advance on my paycheck? Just -- for the weekend.
-- I don't know --
And then I can go home?
Please please please. I'll do anything. Just don't call my mom.
What are you doing?
Just a kiss, right?
But -
I do. You never stood up for yourself. Ever. If I was ashamed, it was because of that.
I don't remember that.
What's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.
And yet that's always how I seem to end up, isn't it? If you really do love me, Palmer, you'll leave. Now. Please.
I'd sooner die than use magic!
We have a daughter together. I just don't want to see Viktor get hurt.
Don't do that!
I can't stand to see you like that. I know you can't help it.
Do you want me to carry your pack for you?
You sure you can manage?
Did you like it; me watching you?
Stop it ... damn you!
Yes. We will light the candles.
My daddy lets me sit on his lap.
Tuesdays and Thursdays. But after Play Practice, I'm yours.
May I pet the deer?
It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
I brought you a present. Merry Christmas.
A Christmas present. It's been so long since I've had a Christmas present.
Some people I know, they're planning to rob The Golden Lion.
I know that. But you can now.
I owe a lot of money.
I'm in trouble.
Can't I have anything to myself, dammit?!
I don't know where she is!
It's none of your business!
Fuck you.
No dogs, huh? Okay.
When do you need her by?
Well, I could probably get you laid in two weeks, but to locate a non-mutant wife from Pasadena...that could take some time.
Why'd call me a killer?
Let's have lunch!
Stars.
What time?
You know me better than that.
Why not?
Plenty of time for a nice long nap - we rehearsed most of last night...
I don't fuckin' cook.
Well, don't worry. I saw Miss Jacqueline only a week ago. I saw her at a little restaurant the boy friend took me to -- an Italian place down in the Village -	"The Dante."
"The Dante?"
Nothing's happened to her. It's just that I can't understand her not getting in touch with you.
I can't understand it at all.
I'm worry to bother you. I want to ask you about my sister.
It's on Peary Street. Just ask the people who run it. They'll remember her. People who see Miss Jacqueline never forget her.
I'll try there.
I thought you might know her. She was seen here about a week ago. Her name is Jacqueline Gibson.
Too many good players down here. I'm with one right now.
This has nothing to do with you. You helped me out, and I'm grateful.
Don't make me... me... me... get up!
Just inner chambers...
No...
Yes, crazy about you! Kiss me, Mr. Hillyer!
That's not true...You gotta ease up... Conversations have a life of their own. You gotta just go with it...We're having a lovely conversation.
I...
I don't feel like I make any impression on people... At office parties I spend my time re-arranging the hors d'oeuvres as people eat them, so the platters will always look full. I don't start conversations because I have no idea how to end them...I think I'm just meant to live in the background of things.
Who's that?
Bigger and better.
So, he knows where you are. That means he's sending some guys over here probably right now.
Here.
He called you right here.
Lester - he called you here.
When was that?
My kids want me to teach them.
I don't like... uh... Polish love stories... ... I like musicals.
Got any Ethel Merman?
I think they're made for each other. And it scares me.
I don't like horror movies!
Peter, please...
Oh they'd never let me do what I want.
Yeah?
You do not want me to do your cover.
Fiddlesticks!
Willa Harper there is certain plain facts of life that adds up just like two plus two makes four and one of them is this: No woman is good enough to raise growin' youngsters alone! The Lord meant that job for two!
Why?
I don't want to hurt you.
That's my line!
No. I mean work work.
There's the Prescots...
Listen, I've gotta run. I just thought I'd stop by and see if you want to take the boat out, say Thursday morning?
Maybe there's something that's not in the report that should be.
Thanks.
I don't know.
Larry...
Leon hung himself...
My brother hung himself.
Leon hung himself.
We're actually, finally doing this?
No, it's fine. Thanks for making the call, I guess.
Like what? Be a rock star?
I don't have it on me. Anyway, it means a lot. Have you read the reviews? They're love letters. Listen to this one. "Simone has the voice of a young Jane Fonda, the body of Sophia Loren, the grace of, well, Grace Kelley, and the face of Audrey Hepburn combined with an angel".
Viktor... I want to thank you for convincing Simone to sign with the studio.
Why isn't she with you?
Where is she?
Yeah.
Bottega.
Not quite. He did defense. I'm a prosecutor...
Like what?
You psychic?
For your information, Frank cares what was in those ponds 'cause he used to spend half his day wading around them. That was his job.
I guess it was a little too inconvenient. So for fourteen years, this stuff flowed into the groundwater, free as you please.
It didn't help, but no. The real problem's on the bottom.
See, according to this, they were supposed to line the ponds so this shit couldn't seep into the ground. But guess what --
They covered 'em over. And not too carefully either, cause you dig one inch under the surface, and the dirt is green as a fucking shamrock.
No --
I just got goosebumps.
What's that?
How do you know?
Is there a part for me?
Where?
Why not?
What I can appreciate is insolence, Mr Lombard!
Maybe I am a little. James, I've got to leave for the office. Are you going to be all right?
It's Grace.
The caterer had to back for hors d'oeuvres- Voila.
No, Mother! It's War! War!
The point is, they want a man inside.
Don't forget your towel.
The traffic takes some getting used to.
Look, Ted, all I--
Here! Here... ten, thirty, fifty bucks. How much have you got, Chucky? Give Mister LaPlante your money.
If you're not in the car in ten seconds, I'll have the cops pick you up.
For God's sake, tell him I'm on my way. Let's go, Chucky. A police escort is gonna pick us up en route. You too, LaPlante.
No.
Derek!
You'll see for yourself.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
You can't sell this to your friends.
Is this a bad time.
I've never even met you.
I know. And I'm sorry. I've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.
I thought you would be on your way to Vegas by now. Is there something you wanted?
I saw you on television yesterday. You were brilliant.
You said that malignant narcissism was not evil.
Peter Kelson?
I'm trying. I'll see you tomorrow.
What if it's beyond science? What it it's God?
I told you, I've already lived my life. I don't know how or why I'm here, but you have to help me get back. I want to get back to my real life!
Roy... What if I told you I wasn't really your mother? That we weren't related?
Maybe. For three years I've sung in rats' nests, while Jerry pounded his feet off and his brains out -- trying to get me a real chance. We're due for a little luck!
Don't
You oughta lay off him -- he is the p-p-president, after all.
A future. The only future I've got.
I had to sleep fast so I took two allergy pills to help me...I'm sorry...Hey, you called me.
Boy, Rimgale's as slow as a snail, isn't he?
Yeah, but it doesn't take Albert Einstein just to figure out if these guys were killed by accidents or not.
Why, you need me for the story?
Got anything to drink in there?
Are you okay ?
Maybe I don't want you to.
But where do you come from?
You really are stupid, you know that.
You think so?
I got there early. I've had my eye on this suit -- Wait, let's start over. I got there early. The idea was to try on the suit, see if I liked it. If I did, get them to wrap it up, and change back into my uniform. That's what Sheronda's expecting me to wear. Go meet Sheronda, give her the bag with fifty thousand, and go home.
No.
Burnett? They want 22 of the value on loads they run into South Florida. It's the Juarez cartel model. They guarantee the loads. The upside is our risk goes to zero. That frees-up capital.
They're serious. They're cautious. They'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.
A good deal, like this with us, for Burnett will be good only temporarily. He'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever. Life is dust, make it while you can. He's ambitious.
Here comes an avalanche of bullshit.
Sixty seconds, then I'm out of here.
I've done you enough favors.
"My type"? What is this bullshit? How would you know what "my type" is?
I have a pretty good idea.
I think you're afraid to put the two of us in the same room together. I think you're afraid he'll be undeniably drawn to me.
Oh, for God's sake. Really, Cynthia, really, I don't think he's your type.
Ann, you always underestimate me.
Well, I wonder why.
I say it because it's descriptive.
Well, he doesn't strike me as the kind of person that would go in for that sort of thing, anyway.
You sure you feel up to it, Nathan?
Ann, you don't have a clue. Look, I don't even know why we're discussing this, I'll just call him myself.
He doesn't have a phone.
Yes. As I said, I was very grateful.
Well, how much would you like?
I have?
Mr. Gittes... Don't tell me how I feel.
I'm sorry. I'm just working so hard --
Good. You're just what I need right now.
No, I really do. I think he's gonna kill me.
Yeah, uh-huh... Okay.
So, I'm gonna call you back in an hour... at this number, and you're gonna be there, right?
Bye.
Just knock it off! Would you two knock it off? Get in the car.
So... even you don't believe in me anymore...
Yes.
My head is throbbing.
I have a headache.
Oswald and ghosts.
Where are you going?
Who was that?
Hello ... No. He's not here. I haven't seen him all night ... I don't know when ... What? Tell him what? Vietnam? ... What experiments?
It might be for me.
Why are you doing this to me? You can't just go away like that.
I want to know. You tell me!
Here. I'll do it.
But I'd arranged to go home with you myself.
Bullshit. You're trying to feel less guilty about firing someone with three kids to feed. Fuck if I'll help you do that.
I live here, remember?
What?
I'm heading out of town.
A place you've never been.
What are you taking?
I don't know. Something. Anything.
Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... Like fer shurr!
I remember Harry always trying to help someone. He got Lulla's daughter out of trouble. He was always running to the store for someone who couldn't leave the house.
As long as he keeps his throat clear, he is able to get some rest.
It's really hard to reach you... Did you get the carpet samples? I like the burgundy.
Mister LaPlante... Bernie... I... just for a few moments... I want to be a human being, not a reporter. I'm somebody who was going to die in a burning plane and I looked up, and some man came out of the smoke, his face smeared with mud, and soot and... and he... saved my... life. Off the record. Was it you? Why would you deny it if it was? Because you took my purse? Why?
Then lets go back while we still can.
C'mon help me in. I'll open the front door.
You fool, you fool.
Get out of here.
Wallace himself. If you wish to pretend a ghost rallies new volunteers in every Scottish town, I leave you to your hauntings. If you wish to take him, I know a way.
Good day to you, M'Lords.
With eleven hundred he could come home, and that's the last thing I want.
And I won't take a penny over ninety.
Fine.
Sixty.
Seventy-five.
Shut up, Hippy. Bud, how you doing?
Sure. Ten cents.
Well, he's young and he's healthy.
Sixteen next month.
What do you think -- I should be carrying a torch for you?
...no...no...no...
Jody, no...
What?
Does that ever happen?
Know what I think?
Yes -- cocaine.
No.
I was at the house one morning -- I thought Miss Lawson was upstairs with Mr. Marsh. When I went into the guest bathroom she was standing in front of the mirror pouring this white powder out of a vial.
What?
Who?
Look at me -- I'm not even listening to a word you're saying.
Yeah?
I guess I'm upset because I can't really justify being upset, I mean, it's his house, really, he pays the mortgage.
Boy, do I know how you feel. First time I heard that number, I said you got to be kidding me. Forty God damn percent?
Well, I'll give you a hint. By tomorrow they'll be calling me Mrs. Bruce Baldwin.
No. I don't know. I haven't told him about the garbage thing because I'm pissed off at him right now. He's letting some old college buddy stay at our house for a couple of days, and he didn't even ask me about it. I mean, I would've said yes, I just wish he would've asked.
The quicker the better. Well -- I finally got out what I came in to tell you. So long, Walter, and better luck next time.
Well, I can, and I love it! He forgets the office when he's with me. He doesn't treat me like an errand-boy -- he treats me like a woman.
I don't know about water buffaloes, but I know about him. He's kind and sweet and considerate. He wants a home -- and children.
Thanks...
Mr. Malkovich?
You don't know me, but I'm a great admirer of yours.
I... I think I am...
Ben, maybe no talking right now? If you start talking, you're going to--
No, I didn't mean to sound negative. It was -- But Ben. What is going to happen with us? Have you --
What's the matter?
Before you pop too many buttons, don't forget to make out that check for a thousand.
Just take a look at it.
Oh my God, that was good. Where'd you learn all those new tricks?
Yeah, if you call multiple orgasms weird.
You're way more philosophical than I could ever be.
Oh, yes, Mr. Preysing?
Nothing.
I don't have to listen to you! You're not my mother.
No. I swear it.
No. Don't be an ass.
You can be John Malkovich.
And are they going to get it?
You're detestable.
Annabelle let's get something clear.
He never took his eyes off his mother, even as he moved to sit beside Nicole. He looked frightened.
No.
I don't know... There's no return address on the envelope... In fact, there's no address on it.
A videotape.
Wake me up when you get home.
Our next D.A. -- I hear Bruce Wayne is throwing a fundraiser. Did you get your invitation yet?
I like to laugh, Fred.
I thought I'd stay home and read.
Are you sure they're your friends?
Well, it's over.
I thought you might want some hot coffee.
Mr. Penfield. I am sorry to have kept you.
Why not?
Have you had any relationship since?
Sure you do.
And I don't want to invade your privacy --
I have no doubt that you're a good dad. You can tell a lot from a person's voice. But something must be missing if Jonah feels that you're still under a cloud.
What I meant and perhaps I didn't say it well was you have a great mom. You don't need another one. But when you're at this house --
Hi, Rosalind, this is Erin. Brockovich. From the file room? I was wondering if you could tell Mr. Masry that I'm following up on that real estate thing out of the office.
No!
That's now what I meant...
No...!
Yes, but...
I know, but that's not the way things happened...
Yeah, I read about that. Terrible business, suicide.
Me? Look at you! What're you doing in Hollywood?
Not bad. But come on, Harry; what's the real reason?
The TV didn't work.
And what are you? A cop?
How bizarre!
My name is Megan Inverso. We went to college together.
Guess who I did it with last night...
We are?
I mean, it's not a problem or anything, but -- I'm just a little unclear on what those things are. I thought maybe you'd know.
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
No. I saw it on his face.
No -- leave him be. It's better for everyone.
What did you do?
I'm twenty-nine years old. How old are you?
Benjamin Franklin High School.
That's really something.
Oh, good...
Stupid.
Yesterday.
Instantaneous.
So. Five years ago your hand got cut off and your woman left you for another man. No woman since then?
Why what?
Okay, Ann, okay. How about this: you buy her something nice, and I'll pay for half. All right?
I just thought it might --
I don't know, I'll get her a card or something.
Are you getting Mom something for her birthday?
He thinks people like to get whacked by branches.
Don't you think she deserves a little more than a card? I mean, the woman gave birth to you. It's her fiftieth birthday --
I know what you've been doing.
You've been giving him a flying lesson!
Norman, this isn't about you. This is something that's happening to me. It's not to get even...and it's not some warped bid for attention. Some strange things are happening in our house, whether you believe in them or not...
Want to sit down? Did you need somethin'?
The accident...?
She s pretty... See you, huh?
So the guy's not a sicko.
Okay, so he's a freak who thinks he's sane pretending to be a freak. The point is, he was a hitter. Somebody wanted to shut her up. But why not just put a little lead in her ear?
Now you're really getting paranoid.
Sure.
If... you have one.
Actually, I think you'll have to run out, but yes, that's what you have to do.
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.
What? Oh, yes. I mean, thank you. Please, sit down.
But I'm always afraid I'll say something stupid.
I could stand something regular.
Well, think. Because there's footprints here that aren't mine.
How about I just press the button?
I do know. Be two places at once... learn to hit a baseball or turn a cartwheel... eat breakfast with chopsticks...
You're in a beehive, pal, didn't you know? We're all busy little bees, full of stings, making honey day and night- - aren't we, honey?
Arthur!!
Oh really? I thought it was pretty good.
Two or three months, that's all. -- I seduced him.
Margo, really...
Do you think people in the New Town care what happens over here? This will always be the ghetto.
And you believe everything the authorities tell you.
About us going someplace warm... Someplace Grace'll have to wear shorts or bathing suits or summer dresses...
I have nothing to reproach myself for. All I know is that I've changed. With all my strength, which is not much, I will follow the road that the Lord has shown me. One can also serve outside a convent.
Forgive me if I have offended you.
I'M NOT BOFFING MATTHEW !
You're just foolin'! My name's Pearl.
Miz Jenny! Miz Jenny!
Did that help? Did you learn anything?
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be. I thought maybe I wanted to be a writer... but I hate what I write, and I tried taking pictures, but John's so good at that, and mine are so mediocre... and every girl goes through a photography phase, like horses, you know dumb pictures of your feet...
Yeah? But look at you.
And marriage, does that get easier?
But, I'm mean.
And you pose as a playwright. A situation pregnant with possibilities - and all you can think of is everybody to go to sleep...
Thank you.
Is it yes?
Do you?
Well, life's not fair. We know that.
The government bonds. The ones you took from the office safe.
The date's not set yet. I'll call you. One last thing: the man you're going to catch cheating, he may get violent. But you know how to deal with cheats.
I can't...and I won't.
You're really twisted, Gordon. You're incapable of giving to anybody because deep down inside you there's a poverty that every last dollar in the world won't fill.
Don't worry. You won't see him again. What happened? Did you change your mind about going?
Francesca.
Looking for something in particular? There's not much of a selection.
Sure.
Oh, that's nice.
Keep it between us girls?
You too, Diane.
Promise.
Good luck to you, Annie.
It's just one night. If I get uncomfortable, I'll go over to Hanks.
Dreaming.
I already know the way... and it's not like I have a job I have to rush home for. Between you and me, I could use the time alone.
I did. He said he had work to do until late.
What's the matter?
Oh, my god!
Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.
Is that what her daddy tells her?
What are you afraid of?
I'm not afraid of anything.
I don't understand - ?
I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.
We're not that different, Corky.
How can you sit in that bed and say that?
Because it's the truth.
Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
No, Bud, no... not you.
No one.
That wasn't fair. It was a question. Penalty round!
No.
No one. I promise.
Be like a weight off your shoulders.
Was it you? In the plane? Who saved my life?
Sugar or honey?
Does that mean we can't...
Mr. Stephens says that someone didn't put a right bolt in the bus...
What?! You're sorry? I don't believe that for a minute.
Make me forget it, baby.
You should stay.
I'm the same person I was before you knew, damn it! Oh God!
Apes don't shave, you son of a bitch!
I'm sorry. Please don't be mad at me for this.
It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry.
I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to...
Is she all right?
Thank you.
Don't push me, Duff.
What about that girl?
No. But a small one.
What time is it?
Don't you read Shakespeare?

Such a brief visit, but dear child, it has made my Christmas very merry.
And does he kill people?
No, not people -- just deer and game, but the people he catches can never be free again. They too must kill and kill, covering themselves with blood.
You didn't even open my present and I'm your daughter.
God, Stacy, it's not that sad. It's just David Soul and Ricardo Montalban.
What the hell are you doing?
Congratulations.
I made a fool of myself.
What about the notes?
It's too much machine for you.
I couldn't catch my breath. That's not a metaphor, that's...And I panicked. I never dreamed anyone would hear me back there... I tried to leave him. Went to my mother's in Boston. He brought my things up and pleaded with me to come home.
Um...sure.
I do love you. Let's get lost together.
You mean the ones you pity.
"Oh, Laura..."
Everything, but everything.
You know it and I know it.
I live right here.
So how do you - have you done any kind of inventory recently?
This one has been so hyped. We're tied for most wins with Northglen North. This year's winner will determine the winner of the century. The theme is everything. So whatever Southglen picks has to be totally unique--
My sister -- she'll want to know what happened to me.
Well, I haven't figured it out, exactly.
I'll tell her I spent the night with a friend.
Do you think she'll be all right?
How'd you make out on the twenty- seventh floor?
Good night.
Buff is funny. God.
No.
More romances for John?
Dinner will be served, shortly, dear.
Magic.
Well...
A dressing bag?
Oh, I know. She's so sweet, she's been so good to me...
Surprise.
Oh my gosh, here it is!
Look, it's my ass facin' the penitentiary. You send some hard- headed roc whore, and she fucks things up.
Who?
I'd never do that.
Henry wants me to try this Vietnamese place he's wild about. Want to come?
I know, ignoring me. What're you up to?
I've got to feed my cat. Besides, I want to get to bed early.
That's my girl.
I don't know. I won't be.
Will I be?
I think lipstick looks fake, no-ones lips are that color.
What?
Call him. Don't tell him anything. Tell him you're having a wonderful time and you'll be home tomorrow night.
Call him?
Burgel hated Eduard. And me. I'm sure he knew about us -- and I'm sure it drove him mad.
Well, hi!
Who painted that?
Have you ever tried any?
It must be my new shampoo.
Kinda gaudy.
Twenty-two.
Take something off.
I I brought this for you, Terry. It was Joey's. Yours is coming out at the elbows.
That's too bad.
Oh, that's too bad.
How do you do?
Yeah... oh, uh, and I'm gonna have a pastrami on white bread with, uh, mayonnaise and tomatoes and lettuce. Tsch, so, uh, your second wife left you and, uh, were you depressed about that?
We can digest our-
Oh.
I work in the DA's office. You go to those meetings, half the people there are informants.
I mean I'm a wheelchair girl now. It's hard to pretend I'm a beautiful rock star. Not like you used to tell me. Remember, Daddy? All the people that were going to discover me? Where are they now?
Nice.
How long will they watch us for?
Until Guy tells them to go. Once they watched me for like two hours. I found my car the next day in the T.J. Maxx parking lot.
Why do they listen to Guy?
: Because he's Guy Perkins. Listen, you want to walk to Na- Na's and get something to eat?
Yeah. Let's do that.
Yeah - isn't it amazing that those guys are our same age? I mean, they just seem so much younger, you know.
Oh I know.
I just did it for tonight. I don't normally dress like this.
She'll be here next weekend. Why don't you come too, James? I'll show you the marshes properly. If you're lucky you might even see the first of the geese arriving from Siberia.
She recovered.
She don't work here no more. I'm fillin' in for a couple days... till I can get a train outa here.
Don't be silly. I'll look out some more Suez material for you. You'll be very welcome.
Well, he doesn't have his Green Card. He Doesn't have his Greencard.
... you want Schumann saved by an Illegal Alien...?
We'll see you next week, and if--
And you believe that ?
It means "happiness."
LAZ, I said let...!
Don't you lay a CURSE ON ME!
Because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. And they'll b...
You got any money?
I said we wasn't gonna talk about him.
Save that hustle talk to them field ballers you sell crack to.
How did you find out all that?
It is. It's lovely.
We did at one point. When we thought we'd have more children. And we after tried. We tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.
To the manner born.
No, nothing. I'm just thinking about when Tom arrived in Mongi. And now look at you.
A hotel would've been fine. We'll have to tell Mr Greenleaf how far his dollar has stretched.
It's a start.
This is strange. Do you feel it?
Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working.
We've done this before, so many times. The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday.
Will this light do? Don't artists need good light?
A hundred dollars!
Roseman Bridge?
Are you supposed to be in Iowa?
I thought you said we were going to be friends.
I'm going to the powder room.
Good. Because I'm fed up.
That's what I'd like to know. She stole fifty dollars from my purse and took off.
What?
She left a note.
So Josh, will you give us a ride? Please? Pretty please? It's going to be super fun!
Where were you staying before the attempt on your life and why can t you go back there?
Committee.
That's how Congress--or any large body--is run. All work has to be done by committee.
Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on trays. We're executives. And we light into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is ready. You go over there and introduce it--
You get to your feet in the Senate and present it. Then you take the Bill and put it in a little box-- like a letter box--on the side of the rostrum. Just hold it between thumb and forefinger and drop it in. Clerks read it and refer it to the right committee--
Look--committees--small groups of Senators--have to sift a Bill down-- look into it--study it--and report to the whole Senate. You can't take a Bill no one knows anything about and discuss it among ninety-six men. Where would you get?
Can't complain. Got a house in Oyster Bay. Market treating you good? Still seeing that sexy French gal?
Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people.
Now, why in the hell would you assume that?
You wanna know, you gotta hire me back. I got a lot of bills to pay.
They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad.
I told Jimmy the cops took our cars and froze our bank accounts and he offered to get me some money. Be wants to know what's happening. You gotta meet him.
You did?
Suspicion of what?
I doubt it. Who's your friend?
Would I mind? Do I have a choice?
You could pick that scab on your arm.
The usual things. I'm a flight attendant with Cabo Air.
Well...
Actually, I think that I...
Yeah. What do you want. Life, right? Have you ever been to California?
I never do business in Cuba. And nobody goes to Cuba but me. And he is not my husband...
We got maybe three minutes till they break it down.
You kept Kendall alive to corroborate your story and he did it all they way up to the end. You even gave him his own motive in case we decided to burn him, too.
Miss, we are going to ask you to sign this little sheet of paper...
A job?
I'd like that.
Maybe the Romaris might have a room. They seem nice.
Yes.
After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
Are we goin' home, John?
I thought you were retiring?
What's that?
Lotte, this is so good...
Anne Lively. John was talking about her right before they took him.
It'll never happen, fuckface.
Oh, Matt . . .
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Do you?
Oh?
Ergo?
I'm always home by midnight and he's always asleep.
Me.
Hello, George.
And steal Darryl's fishin' stuff.
I know where Deauville is for C-C-Christ's sake.
You don't need it! That's the problem you always think you need everything--
That -- did you need that? How much did that cost?
There's a different between want and
Did you need it? Did you need any of it?
But why? Just so you can show it all off -- just so everyone can see what a b-b-big man you are?!
Oh ... Jesus!
I saved you from the lorry and you're not very special.
You mean you were meant to hijack my truck, make me crash it, and have every security man in town looking for me?
If you like. But don't be too modest, James. The citizen's duty is to remember, not necessarily to write books. You are highly qualified. You're a responsible journalist doing what sounds to me like a very demanding job. Every day you take decisions that depend on your sense of history. A genuine tyranny would have to get rid of people like you.
Sure ... Where would we go?
So what dead-end street did you and Shawnee hit?
The bee stings! I can't breathe!
Yes. Well. She's upstairs.
I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas.
Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now.
It looks a little like a swastika.
Why not?
May I go to the cinema?
Yes.
Why don't you take me with you?... I'm ready, now. You said I learn very quickly.
Mmm hmm.
Alex.
A hired player no longer. Fifty pounds, Will, for the poet of true love.
So we'll meet him, then?
Well ... if you don't remember anything, I mean what goes through your mind then if you don't remember anything?
Does this sound like a good course? Uh, "Modern American Poetry"? Uh, or, uh-let's see now... maybe I should, uh, take "Introduction to the Novel."
Then why are you always pushing me to take those college courses like I was dumb or something?
You don't think I'm smart enough to be serious about.
Yes, it is.
That little apartment is four hundred dollars a month, Alvy.
More.
I want some more.
Well, a very real expectation is the British will hang you! They'll burn Mount Vernon and they'll hang you! Our marriage is a business just as surely as...
My God, what?
But to go to war over trade, over money? Surely there's still time for a compromise.
War? No! I did not! When you said compromise was possible I believed it was probable. There's no middle ground at all? We're the King's children!
This seems a little sophisticated for them. These are not subtle guys.
I can not allow the fortune in slaves my first husband created and what our partnership has elevated, to be destroyed...
You went to my high-school?
Then how do you know about --
I'm sorry sir, we need your debit card before we can issue a credit --
Your life is not built on nothing. Ti amo.
What are you talking about?
I can't do anything to make you stay? These people annoy you, isn't that it?
But! I'm a married woman!
What do you mean?
Five times a day?
I don't know. One minute he's up in the air and makes love to me five times a day and tells me everything's going to be great and he's getting his own shop and then suddenly he disappears and he won't even talk to me. It's driving me crazy.
After four years? No I don't... and I don't know too many girls who do.
Well, you know what I mean.
Why? You act like you didn't know one day this would happen.
It also seems like a problem with the men's attitude, sir. So maybe you should be sniffing around their shower room instead.
Sir, someone mentioned you received the Navy Cross. May I ask what you got it for?
I see. So when a man tries to rescue another man, he's a hero. But when he tries to rescue a woman, he's gone soft.
Yours truly... And he even has to write his full name...Martin Pauley...not even just Martie!... I don't care if he never comes back!
No, nothing like that. Billy's wife, Lydia, died of cancer a few years ago. He took over raising the children by himself. It was obvious how much he missed Lydia.
Well, let's pray that's the only mistake you made. Have you said anything to Barnes about this?
Billy, that's too early.
Alright Agnes... it's alright. One, two three... It's alright... it's me, Doctor Livingston, it's alright, alright. Thankyou Agnes, thankyou. How do you feel?
He said you're the only one he ever saw who was better in the air than him.
...it's really not so bad Annabelle -- Red and Blue make purple.
Do you smell shit?
I tried Cheerios this morning. He didn't even get up. Maybe they took out the wrong teeth.
It will be okay if I sleep. I need to lie down and sleep.
If you have a concussion you shouldn't sleep.
No.
Oh...
I think I've been hurt.
She sure is. She's letting me stay here while she's working on a movie that's being made in Canada, but I guess you know that. I couldn't afford a place like this in a million years. Unless of course I'm discovered and become a movie star. Of course, I'd rather be known as a great actress than a movie star, but sometimes people end up being both and that is, I guess you'd say, sort of why I came here. I'm sorry, I'm just so excited to be here..I mean I just came here from Iowa and now I'm in this dream place. You can imagine how I feel.
Richard, Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all to you --
Not that it's any of your business but yes.
I'd love to, but unfortunately I'm expecting some company.
Well done.
Annette?
Mind if I ask what you're doing in my room?
Maybe it doesn't matter if he's a good dancer cause it's a slow song, if that's what he's afraid of.
The final countdown.
I'm sorry.
Admit what, I'm an opium fiend? No, Wyatt, I just said I need it. I need something to keep me warm At night.
You know nothing. What you don't Know would fill a book. Jesus, I Feel like it's when you're around I need it most. You're never Yourself, you never relax. Never. Everything's so stiff and dead. You always have to keep a rein on Everything, ever yourself. Oh, You smile sometimes, I've even Seen you laugh. But there's no Light in your smile for me, Wyatt, nothing to keep me warm. And I get cold, Wyatt. I get so cold. What's between you and that Jew woman?
Raimondo... Do you enjoy fishing underwater?
Why have we stopped?
Have you ever heard the saying, "He hasn't got enough sense to come in out of the rain?"
Nothing, I guess... have you ever made it with a guy?
Guess who's got a date with Bruce Wayne?
Yeah, twice.
What happened?
He does it right in front of him.
It's getting better and better. Keep going.
Has Caesar ever seen him?
Gino doesn't know English, or at least he pretends he doesn't, so he doesn't talk much. He gets right to the point. Both times they talked for about five minutes, had one drink and then they left.
What did Gino drink?
Yes.
I think I'd better go home now please.
No.
Will you take me home now?
I think I'm gonna just get this for today. I'm in kind of a hurry. Would you mind ringing this up while I change out of it?
This looks pretty good on me.
Are you getting that black suit?
Hi, Melanie.
Jackie?
Thanks.
It looks good on you.
Yeah, do you like it?
Well, sure, I guess. Pop says so too. I work pretty hard at school.
You have tranquilizers?
Oh, no.
Maybe I've just got the creeps.
No. No! Calvin, this is different! Believe me!
Uh, oh. Now it's time.
Uh-huh?
And I realized, he's taking a chance too.
I'd take him to the doctor.
What were You doing there? You never told me you were singing with an R and B group.
I'd forgotten how much music meant to you.
How's Pilgrim doing?
Liz is taking care of him. The doctor said the sooner you start therapy the better the chances are you can --
I can't even get out of bed yet! You're already putting me in therapy!!
Dad! I can do it, OK?!
A thank-you note for what you did for me.
What for?
I don't want it. But why don't you stay and finish your drink.
I don't know...
I'd kill it.
How?
No, there's no tomorrow. Not with you. You own all the tomorrows because you buy them today, and you buy cheap.
You bastard.
Listen, kid, I think you snapped your cap.
Of what? What were you so afraid of?
Why not, it's all true! The board is using this poor guy! They're depressing the stock so they can buy it cheap!
Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things.
Had any schooling?
I know they're gonna buy that stock --
Good.
In case you hadn't figured, it's Christmas Eve. You're never gonna get a cab here.
All right. You got somewhere you need to go, Mister?
Let me ask you that again. This time, look around and consider your options.
Why did you take me to the hotel, if you live here.
Stop being defensive. I want to help you. I wrote a song for you.
That's not fair! I was honest! Just because I wasn't sucking up like that bitch Catherine.
--followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass around--his little heart poundin' away--the sound of angels' wings in his ears.
...Hello?
Go get Tom an' Al. I dunno what to do. I got to feed the fambly. What'm I gonna do with these here?
For what?
Out to lunch with the girls.
Not exactly, but with your great voice, it'll be a huge hit. Honest.
Oh, God, what are we going to do? I'm supposed to --
Every time I think of it, I get a laugh, Diz.
I...I mean......I...it's none of my business.
The turkey in?
With who?
Yeah. I got it. No problem.
Professor Barnhardt.
I heard what you did. Thank you.
It's his heartbeat.
No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me.
Just not my type, I guess.
Well?
You ever think about going back?
What?
How was your trip?
Hi.
No, not really. I come from an "area". Bel Air.
No, not really. Middle-class.
Maybe upper-middle-class.
Here what comes?
Yeah. Yours is nicer.
I know it was bad, honey. I'm sorry...
Careful you don't spit from here; you could kill someone.
Hey, Ros. Nice view, huh?
N'about ten minutes. What was your movie about?
The president has been murdered.
There, that's better.
I should like to see my drawing.
I don't know now without my father.
I have done this, you know. Been inside.
Yes.
Oh, you need a shave. You mustn't go looking like that. There's a razor and shaving cream in the bathroom. Compliments of the house.
Somebody's come. Already.
Who?
Who?
Go away, I don't want you here.
Which one?
I don't know which one
Of what?
Of me. Oh... God! My God... Water... it's all water...
Why isn't anyone coming?
They can't hear me that's why. Oh God... I don't wanna...
...Which one...?
...well, it suits you...
...home. It's getting late. Yeah.
Can I give you a ride to your car...?
My man. 'Pimp.' I split 'cause he don't treat me for shit. Thinks he's so cool 'cause he's black. I once tried to take my clothes but he says, 'You can't take 'em 'cause they're my clothes -- I bought 'em.' Yeah, with my fucking money...
Don't get upset. I lied too. I don't make no five hundred dollars a week. Everything I make goes to Granville.
-- see, I thought you grew up here in the valley --
I'm at work, asshole. Where else?
The... chain helps.
Where'd you play?
Baseball?
I've been looking for him. Do you know where he is?
What's wrong with him?
How can you say that to me?
I need to confess again.
Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
Okay.
You're okay, though, huh?
He already did, but I want God to forgive me too.
Oh. Oh.
I want to know.
What sort of car?
It's not my boyfriend -- and it's not anything -- it's over. Really. It's not. He won't came back.
Yeah.
I don't have a boyfriend.
-- is not my boyfriend.
Hildy Johnson... Oh, hello, Bruce. Have you got it? Is it certified?
Well, anyhow, I won't be covering stuff like this any more.
Well, I'd love it if you'd read it, actually, 'cause I really would value your opinion.
I don't know why you boys are so good to me.
Nothing doing. I'm playing for keeps.
Oh that's great.
Did you pick it up from the street?
Your portable reed organ....the piano.
Are you learning how to play it?
Did you take it from the street in front of your work?
I know what I'm doing. Where have You been?
Who's fault is it then if it's not yours? You're the one in charge, Daddy.
Look. Those kids are still trick-or- treating. They're still out.
I don't care. They're out.
My son was in the hospital --
This is so noble.
Sure I'm sure. What is this?
Benjamin?
But the Emperor of China had 1000 of them! How can that be?
You did explain, Lenny.
We've certainly missed you.
Doesn't matter. I always finish second.
It was in a book at school. Concubine.
No place, fast. And you're not coming.
Come on, Laura. I'm your best friend.
Where are you going?
Where are the Cookies?
You mean Fred and Ginger?
Isn't tonight the night you are going to do it with Mike?
Laura, aren't you going to fix me a drink?
Yeah.
Dancing.
If I had a nickel for every cigarette your mom smoked, I'd be dead.
I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
Hi. You called me?
Bruce, you know I'm mad about you and stop talking like that. Walter!
We'll explain the whole thing to them.
Okay, Walter.
Bruce, I know, but I was in the biggest jam --
Because he was worried about me.
...and I don't think I'm some lonely, middle-aged woman cracking up.
How? How can you help me? With your flowers and your perfect life...
I'm just saying it'd be nice if you found time for your family. You should see the tramps coming after Quincy. If you don't talk to him...
You said you'd think about going back to get your degree.
Fine, then how many nights home is that?
You said you wanted to quit working for Ettore.
Yes.
Even though he knew about you?
Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
Excuse me. Excuse me!
That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them.
He was in love with you, right?
Geez, Mr Crane, I don't know. I hadn't really thought about a career or stuff.
Geez, Mr Crane.
Boy.
Oh, Mr Crane--
No, I'm going home.
Dinner time?? You're like a dog! You just go home to eat.
I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life.
I see.
I bet.
Who's Mr. Lindgren?
What line is he in.
What was that? I couldn't hear you.
Hay? Yeah? So teach me a lesson.
Oh, yuck! Oh, gross!
I want to go home.
Excuse me, gentlemen
Thank you.
I'm marrying your brother!
Yeah well, it's been a bad day.
You don't get along with anybody!
Take her.
You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
What?
What did I do?
Yeah.
No. I'm OK. Thanks.
Don't you get it? I don't want to leave. This is who I am.
I don't think that has anything to do with --
Oh, wow.
You know, I'm assigned to this school. I see sixteen new hotshots every eight weeks. Your attention is flattering, but not really productive. Why don't you keep your mind on flying.
Talk about what, Patrick? What is there to talk about?
Why? What's wrong?
I want a firm commitment.
Touchy, touchy. I'm sorry I brought the wedding up. Let's just avoid the issue, alright? Now, are we having coffee?
Of course, it's just for us to verify your credit card information. It's completely confidential and it appears on your credit card billing statement as D D Mattress Man.
Oh, yes... yes...
No one will know your name.
Juliet!
What did you do with it?
The ten dollars.
Yes.
She doesn't seem to like you very much.
At least Jimmy and Mickey want to help. I talk to Mickey every day. That's more than I can say for the rest.
I can see that. But forget it. Stick to tennis, or whatever you're good at. Miniature golf. Here, your number's 37.
Oh, Miles. You're drunk.
Fine. What's, uh, what's on your mind?
Miles, don't call me when you're drunk.
Where are you?
Ken.
Gimme a break. One shrimp and fries to go! Anything to drink?
Well, Sheronda, it was nice talking to you.
That's what you do to go through with the shit you start. You rationalize. I can do this, Max, I know I can. But I can't do it without you.
Then you don't see him for a few days?
You know what's in the bag you're taking?
The doctor can tell, but I decided not to know. I want it to be a big surprise.
I guess Ron hasn't called yet.
Thelma, that is not an option.
But I don't know... something's crossed over in me and I can't go back. I mean, I just couldn't live...
Louise?
Yes, Thelma?
You're not gonna give up on me, are ya?
What do you mean?
You're not gonna make some deal with that guy, are you? I mean, I just wanna know.
No, Thelma. I'm not gonna make any deals.
I can understand if you're thinkin' about it. I mean, in a way, you've got something to go back for. I mean Jimmy and everything.
Don't you think it meant anything to him. Even if I am fifteen?
New hat? Jill's up, I see.
How's she doing?
You two want to do anything tomorrow and need a third party, give me a call, okay? I'm off.
What, "Q-man", did I forget to kiss your ass like everybody else?
I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. Had them long as I can remember.
That night you wanted to talk about your Dad I had a curfew. What was I supposed to do?
What are you doing?
No, not at all.
I'm... I'm alright.
It wasn't a date. He's just a friend.
Wait, don't hang up.
Let's get things straight, Bud. I'm not going to take a cut. I worked hard and you can't decorate a room in New York for less than 100,000. Curtains alone...
You got it all charted out don't you, like a stock projection.
Do you think you're ready?
I'll let you know.
Since you're going to be my escort, you'll need a new tie.
Yes, Maude, it is. It is a very good play.
A magician makes magic. Any fool can use it.
Looks like you done it.
What're you doing here...?
He's no magician.
Did you give that acorn its power?
Anybody ask anything?
Don't you have it on?
This gonna take long?
Oh, come off it, man.
I musta been stoned.
Why should I want to get out of here? This is where I live.
You want to make it like this?
How young?
I told you I'm not easily shocked.
Twelve years in prison?
Don't you want to make it? Can't you make it?
You seem to know what you re talking about.
Give it to me!
Would you like to come in?
It's this big hole. You could almost see bone.
You're a caterer?
No.
Your mallard?
Gus, this --
Thank you.
Oh, Charlie.
I know what you're saying, and I don't wanna hear it. I am doing the best I can.
Another raise wouldn't hurt. And with all the time I'm gonna be spending on the road, I'll probably be needing my own cel phone, won't I?
Well, are you?
I asked you first.
Why?
Making it with my mother?
Sir Henry is not alone. They all wish it. The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank--
But who is left?
If you did, you never showed it.
Don't try to make me feel guilty. The whole time we were together, you went out of your way to prove you didn't need me. Now, suddenly, for one night, you need me again. I can't do it. I can't be more than your friend. Because I know what will happen. In a few weeks you'll be back on top, and you'll shut me out just as soon as you don't need me again.
Eight. That okay?
I'm the greatest star of them all.
Until the accident? No. Yes, there was.
You know, I made a reservation at Marco's for Peter's birthday dinner, but maybe you should cater it.
Here, pick these up!
What's wrong with you?
Well, I guess because I'm a little psychic...I have this thing.
Why doesn't that surprise me?
Let me guess something. This is your first visit to La La Land. You're staying somewhere over in Hollywood because, like an idiot, you thought that would be an exciting place to stay. Right so far?
Oh, Rosie.
Poor baby.
They can stay for two weeks. I don't care.
You're just on a higher plane, Wilson.
I'll call you from Detroit, baby.
You're going to miss Mexican Halloween. The Day of the Dead.
It's better to be free, right?
Dream on, Auggie. She'll be lucky to make it to her nineteenth birthday.
What kind of man does that!?
Where were you?
The city? New York City? Why?
Jack...don t even start...
Good.
I don't have much choice, do I? It's pretty clear she doesn't want me around.
Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe.
I'll get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing I do.
I know... But you do look so silly.
I can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.
Oh!
I always like to see the funny side of things. No sense crying when you don't have to. And you're so funny. Looking at you, I forget all about my toothache.
I've got a brush in the closet. As soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry - you just brush it off.
Thanks.
On the chiffonier. Here.
Where's the towel?
You're going to tell me that you had a good time with the old lady.
No, it doesn't. I'm happy you're being honest with me.
I don't care anyway. I want the coffin to be white. And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink.
Perfectly absurd.
How much will it be? I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich.
It is not. Get out.
This.
Squids?
But that doesn't solve the problem. Who is doing this? And why?
...because if you don't, they die...
The other side.
You going to ask me in?
Read the card.
C'mon, these are the Bomb, I prom...
Sure. I was just doin' my nails.
He was going to--
Oh, please. Destiny's just something we've invented because we can't stand the fact that everything that happens is accidental.
Are his folks nice?
Stand by with the battering-rams...
-- We have to talk to her, Viktor!
My clothes?
I know.
Sure, Claire. If you don't mind walking my way.
You fuckin' guys and your dicks.
On what. What makes you so certain.
There's the phone. You want his number.
Can't you do it out here?
Oh, no. I'm watching my figure.
Morning after?
Must they always follow us?
But you're not fat, Mrs. Rieper!
Dressed?
Your Aunt called me.
I'm going to pick up some friends of Carl's. Are you all right?
It's all right. He don't mean anything by that.
Oh, am I holdin' up dessert?
I do eat slow as a bird, whereas Bobby can put it away like a speed swing... Is there any ketchup around?
I was afraid of that.
You don't care. do you? But hundreds of thousands of people will carel
See, you didn't believe me!.. Now I suppose you don't think I have the courage!
Thanks. You too. It was great working with you.
You think I made that up about the gun...
Can I sign yours too?
Yes, Paul?
So what's going on with the Spring Dance? You have a date yet?
No one's forcing her.
That's okay?
Just try and chill a little bit, alright.
I'm sorry. It seems every hour I have to...
Yes. Thank you.
Do you like it, being pregnant?
I know. It was the same when I was carrying Will. Like clockwork.
I hope everything is settled.
Good. Why don't you join us?
So what's your personal thing? Are you really going to tell me something personal?
I don't know, he just said he wants to wait. I quit asking.
Yeah, actually, I do. But John doesn't. At least not right now.
Kids? What about them?
Yes! Yes! I think that's very true. Very.
Or, or I could always wear this one.
Yeah, brothers are lined up at my locker.
I found you someone.
It's okay, dad.
Look out for number one. Always number one. I should've known you wouldn't tell me. Pop said Johnny Friendly used to own you. I think he still owns you. No wonder everybody calls you a bum.
Fine.
Excellent. Couple of Swedish sailor cells just gang divided a virginal cheerleader cell.
If you have to work...
Test?
I am, really.
All right already.
What?
Peter, you couldn't even fix our TV!
If I ever loved Narcissus it wasn't like you want.
The fans of Narcissus. They were on vigil outside the school of Proximo. They believe he's dying.
What are you talking about?
Taking my pleasure. Do I need to clear my lovers with you?
Why are you so surly -- you've won, brother. The people have bread and the city is quiet.
Well, in that case...
No, we're paying for the wine.
I'm having the salmon.
Could I trouble you for my glass of milk?
You could have treated us like they did in Aspen. No. You wouldn't do a thing like that -- it isn't in you to be mean or cruel.
You don't have to explain. Did I tell you how grateful I am for what you've done?
Is anything the matter, Mr. Mayor?
Do you remember when we met at the bar? ...You were wearing a tuxedo.
How'd a Japanese guy get a name like Hans?
I think he kind of liked me...Is that so hard to imagine?
Hey look, it's Sausalito.
Really?
This looks corny.
All right, then. He's interested in you for your conversation. We know what a great talker you are.
Not anymore you don't. Doll.
Planned what?
Mr. Bixler, I love you.
If you believe that.
What happened?
What happened to Charles Gish?
Tell me.
You're sure of that?
My God. How I'd love to see that.
No. It's all right. I just meant, it might be a little dull for you, telling all this to some housewife in the middle of nowhere.
Well, it's kind of buggy out there.
Very early in the morning.
Suzette will be back here any minute.
Shall I see you again?
Suzette will be back here in a minute.
Can't -- can't you -- Couldn't you come too -- I think it would be better -- for us -- for us both.
Bobby...
This has nothing to do with you.
Royce. We're the same age, we started the same time -- and now you're sitting in the upperdecks while I'm still down in the bullpen. What does that tell you about the Navy?
You need operational duty to really advance... you need combat training to go operational... yet combat training is off-limits to people with tits. I'm topped out at Intel. Forget the glass ceiling -- I'm beating my head on a big brass ceiling.
Just like you would be.
I take it you don't either. Feet.
You have to be experienced to do this. Just wait outside. Otherwise, you risk killing him.
I'm gonna need some bread, man. This ain't fair. I'm always here for you, and you can't even take decent care of me. My landlord is bitching like a motherfucker! You're two months behind on the rent, Lieutenant!
Why don't you ask for another one?
... my friend doesn't like it here either.
Well he's not exactly a friend.
I know.
For climbing.
You did, didn't you?
Benjamin -- what's happening?
Have you decided about Pilgrim?
Doesn't matter.
Well... how you feel all right about telling Liz to put him down...
What about him?
I think that's... very compassionate and... mature way of looking at it.
I think we should. It's not fair to let him suffer. He's not much use anymore. He'd hate living like that.
Mom?
What?
Maybe they should put me down too.
And I have looked down the road. At what my life will be. And I can't handle it.
How much does it cost?
Huh?
I suppose... when you were able to marry her she'd have presented you, all shiny and proper... she always tried to be proper.
We're going to register. As man and wife. And get shown to a cabin... and then search every inch of that place, inside and... outside.
You going to wait here for me?
I believe it.
No, Harry, it's not time, it's us. You and me. And I'm telling you now that I'll come to you, okay? I'll find you. I will.
Yes you do. If you love me you can wait, right? A month, six months, whatever it takes.
Oh please, Harry... don't even think it. You're the only person who ever... It's just... Can't you wait for me?
I know, but... There were so many people in there, Harry. Every time I turned around someone was pressing against me... watching, looking over my shoulder, touching me, grabbing, sticking things into me. When I feel somebody near me now... anybody... my skin starts to crawl.
Yeah. I don't know.
What have you been doing here! Huh! I wanna know! What have you been doing here?!
Come on, a wuss like me? The stiff who wouldn't help her own daughter fight back?
Really? Is he cute?
What?
What's wrong with me?
Gross! You must remember to tell me this in the morning. I'm, like, so freaked out now.
Bullshit! If you're going to hurt me, you hurt me now -- not some long... drawn out hurt that takes weeks of my life because you don't have the balls!
Hello, Sam, this is Dr. Marcia Fieldstone on Network America.
All right, Jabez ...
Is he home right now?
Well, I think I can help a little more if I talk to him directly.
You want me to talk to him?
Perfect. Sandbag the father.
I'm sure he won't be angry once he realizes how concerned you are about him.
Too Christian. You know Jameson? Paul Virilio?
Seriously.
Dad I'm kidding, you can have the room.
Great stars have great pride.
Twenty-four isn't young. I'd already been goin' out with him ten years when we got married. I've never been with anybody but Darryl.
It's okay. He is an asshole. Most of the time I just let it slide.
Deep down. Way down.
We could still talk, you know? It's nice to talk.
You're a grown man. I'm not responsible for you.
She has all the cooking talent.
Ohhh, but I've eaten five of these.
What? You're kidding!
No, no, we decided!
Perfect!
Mmm...I mean, we love to cook for our friends, so we thought until an acting job comes through, we could just make some extra money, you know, doing a few private parties.
Why are you doing this to me?? Do you get pleasure from hurting me?
I... I was defending myself as best I could! Everyone has the right to defend themselves, don't they? Or should I have let myself be killed?
No, I do not think so. I don't think that killing each other will ever bring peace.
Go away. Go to that girl of yours.
You like the way I cook...you think I make out a great invoice. PHIL You and Nick and...and this...this garage are my whole life...I love you. Sure you don't have the greatest taste in music...but there's not another woman who could look so sexy in that smock. What I'm try... what I'm trying to sa...
It must be the altitude you, bucking around the countryside with a lot of boot and saddle boys --
Well, does everybody love us now? You've been gone long enough to soft soap twenty editors!
Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane?
Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so.
I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me?
I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry.
Bye Aunt Rose.
You know what I'm talking about.
Yes, Patrick?
Oh no. I have no plans.
Anywhere you want?
No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
I know. And now?
What are you doing.
Go back to sleep.
This could be it!
Yes.
Nice, Jack. You re sweeping me off my feet.
Aren't you ever tempted to gamble?
I can just imagine, being around so much money all the time...
You have four seasons, you have four slumps.
Really?
You're famous around here.
I said... I started.
What did you say?
'But keep dancing, and if you're lucky, I might just never leave, who knows?'
Well, now you know what it feels like.
WHAT?! How can you -- I'm sorry if my friendship with Tom bothers you so much, but I happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what I say, it's wrong and no matter what I do, it's wrong... I'm sorry I'm such a disappointment to you.
FOR YOU! Because I'm your daughter which means you're the best mother! Isn't that what you're always talking about in interviews -- having it all, the great career, the great family... Proving everybody wrong. Wanting everybody to think you're this perfect woman!
I don't deserve that. I have never looked at you as a disappointment. If I'm on your back to do better, if I push you to try harder it's because I want you to be the best you can be.
Yeah, well, you've done a great job.
Listen, if... if there's a part of you as parent that... that takes pride in your child -- that, you can look at them and see something you've accomplished as well... if that's wrong, then I'm sorry. But it wasn't my intention. I don't push for me. I do it for you... So you don't waste half your life feeling like you don't know where you belong.
LEAVE ME ALONE!!
Well, then I do apologize... But what I'm most sorry for is turning you into a spoiled brat who can only think about what she's feeling... who can't admit when she's wrong and who can't forgive when she's not.
A virus called Da Vinci will cause oil spills at 10:30 AM Eastern Time tomorrow.
We need your help to overload the Gibson so we can kill the Da Vinci virus and download the worm program.
John Doe, the one in the speech.
What's the idea?
You know something? I've actually fallen in love with him.
I think so.
I don't know what you're going to ask me questions about. You may ask things that I won't want to answer.
I guess I'll work as a waitress, Buddy. I done that before and it got me in worse trouble than you could know, but I can't stay here no more. Why did you get rid of your rabbits, Buddy?
Why?
-- we are?
What's wrong?
Johnny! Why didn't you tell me before?
I'll take care of it, Johnny. I'll take care of the whole thing. All you have to do is show up.
Roy, I don't want money from you.
You do?
No. That was the point.
No can do. Have to dip in and out of my bag too much. Besides, it'll heal in the air.
You want to get out of here?
You wanna get out of here? You wanna leave?
No.
He's Canadian.
So you can shoot a pistol?
If you said yes I would have had a reason. You should let me redress those bandages. Before you go.
Because we're fine here. I don't know what Mary told you about me, but I don't need company, I don't need to be looked at.
There's a man downstairs. He brought us eggs. He might stay.
- guilty.
For instance - you!
Stop calling her a kid! It so happens there are particular aspects of my life to which I would like to maintain sole and exclusive rights and privileges!
Stage-struck kid... she's a young lady - of qualities. And I'll have you know I'm fed up with both the young lady and her qualities! Studying me as if - as if I were a play or a set of blueprints! How I walk, talk, think, eat, sleep!
What about her teeth? What about her fangs?
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter for the juke?
N-no. I wr-wr-wr-write... I wr- wrwrite...
I think she'll like this very much.
For that matter, I think you will too.
Go on!
Of her acting, it is absolutely impossible to say anything except that it represents a new low... Have you got that, Mr. Bernstein? In the opinion of this reviewer -
It isn't here, Mr. Bernstein. I'm dictating it.
Get me a typewriter. I'll finish the notice.
You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
Who, Levi --
Can't we just ice them along with the rest of the citizenry?
As a team, the duncely duo protect each other. But the Robin is young. Impetuous. If I could get him alone-
The way to a boy's heart is through his ego. What strapping young hero could resist his very own...signal?
I'm hungry. I think I'll have poultry.
The pages are gone. That's real.
Dyslexic?
There's no such thing as tough, Creasy. Just trained and untrained.
I'm going to keep people safe someday. Just like you.
I could do it. Remember the day you wanted the pencil? I know why. And I saw that car again. I wrote the license number in my notebook. Except I missed the last number.
Don't worry. It's really solid this time of year.
I heard you were -- what's that adorable phrase? -- "at Her Majesty's pleasure."
I'm worried about you.
Are you coming to the theatre? Oh -- I shall dance tonight -- How I shall dance -- I want to feel that you are in the theatre.
No?
Why do you think --
They've brought me such good luck -- you --
Relax a little, okay? Take off your jacket.
A fine bunch of reporters. Biggest story in two years and they're too lazy to go after it.
Are you all right, now?
I like the way he dresses.
"The wrong hands"? We're not talking about military secrets, John. They're just tapes that he makes so he can sit around and get off.
What's so stupid about it?
Right.
I...
I... yes.
They lied.
I do. Yes.
Not really. But I knew this narcotics cop one time. Told me that in a raid, the whole package never gets back to the station. His exact words.
You don't propose something like that unless you're pretty sure the other person's into it.
He's setting me up to make a proposition.
Maybe. But I'm thinking it might be something like he wants the money for himself.
He weren't bullshittin' either, 'cause later he was suspended and forced to retire.
Look, I know this is your house and all, but do you think you couid keep it down? I'm trying to read.
Please, if I start talking --
Why do you keep playing at being so humble? It's a little embarrassing.
How do you know I am playing? Well, the clown is always harmless. Isn't that right? And how did you ever get to know me so well? The last we spent any time together I was fourteen. I think you know me better than my father. He's going to die, isn't he?
Of course I know -- who do you think is paying for it? The Emperor himself, didn't you know? Why do you think Commodus came rushing up to the front? Burning patriotism? Filial love? He wants to be sure when he takes over there's enough cash left in the treasury to... play Emperor. Watch out for him, Narcissus; he's inexperienced, but... be careful.
It is. Honestly.
Hello.
It's not for the. They only get to convict him.
Panes is not on my team anymore. I'll have Panes if I like.
Ryan's novel.
I thought I could handle it. I didn't want to bug you. I thought I could handle it on my own, but I couldn't. She's in real bad, Auggie.
Where are you going?
Sam, I'm going.
Naw! He wouldn't have cared. Just give him a good performance and he'll be happy and I've got a feeling you'll do just that.
It's all right gorgeous. Something wrong?
Sorry to trouble you, Coco.
Good luck!
I hope I'm back in a couple of hours. Don't drink all the coke.
Okay.
When I get back I'll have the cab waiting, so be ready to go.
We have a gift?
An hour! Or less!
I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry.
Of course we do. We have to sign our taxes.
You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you!
I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental.
I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't.
Yes, air.
What is Rose going to do? Where can she go?
What are you saying? That a women's life is more valuable than a man's? That a women's death hurts a family more?
Excuse me, Mister... I'm looking for Mister Rubens' apartment, but it's dark out here and I got lost...
It's cool departing this way... warm... music...
...I'd like knowing what he's listening to...
A princess?
No.
Alex.
No.The guy's dead.What more do you need?
Should probably ask him that.
I've been waiting a long time to hear you say that.
How'd they take it back at headquarters?
Just take my word for it... if she ever finds out about this I'll never hear the end of it...
Because if you do, I'll kill you!
Where have you been? I've been looking all over for you... I've been wandering the streets day and night trying to find you...
Boo!
No, actually Joe told me you were here... so how come you never call me anymore?
Now, 'limp dick', I know. What. Is 'snowballing'?
I live for the moment.
Miss you, too. I have been seeing someone for a little while.
You're not exactly pure Bud, you went after Gekko with the same vengeance you went after me. Look in the mirror before...
I'm sorry.
Oh, sweetie. It really does cut both ways. We were taking each other for granted and --
You made me have you erased! I loved you. I love you! How could you --
So... you haven't been involved with anyone in all this time?
It's about the Director.
You graduating this year will be proof that miracles happen.
Don't tell me now. Tell me right before the test. I won't be able to remember long enough.
Okay, this test is going to be about the theorems I told you about last week. You remember the...
Noooo...
Richard, they'll find out your record. It won't be safe for you here.
You didn't do your homework?
Why there is no other man in my life?
Yes?
Well, only one answer can take care of all our questions.
That's easy. There was. He's dead.
Yeah, it's been a while, but I... I remember the basic ideas...
Poor thing.
The answer's no.
Your card says Hutu. Take our children, go and get the twins, pay money at the roadblocks. Get them out. Please.
Oh, but you don't know how big this thing is. You should see the thousands of telegrams we've received and what they're saying about you.
Look, John. Something terribly important's happened. They're forming John Doe Clubs. We know of eight already and they say that there's going
Uh-huh. To carry out the principles you talked about in your radio speech.
No.
Don't say it. We're both ragged out right now.
Missile!
I brought your hat. You... left it down at Greely's.
What?
And what lesson have we learned from all of this, Babe Br... Sam... I mean Samuel?
Some of 'em you didn't mean but most of 'em you did. I don't blame you because I understand your way of thinking and why you think that way. You want your women on pedestals. But they have to be born on 'em -- they can fall off but they can't climb back up.
Why?
What? That's horrible!
Shut up, will you? You sure? Nobody?
Hello, Max, Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady --?
Yes, intentionally.
Tell me!
Hold on! Don't jump if you can't see bottom!
So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?
Frankly, this looks kind of stupid.
Madison? Isn't that kind of... I don't know, gay?
What's wrong with him, David?
Benjamin?
Let's drop it.
No.
I have my reasons.
Yes.
Nick, the ice is --
I will do my duty, my lord.
Alright... I promise to rest if you promise... to go back to the battle.
What's the matter?
Oh, yes -- yes -- that's right --
In the bedroom.
He's here. Check the bathroom.
What are you doing up so early?
I'm supposed to be mad at you, but I'm not.
Uh...using Josh like that.
Yes he did.
What do you want to know?
I'm an asthmatic. Been one all my life. Can't go anywhere without an inhaler.
Are you trying to rap to me?
He wants you to come and see him.
I don't care if my clothes are taken seriously. Or my car.
Had dinner at a place called the King's Table. Buffet style. It was pretty darn good.
Look, just light the candles with me. Then we'll eat. You have to eat.
He commands it whether He exists or not... Look, we can fight him and be crushed. Or we can submit.
You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says "vacant-occupied, vacant- occupied, vacant-occupied" --
Come on, we can be like Eichmann. He studied Torah. He hated Jews.
You just - Just stop him.
Guys ready to order?
... I'm about to surrender the Horn of Plenty for the Horn of Gabriel, my boy...
Yes you do. You know exactly what I'm talking about. You're afraid I want to hold onto you, and I do, but you're not ready... at least not for me.
Because one shouldn't fall in love with creatures from the sea.
I'm going back home.
That's easy. Me.
In three months! Papa.
Stop it, Wolfi. I look dreadful. Welcome to our house, Herr Mozart.
Oh, yes.
I assume she's the virtuoso in that department. There can't be any other reason you'd marry someone like that.
That's what I need to ask you. You know you can't keep anything from me.
What would it mean, anyway? If he didn't write it?
You know you don't have to sneak. You could stay with me. I know Things, Wyatt. Sweet things. I Could make you so happy.
So I assume we're regarding this As just a kind of interlude.
You feel bad about this? About me?
George . . . George . . . George . . .
Then I'm free to go...?
Please... I'd like to go...
Of course not! Am I acting as if... something's wrong?
It is to be expected on a Sunday.
I am going to church.
He is dead?
Mourning? Who is dead, my lord?
I'm sorry.
In a minute. When I get it together.
A page-break signal. A period.
No! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go.
Don't be absurd. You'll be killed.
What?
I'm not telling anyone.
Then make it stop...
Nothing could be better...
Psychiatrists would say that you are confronting your demons
Where is my mother! How oddly thou repliest! Your love says, like an honest gentleman, Where is your mother?'
Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
You gonna die without a son.
Marty, I don't want you hang arounna house tonight. I want you to go take a shave and go out and dance.
Thomas. He told me it was a very nice place.
Marty...
You gonna get married.
You were bleeding inside, honey. Remember that bruise you had?
I'm working down in San Diego. Just for a few weeks. Thought I'd drop in on my long-lost son.
FUCK DANA. I'm sick of Dana.
Can you at least let me in?
Look, I just need somebody to be nice to me for five minutes and then I'll leave you alone.
Helen, she sent along your things with a note, and John here, he wrote to the police.
I don't know. I thought I did. Now I'm not sure. I thought it had something to do with me.
They'll kill you. You won't make it ten feet before they cut you down.
Come on, Mickey. Come on.
What are you saying?
I've heard of them.
About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
What report? To whom?
It was for my report.
Probably not.
You probably won't believe me.
What for?
That's all.
You were just looking around...
I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
Who is it?
But why in the Lord's name would you do it in the middle of Easter Sunday when you knew we were...
You're missing most of your life, Jim, and you don't even know it. The kids are missing out too. It's not just you making the sacrifice here, honey.
Don't you dare, you'll never hear from him again.
Does Doug care that you're seventeen?
There... There's his car. I know he's at work tonight. He hasn't come into Swenson's since he called my house. My mother told him I was still at high school, after I told him I was nineteen. I guess I should tell him I'm fifteen.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
But your face did!
Doug sees beyond that stuff to what the person inside is like. That's why I'm marrying him.
If he ever calls again I'll say I'm eighteen.
Mr. Andrews, thank God! Where would the Master at Arms take someone under arrest?!
Put your napkins in your laps and eat up.
No! I'll do this with or without your help, sir. But without will take longer.
I'm gonna start rolling --
You mean like couples?
Ok. So, lemme just ask you a couple questions to start --
All it takes is one second?
Yeah, like people in love.
Are you having boy trouble? I gotta be honest; I don't much approve of you dating in your condition, 'cause... well, that's kind of messed up.
Dad, no!
No, I thought it was funny. Forget it.
Andy, you're not horrible. You're just... complicated.
What're you doing?
Not around here. This is a rough part of the world. Hard times, not a lot of money, not a lot of luck. It's a challenge, staying healthy in a town like this. Heck, even our dogs up and die.
I'm not surprised.
Your unfaithfulness -- that's what I'm trying to talk about. Your unfaithfulness. Your betrayal. Your dalliance. And you won't do me the dignity of being up front about it.
It wouldn't make a pleasant evening, if that's what you're after. I don't want to talk about it. Stupid mustache cup.
For what?
Hi.
Who do you think's been paying the rent?! Who helped type your script, and did all your grunt work?!
Like what?!
I wanted you to say, "No! I wrote the part for my girlfriend Dolores."
No treasure maps, huh?
Michael.
What?
What can you see?
No.
I want to be alone.
Refresh my memory.
Come to the rescue again I see.
They used the hex chrom here, in these cooling tanks, as an anti-corrosive. Then they dumped it here, in these six ponds.
Why not? I need to get in there!
That's okay. I understand.
Jaguar's a darn pretty car.
Why?
Well, I'm sure she kept her word and left you satisfied.
Is it over 'cause you're sick?
All right.
Did they ever find out?
With a family?
I'm glad.
And it's all over now.
You've always hated the animals.
I'm giving them up. I've changed. I've found a new focus.
I'm getting rid of the fucking animals.
I'm getting rid of the animals. I've lost interest. Besides, they're standing between you and me.
Us, of course.
I have to be up early.
Let me pass!
What about now?
You never met a working girl before, have you? You think I like sucking off guys all night? Maybe I do. So what? You can't even say it, can you?
Who is this?
Hello?
What if it is?
This is serious! I don't have my license. He was my ride.
I've seen lots of people. It's not a big thing for me.
His parents took his car. They're making him ride a bicycle the rest of the summer.
He asked me to tell you that you owe him a hundred dollars.
I'm coming in.
Is it over?
Do you think I'm strange?
It's 1:45, I told you there's no one to pick up Annab...
Which part of no don't you understand?
I've got it. It's in the can, Cooper can wrap th...
More like a mystery... Which isn't bad. It's just kinduv...mysterious...
Don't.
I told you when we met I never wanted children. I don't want kids in my life. We talked about it. You weren't listening.
Paper or cloth?
How's it going?
I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan.
You are a therapist, right?
What's the larger experiment?
Ah, it's over! Elliot, I mean it. It's over!
Here I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion.
I don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. I just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry!
Look, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery?
Oh God, I am such an utter fool.
I think it's because they fear death.
Oh. What about?
Well, hey, that's, that's nice. Uh. Oh, listen, this is, uh, Alvy Singer. Do you know Alvy? Uh... and... uh... Tony Lacey.
Don't shit where you eat.
It made me think of what you told me once. In five years, the Corleone family will be completely legitimate. That was seven years ago.
Yes, Michael, it does.
Sleeping inside me.
Hey, we qualify for the Senior Citizens Early-Bird Special... Did you see Tommy today? He misses you...
I'd like you to switch to the day shift, Mike. To be home for dinner. Helen insists that T.J. be home for dinner... That's why he's on the morning shift.
I watched TV.
I don't remember Michael, go to sleep. You don't have to make conversation with me.
I already did. I mean, I talked to his wife, and she talked to him...
Rust?
Of course I'm not here -- because the whole thing never happened -- I never took those pills -- I never loved you -- we never even met -- isn't that the way you want it?
That's right--
Do you want your coat? It's cold out here.
You better be careful. You'll get a stroke arguing.
He is just being like all parents, concerned about the ones they love.
You mean, after I'm dead?
It was just a job, there'll be plenty of others.
Yeah. I'm working on a masters in horticulture. Chipping away at it.
Like me, I have this stupid paper due on Friday, and as usual I'm freaked out about it. Just like in high school. It never changes.
So is it kind of about death and mortality, or...?
Oh. You mean... today?
What? I'm a pawn shop rocker.
I rock a Harmony.
Yeah.
What is that, Mahogany? What happens if you crack the neck?
When was this, like '96?
No. I'm looking for what I was put here to look for: the back door.
What guy that died?
Why not do it in the Colosseum?
It's in your script...it's about getting a second chance. Innit? "You can go back..."
What do you mean?... You've been acting strange lately... Like the other night.
Why haven't you called me?
What's happening to you? What happened to your face?
Okay.
No.
Why not? He's a good press agent and a good friend. Besides, we've shared a lot of headaches
Yes. So I've noticed. Jerry's noticed - He'll come up with something.
It's called "Burger Manifesto, Part One The Dialectical Expression of Testosterone." Isn't that a great title?
Come on, Bobby. Time to go to bed.
I don't know how to thank you.
Ted, I can't...I tried...I really tried but...I just can't hack it anymore...
I am not! I'm a terrible mother! I'm an awful mother. I yell at him all the time. I have no patience. No...No. He's better off without me. Ted, I've got to go...I've got to go.
He had hoped that someone would be playing it still--two hundred years from now.
If you'd read what he wrote, you would have left with him too.
You know how much those Well Child exams cost --
You are a single mother. You have given up the right to be frivolous.
I don't have to do what you say.
For how long?
You did, I know you did.
He likes you well enough to stick around.
How many is that, six? Pretty hungry, weren't you?
Well, nobody asked yuh.
No, no, no! You can't take pictures of him like that eating a sandwich and with a beard!
We don't have to talk at all.
Are you going home?
What are you going to do now?
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.
Well -- where are you going?
The FBI finally gets around to talking to him in Dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant Communist type.
I don't want you to go anywhere until you have a definite plan.
None either. It's bizarre. It's next to impossible to get Russian sweethearts out. Nor does Lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to Cuba and Russia in '63. A man who has defected once already. It's crazy.
We're just having a little drink.
Why are you doing that?
Take it. damn it!
Okay, down boy. I can't take this for driving you home. I wish I could, but I can't. So here, take it back. I could have just left it for you at the desk, but it's very valuable. Now take it.
I'm saying he asked me out for coffee, like a real date, when was the last time you did that?
Oh, sure okay.
No, that's not a date, a date is when I don't cook.
Diz!
What!
No, but I know what he means.
Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor blindfolding a whole State-- Wait a minute! If that's how he wants to play I'll get through to that bunch--I'll get plenty of words into that, State--! Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've written--let me have it--
Cosmo's cheating on me.
I need to confess.
You can touch me, I won't bite.
...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me.
Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second?
Oh no!
It wouldn't have made any difference.
You did not know?
You and he are not doing things?
Yes! You know?
That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.
You don't have to make conversation with me, I'm not my mother... do you have a thing about older women... that's sort of faggoty isn't it?
I never get my hair done.
You think that's funny, don't you?
You live a phony cheap cop-out existence.
The simplest thing in the world: I want to have a lot of babies with you. Dear Heart, I love you.
Norman.
Be careful.
Did you finish thinking?
I think better when I drive.
Okay. I'll call you back. In an hour. Don't tell Darryl.
Okay.
You mean, the guy who turned blue and wet himself... ?
How'd you know?
They've started the battle without me!
I'm not afraid of struggle, Clifford.
Then show me! That's what I'm here for, to learn, to grow!
I'm not!
Okay Mr. Sultenfuss, you got a deal.
I promise i'll take good care of these people, they deserve it, they're dead, all they've got left is their looks.
Ohh, oh sure it's no big deal, you see all my former clients will eventually die, and all your clients used to be alive, so they have something in common.
Oh wow, a real evil canieval.
Turn over your weapon, Edna!
What, and get myself beaten up again?
Not much.
And that'll make me feel better?
No-one.
Camera, Chucky. Are you Bernard LaPlante, sir? What is your relationship with John Bubber?
You know what they say about the early bird.
Good morning, Mr. McAllister.
Thanks, Mr. M.
And all this will be for real?
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?
We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
And how do you explain that?
Uhh, no.
-- You just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. Maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows? She certainly doesn't need you. Some people even say you're holding her back.
How much wine have you had?
You?
Every actor is an invention, Viktor. Don't embarrass yourself. No one's denying that you discovered Simone. But it's like finding a diamond in the desert. Anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.
No one else that I know?
You're drunker than I thought. Are you doing that again?
No, no, I don't think that, Juno. It's just that, we went through a situation before where it didn't work out.
What do you mean? You mean... Do you think I'm going to flake out on you?
Um, I think people are kind of unsure about the situation because it's not, you know, set in stone.
Why?
I thought people got all that stuff at baby showers. When my stepmom had my sister I remember she got about a million presents. They were all lame though, so I wasn't jealous.
Oh it's just some stuff I picked up. For, you know, the baby. Babies need a lot of things. I want everything to be just right.
Seance.
You should have gone to China. I heard they give away babies like free iPods. They shoot 'em out of those T-shirt guns at sports events.
Well, how would you define to parties"? Because we ordered a deli platter at this one Denominator drill session--
Well, you should.
Is this the treatment?
You've got a funny idea of funny.
No.
What?
You're cold.
You didn't even see it.
I'm so glad you could come. Here we are, all together again.
Why are you doing this?
Well.
But it's your birthday.
Good morning, Dad.
He looks plenty big. You won't need my help if anything goes flooey.
How are you feeling, Mr. Jimmy? How is your mind today?
I am not forgetting your last brief chat.
Almost a Christmas scene.
...You all right?
Okay, see ya... Thanks, Ray.
Hello?
Ray?... What time is it?
Wonderful. Uh...
What's the chances of MANTAN being picked up?
Oh, sure. Great.
Why did you even come up with that shit if you didn't want it made?
Fuck da money. Why do through all this effort? Why? Are you looking for love from Dunwitty? For respect? Dunwitty and his likes don't give a goddamn about you. So now what are you gonna do?
Hi.
Want me to?
You going to answer it?
Why yes, do you know it?
George...
You're a genius.
No.
Because I don't want one.
Yes. That will be company for you.
No! I'm not gonna do it! If I don't dress like this for Mom I'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!
Why can't we just EXPLAIN IT?
I must have frightened her away.
Um ... It's ...
The kid. Junior.
Not until the last drugstore has sold its last pill!
Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!
Well?
Please. I look a mess.
You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here!
Anyway. Come already to the point.
Look, we don t have time for this right now, we ll talk about it later. Now get dressed... You re not wearing that to the Thompsons party. I don t care how hilarious you think it is...
I hope you don't mind my speaking to you...
Why should you be? After all, six nights a week - for weeks - of watching even Margo Channing enter and leave a theater-
I've seen you so often - it took every bit of courage I could raise-
Not at all.
You're Margo Channing's best friend. You and your husband are always with her - and Mr. Sampson... what's he like?
To speak to just a playwright's wife? I'm the lowest form of celebrity...
He's the best.
Bill Sampson? He's - he's a director.
Oh, no. I see the play.
He'll agree with you. Tell me, what do you between the time Margo goes in and comes out? Just huddle in that doorway and wait?
I have to go -
Don't make me tell you, Jason.
It's beautiful -- that searchlight - the stars --
Jason, I'm going back to Highcliffe. I came to say good-by.
Ellen.
You know what? Why don't you just pick me up here? We could all share a limo.
Well, she was in a weakened condition... I don't know! What about "King Kong"?! Is that medically possible?
Happy. And he won't want to see you.
Better today than tomorrow.
I shall also be needing a war horse -- mine is too slow -- and armor -- and a good sword -- and an artist to make me a banner.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
Kris Kristofferson.
I'm finished.
And they have very mixed feelings about women. They hate them in a way. One reason they like war so much is that they can capture enemy women and not have to make love to them slowly and gently. They can scrog them, as you say-- for revenge.
Double-crossing swine!
It's complicated and I don't want to go into it now, because it's bound to sound insulting--even though nobody means for anybody to be insulted. It's just the truth.
Well--part of it is that heroes basically hate home and never stay there very long, and make awful messes while they're there.
Well, I can. Some injuries, spiritual or physical, can be excruciating to me. I'm not a silly carhop any more. Maybe you're right about fish. When I was a carhop, I didn't feel much more than a fish would. But I've been sensitized. I have ideas now--and solid information. I know a lot more now--and a lot of it has to do with you.
The whole concept of heroism--and its sexual roots.
I'll go on the dole. Like my daddy before me.
Well, I'm there. I hide in the back as much as is humanly possible. You have a cell phone? I need to quit right this minute. I'll call in dead.
Jesus, is it five years? I gotta quit right now.
Ucch, really? You're kidding. God. Bizarre small world, huh? Yeah, that's me: book slave there for, like, five years now.
Ah, the hair. Blue, right? It's called Blue Ruin. The color. Snappy name, huh?
About what?
Well, they must be something sexual, because Ann gets freaked out by that shit. Are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?
Oh, okay. I think I get it.
Doing what?
Well, either you are or you aren't. Which is it?
Mr. Guild means guests! Oh, there are two more to come.
I think we may as well sit down.
You're the flower lady.
You're a great help to a hostess. I wish I always had you for my dinner parties.
...All I remember is how she loved the bottom of burned bread. Her little hands...I wouldn't know 'em if they slapped me".
He's so...it's too much...and I can't...I can't breath...
Shut your hole, Slutnik.
Uh-huh.
Nick! He wants to know how to rob it, and he'll leave you alone! That's all he wants! I hate him, Nick... you know how...
No!
I thought we'd have a few more days.
He said he wanted to talk to you. When he found the letters... he said "when your boyfriend gets out, I wanna talk to him." I thought he meant back in Detroit. I thought he meant --
I care . . . your father cares . . . we want you to have a good education.
Who cares!
It's a letter from the school . . . from Miss Stewart.
My name is Gina!
She says the standard of your work is slipping. At this rate she doesn't think you'll get School Certificate.
Another hour of so. We've got enough food for a month.
How much longer is it gonna be? I'm hungry.
I don't want them to love me.
Then what difference does it make if we stop? Come on. I never get to do stuff like this.
Isn't this fun?
You should be going ... the primaries are soon, aren't they? New Hampshire ...
Were you planning to tell me?
Yes, Mister Harding?
Yes. Now was there anything else you wanted to discuss, Mister McMurphy?
I will willingly swear to tell the truth about earthly things, but as for my revelations, I've never told anyone except my king... Charles the Seventh... the one and only king of France.
This is just temporary. I once made nine hundred in outcall.
Up front?
Make it nine hundred. That was my best week.
When do we start?
This is different. This is nine hundred dollars.
Oh my God oh my God...
Victor, have a care! You'll make him dizzy!
Dad!
Dad...
Hey, this one's mine, this button. This one, you rem-
Stop... just stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before...
You're getting farther away all the time. It's a duck.
Excuse me, Mr. Kane. I know this takes a lot of nerve, but - who are you? I mean - I'm pretty ignorant, I guess you caught on to that -
I sent Bobo ten grand of my own money, like it was the winnings from my bets. I hoped that would cover me. It didn't.
Terry told me about Wonder Boys. Is it true? Did you lose it all?
Hey, Miles, I heard you came by the restaurant last night looking for me.
Dozens. It's very sad.
I had class.
And you're old.
Oh?
You want to start going over who they could have gotten? They can't take on people like this for network news. For God's sake. What's going on?
Hey?
I know. He's wonderful, isn't he?
That was my choice, nothing to do with you. I took a chance, and it didn't work out.
A chicken?
We have to do something.
The first day of the Delmar meet, there was a nag called Bluebell. I should have been on it. But that was the day after you came in here, so I stuck around to see how you were gonna be.
We can fight. That's what we're here for: To fight the Iraqis. To help the Shi'ites, and the Khurds.
Yes, but why?
Who could love a man who keeps jumping through burning hoops, like a trained poodle?
Lloyd, we shared the most intimate thing two people can share.
I knew it! I knew a night's rest wasn't possible in this house! Hubert!
That infernal phone!
I came second to the NBA. I'm not about to come second to this bullshit scouting job.
When?
You. What' you're doing --
Is that so bad? It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy. For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would . . . do things for him. I guess I'm no good that way. I guess I tried to sucker you along like that. Do you hate me for it? I wouldn't blame you if you did. But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
John, if you don't throw me the keys, then I'll just walk away. Walk away and leave you here.
I think it worked out okay, don t you?
Maybe you re not. The Jack Campbell I married wouldn t need a 2400 suit to make himself feel better about his life, but if that s what it s gonna take, then buy it. Just buy the goddamn suit ...we can take the money out of the kids college fund.
Well...Annie for one.
He's a good man, Tom is. He's got a gift, come from heaven above, I swear. But he's still a man. And a woman can lead a man into the middle of a mountain lake -- and still make him think he's on dry land.
This is Mr. Booker, Robert.
What?
Yes, it does.
Listen, I'm sorry I --
I thought we were just having a conversation. You seem to be reading all this meaning into it. Meanings I must be too simple to, uh... interpret or something.
What made you ask such a question?
I don't have any sugar either.
I don't mix with the boys. I work here. Let's keep it professional.
Apology acknowledged.
There you go with those moves again.
For what?
You're the one talking to the walls!
Do something...
Got any requests?
Damn, Lena... Who is he?
What is it, Norman?
That's too high. I'll never reach it.
The door needs a lock.
Then someone was in with you. Who was it? -- Who was it? I'll answer that -- Hello ... hello ...
I never had it.
Hey -- Doug Stallworth? It's his loss.
There's a world of guys out there. I just wish I didn't have to date any of them.
Dartmouth?!
We're only going to be here a few hours...
Credit card.
Put that back.
Sir . . . If I should accomplish this mission I mean might I perhaps win my wings? I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir and people are beginning to talk.
Sit down? What are . . .
He's dragged me into every gin mill on the block.
I thought so. He even tried to drag me into the gentlemen's --
No. Ours was damaged.
I'll tell you... ... l-a-t-e-r.
Way to go, Mom!
You're too goddamned paranoid.
Leave him alone, Tran.
We have nothing to talk about, Lenny.
No, Lenny.
You were good.
You were good.
All I said was you were good.
What's that supposed to mean?
Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
Richard, take it easy.
Ricky Hendricks has to cancel today. He didn't say what he was canceling or why.
Late?
After six.
And...Spencer wants to meet you for a drink at Fluties Pier 17.
Oh? And what should I say?
I love it!
Joel!
Thanks, Joely. A present! Oh boy!
Um...look, there's something I've, uh, that's been bothering me for a long time, and I just thought I'd just tell you what it was and just sort of clear the deck here, and that's this.
Good evening, Wilson.
It's all right.
That I've always regretted the way I behaved that evening we went out, and, uh...I've, I just thought I'd tell you that because I really made a fool out of myself.
... I'll feel so relieved after Dr. Allenby examines your leg. After that, David can run you on home, or to your office or wherever you'd prefer... ... Is there anything special you would like to watch?
Oh... Well, I'm very sorry...
I admire that in a person. As for myself, I find there is so much to assimilate that it can become quite muddling at times...
I can see that it must be very important for you to stay informed of all the latest events.
Ta da! Pantyhose! The death of the garter belt! Of course, once they're manufactured they'll look better than this. What do you think?
Don't tell him anything. He can't do this.
P.M.
No.
We could cross-reference a data base on media ownership. But not on our own computers. Not even at home.
The mainstream media. TV, or a newsmagazine.
I'm sorry I... yelled at you. Was it yelling? I can't really tell. Whatever, I'm a little out of sorts today.
My embarrassing admission is I really like that you're nice. Right now, anyway. I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm going to like. But right now I'm glad you said, "that's okay" to me. That was nice of you.
It would worry me.
What would you be if you asked Adam and Ryan to run in now and hug you?
Do you think it's odd your kids don't hug you?
But you only wore mascara when you and Daddy went on romantic dates...
Well Daddy and I are just friends now, and that's no reason not to wear mascara...
Then why are you putting on mascara?
I'm a little tired and it's just a pick-me-up.
Or blush. You look pale.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, but you must have a majority to change ward policy.
But there are eighteen patients on the ward, Mister McMurphy.
I'm sorry, Mister McMurphy, I count only eight.
Everyone in favor of changing the schedule raise his hand.
Pointing upwards Look...
You don't got half what Tehronne got.
So, I've been spending a lot of time listening to that weird CD you made me.
Wow! It's magical.
Well, when you're used to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges, everything else sounds kind of precious by comparison.
I sort of like it. I mean, it's cute.
Consider it your musical education.
Shh it's all right - I'll be all right.
It's getting dark. I can't leave now.
Hold up, hold up, I'm getting shots over the scanners, tons of traffic -- jus' chill for a sec, lemme listen...
Girl one of these fools has an FBI badge on him! Is this the one that was doing the inspection?
You call this... glory...? All this... this blood... this smell of...
Take a little walk with me, huh?
Did you know when I was a child we had pretty near five hundred rabbits?
Hi, Buddy. How's my sweetheart who never told on me when I was bad?
Jake, is that you?
No... not like this...
Don't be silly. Hi, Jill.
I'm just cleaning out some of this stuff that's built up. For the rummage sale. And some things for the cleaners. And the laundromat.
But how will I ever know, Louis?
It's midnight, Harry. My glittering raiments are dissolving.
Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else--
What are your plans in New York?
Yeah, if I don't make too big an ass of myself.
Well, I... didn't bother to read the article. I didn't think the picture did you justice.
I wish I'd never met him, I'd like him to be dead... I want my friends back.
He can help you.
Some vague promises of a test, that's all - if a particular part should come along, one of those things-
Tell me. How did your lunch turn out - with the man from Hollywood?
I'm not crying.
Eve... don't cry.
He's not my friend. You were my friends...
Well. I think you're painting the picture a little darker than it is, really. If nothing else - and don't underestimate him - you have a powerful friend in Addison.
- an understudy's performance.
But the raves about your performance-
Shhhh --
Speak it like it's real. Matthew.
Say it and you'll believe it. Life is good. Say it.
I'm sorry, Nick... I'm so sorry...
How do you think you're going to make a living?
Yes. I try to keep my power.
Yeah? Then gimme another raise.
From citizen high to citizen low.
Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what? I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you.
And talking is talking! Well, I think we better get on.
...this is magnificent.
Oh, anywhere downtown.
Well, you've asked.
I mean, maybe you're right. But were you really expecting me to say yes?
I've changed my mind. That's the most romantic thing I've ever heard. I do. I will.
About what?
So?
Tell us about the other guys, the ones West weeded out.
Are you saying Sergeant West tried to kill you?
What's the scene...
He's my teacher!
Nick, listen. From Clyde Wynant! "Will you take charge of investigation on Julia Wolf murder. Communicate with Herbert Macaulay".
I'm ready.
You should have. I don't like leaving things unfinished.
You don't mean that Clay.
Tell me, darling.
What does a man usually tell a girl?
Oh, geez, yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Only -- only I'm not leaving, Walter.
Thanks.
On the nine o'clock train. That's the one he took, isn't it?
No, he won't. I wired him that I wasn't coming.
Some kind of animal?
What do you do for a living?
If you could have seen your face when I told you good night! You looked so, so... Ah!
Roy! What are you doing in San Diego?
If you come out to the track, don't know me.
What's that?
You got about thirty seconds.
What is that?
Whatever, big head.
I'm scared I'm slipping back.
You have to say that.
Sometimes, when I feel weak, I have these...visions.
After, after the operation, when that poor girl, she went in a coma. Dr. Towler called me in. He told me he had five difficult deliveries in a row and he was tired, and he never looked at the admittance form. And he told me to change the form. He told me to change the one to a nine. Or else, or else, he said... He said he'd fire me. He said I'd never work again....Who were these men...? Who were these men...? I wanted to be a nurse...
I thought I would need it.
What a beautiful ship!
I'm sorry, it's just you hear stories.
All right.
I walk out.
Benjamin, this isn't a very interesting topic.
He's asleep.
Oh please, don't shrink me, Norman. Not now.
I've been helping for the last few days. Weeks. Sam's working. I told you Sam was working. I mean, he really is.
Don't... don't do this... please...
After the kids are back in school.
I'm helping George build his house.
I'd love to drive through New England in the Fall.
Thank you.
Natasha! Natasha Feastavich!- but we called her Nashie Fooshie!
College. Haven't really thought about it.
So does it look a lot different?
And I love poetry above all.
Wow. You ever see her again?
I know, honey, an' just as soon as we get settled Al's gonna set out an' look for him. How 'bout gas, Tommy?
What'd she sing?
One more day, baby. One more day to Christmas.
Just don't fucking tell her.
You need to knock off the pills, Clair.
I don't know who else to turn to, Auggie.
They must've bought the same map we did.
You know Sophia. She's so damned judgemental. And she's so damned... perfect. And so fucking... serene. Just fucking don't tell her. Because you know Mac thinks she's God. And I can feel him comparing.
...as long as they're ready for the opening I don't care, just tell them that.
Why would she care?
Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it.
They were just bad men, that's all.
Watch your step, Siri. Your grant could be on the line here.
Now, what did I do to deserve this?
Well, apparently it was a big mistake to try talking to you. Don't you remember what we promised to each other? Honesty - trust!
Martin, it's not funny!
No!!! No!!!
I'd say it was down.
No. I'm just not tired. Let's go.
I'm not sleepy anymore. Let's drive for a little while longer.
Do what?
Can I have your credit card number, followed by the expiration date?
Hi, this is Janice The Operator, who's this?
Hi, is this your first time calling?
I don't know if I want to.
I'm telling you, you sounded great. You, uh, you may be surprised.
Are you sure?
How bad off is he?
We better call the doctor... Listen. I'll say how it happened, part I saw.
Listen, maybe we ought to tell somebody about this.
Oh, uh, listen, David called me up.
That some of the folks around here are more programmed then me.
Her leg was shattered so they had to, uh... remove it. She had some bleeding but it's under control.
You may never remember at all. Your mind's grasp of reality and the real events that have happened to you has been damaged.
You should be careful. You could be killed if they found you out here.
So it's helping?
What a honeymoon.
She said she had a full meal one hour before coming to the hospital.
"Bring me a side order of Mrs. Wheeler."
What's the matter with you?
Yes.
You should be here when they bring in a body that's been dead for a couple of days, and they haven't found it yet, 'cause it was in an apartment, and no-one came to visit, or floating in a river, and then the body starts turning this weird shade of green, you know, like watery pea soup? The arms and legs deteriorate first, the body looks like a raisin with four fat legs. Anyway, this is why I'm seriously considering cremation. Judy??
No, surprise, I thought you'd be--
You were attracted to me?
Yes...
You got a bet on the game tonight?
A better friend.
How long?
Reluctant to speak, eh, Chauncey? Well, I can understand that. When a man loses everything, anger has a tendency to block out reason for a time. Just give it some thought, work with the idea, I'm sure you'll have plenty to say in a few days.
It's not. It's happening to me.
I don't believe this is happening to me.
What did I do to deserve this?
Well, it's not a turn-on for me. I have a promotion coming to me. I don't want to get AIDS.
... No, of course you don't. Excuse me for being so presumptuous. No man knows everything about another man - however, very few are honest enough to admit it.
What is ridiculous? Wolfi has many admirers in Vienna. They love him here. People send us gifts all the time.
Well, this is none of your business. Whoever sent you is going to pay, no?
Not a lot, sweetie. It's a country. Like Canada. Only smaller.
You'll be up to your armpits in meatballs, I'm flying them in from Sweden.
I still don't think it's loaded.
Even if all this were true. There're 20 other buildings. All of them filled with computers and --
Milo. Why would he --
"Like this?" It's Gary you're talking about.
You're scaring me. I think we should just go.
Irrigated his face with the shot of J and B I'd just poured him. Then I tried to deck the sucker.
Checking out time is three P.M. Hotels of this sort aren't interested in you when you come in, but when your time's up... Sam, I hate having to be with you in a place like this.
When you're married you can do a lot of things deliberately.
I tricked you into meeting some people you'd think were great. I thought it would be fun to introduce you to someone with a Tina Turner album and then see whether you still felt the same way.
You're fucking desperate.
You don't want that. It's married and it's the neighbor.
Would it make a difference?
I love you, Joe Therrian.
I know -- I know -- but it will be sunny in Tremezzo. We'll have a guest then.
Oh, the sun -- it will be sunny in Tremezzo --
You mean --
God! And why didn't you come tonight? We all had a terrific time. I really think you would have enjoyed yourself.
Mmm, what am I gonna do with you?
Yes. Good luck, Mister McMurphy.
Certainly, Mister McMurphy, with pleasure.
Are you sure?
Irena.
Look! Why don't you run out and play? The sun's shining.
What's her name?
Irena.
Where'd you get this, darling?
She tells you you're ugly?
Yes.
And that you're stupid?
Yes.
That you're a mistake?
She says my whole body's a mistake.
Why?
Because she says if I don't watch out I'll have a baby.
How does she know that?
Her headaches.
When they watched at all. Do you like movies?
Does it bother you?
With Jennifer.
Well... are you self-conscious about it?
We're driving out to the country tomorrow night. Just the four of us. Bill, Margo, you and I...
It's going to be a cozy weekend.
It's not funny, Jim, I'm scared.
Darling, there are so many complaining political speeches. People are tired of hearing nothing but doom and despair on the radio. If you're going to have him say anything, why don't you let him say something simple and real, something with hope in it? If your father were alive, he'd know what to say.
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Oh, don't pay any attention to me. I guess I'm just upset about all this. Gee whiz, here I am with a great opportunity to get somewhere, to give us security for once in our lives, and I'm stuck. If I could put this over, your Mrs. Burke can have six babies!
If you're thinking of that thousand dollars, forget it. It's practically gone. We owed everybody in town. Now, you've just gotta stop giving all your money away.
Well, yes, I know, dear, but these people are in such need and we have plenty now.
What?
Well, honey, of course I don't know what kind of a speech you're trying to write, but judging from the samples I've read, I don't think anybody'll listen.
Yeah, I don't know. I simply can't get it to jell! I created somebody who's gonna give up his life for a principle, hundreds of thousands of people are gonna listen to him over the radio and, unless he says something that's, well, that's sensational, it's just no good!
Do you mean the speech you're writing?
... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it...
I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- !
Townsend believed, just as God became man in Christ. So Satan will assume human form. I believe it too.
You first.
Are you suggesting we wait till someone finds us?
You pull me up.
Well -- when did you decide all this?
When did you two talk this over?
The Ottos.
Okay.
What kind of man are you?
What point?
You do understand that there's absolutely no way I could ever be attracted to you, right?
This is the straight hitting on me you were talking about, isn't it?
Imagine what it must have been like for them out there. What do you think of Dunbar?
You're off to a late start.
Well, thanks for your help Mr. Rosenfeld and I'm sorry my mother wouldn't go out with you, I'm sure she would have had a really great time.
When he made his decision, he couldn't have known everything. Especially not the way people like you do, who've returned from exile and feel that you have a right to pass judgement. Because you are blameless, you think you know best who is a sinner and who deserves forgiveness. But you have no idea how people lived here.
He'll remember my mother for sure. STANLEY It was a big class Vada and...but...well of course he'll remember, who could forget Maggie?
It's not the press that matters. Nixon's wife is proud of him.
I was worried.
You're a little too fast.
I understand you perfectly.
Cotton Company --
...weight into the balance...
The iguana.
How come all those guys who're looking to get 50 from the Church haven't come up with shit? You got some kinda inside track?
I wonder if I hang around with you because you're like my surrogate mother figure or something. Like I have this subconscious biological need to be nagged and bitched at constantly.
Yeah.
God, how horrifying.
Whose truth are you talking about?
Just...leave it alone.
Quincy, please...
Guess I should have been telling your father.
Well, I --
Yeah, come on, play it.
You OK out there?
Thank you. What time is it?
You OK?
I like hearing you talk. If you feel up to a short walk, there's a place to eat around the corner. All the food in Vegas is terrible so the place doesn't really matter. How does that sound to you?
And no elbows on the table!
You're just the President of the company, what do you know? ... Come on.
Gekko asked us into the Bluestar deal. We're reviewing the timetables, wanna come?
We've tried so long to find her.
This is definitely better.
This is entertainment you're making, Toby. This story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this Brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.
Back. Neck. Back.
I don't know what I'm doing.
I could die.
Of course it's alright.
It's alright, isn't it?
Of course.
Um, I-I didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor. I-I just, you know, I-I-I wouldn't want that.
There's a goddamn sign on the gate.
I'm sorry.
I think it's great that I made an impression at all, you know.
I...
I've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...
What, is she black now?
Somewhere downtown.
We're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.
"Funky"?
I believe that to be an accurate description of the events, sir... albeit there is a certain poetry to the language which...
But he was called...
I can't do it. What's the point?
Truman, that was our house!
You can't just not show up like you do, you have to go.
You can't be late though.
Seriously.
I'm serious.
You can't be late.
Here they are.
I got all my signatures. One hundred and fifty-eight -- way more than I need!
That isn't true. It was about your father. Where is he?
Where are you taking me?
Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
That slut!
It had a hole in the floor. Where are we going?
Why? What did she tell you?
What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
Do you know where he's living? Oh.... Well, at least I'm glad he's all right. Thank you for calling. Goodbye.
Oh God, that's great!
Oh, I'm fine. They've replaced you with quite an entourage. It's a regular "marching band". You should see me on the street, you'd think I was the First Lady --
I'm taking them all out to Queens, as a matter of fact, right in your neighborhood. There's an event at my Father's school... an anniversary... I thought maybe you could come...
I'm going away after that, the next morning.
Pretty far. I'm told not to say anything about it on the phone, in case it's tapped... they think it's best, safer, if I go away, at least till Venza's found.
What is it?
Ted.
It's delicious, trust me.
You're not listening to me.
Yeah, well, I can't relate to humanity either, but I don't think it's totally hopeless...
Six years. Ever since Ted and Joanna moved into the building.
But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend.
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now.
Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years.
No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair.
Did you say you were thinking about adoption?
Okay, this is no laughing matter.
Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him!
About what?
I can't leave my job, George.
Remember this beach, Mac? All those summers. Out two families, together.
Dad, why are you acting this way? Is this because of the other morning?
I can't. Look -- this job -- it's the best thing that ever happened to me. I mean it. For the first time in my life, I got people respecting me. Up in Hinkley, I walk into a room and everyone shuts up just to hear what I got to say. I never had that. Ever. Don't ask me to give it up. I need it.
You... You found that at Leon s?
Do you have to call me that?
Come on, Mr Lombard. You tailed your man all the way here from Europe. You told me you knew where to find him, remember? Or didn t I hear you right?
Sure.
Shit.
It s give and take time, Mr Lombard. You need help, we need information. You didn t really expect me to put my ass on the line helping a criminal just for the thrill of it, did you?
If you have hard evidence about a child trafficker, we want it, Mr Lombard. And we want it before you get yourself killed...
You get what you pay for.
I'm going into town... run a few errands before dark. Need anything?
Bye Will.
Oh, Jesus, they've stopped.
Look at all this shit... I know a fence... he'll give us money and get us passports in exchange for this and the car... We can go anywhere.
Not too quickly.
Only in mutual advantages -- moreover...
Perhaps.
Moreover -- Do you mind if I smoke? I went to Florence once, too.
No.
I don't know. I do know that people who are possessed have to accept evil in some way. I don't know if it works the same way in this instance. I don't even know when it's going to happen.
You understand. Consider, before you laugh and say no. You will never own a throne, though you deserve one. But just as the sun will rise tomorrow, some man will rule England. And what if his veins ran not with the blood of Longshanks, but with that of a true king?
I have taken vows. More than one. I've vowed faithfulness to my husband, and sworn to give him a son. And I cannot keep both promises.
No. But can you love me for the sake of all you loved and lost? Or simply love me... because I love you?
I hope I didn't keep you from something.
Objection!
That's very important to you, isn't it? Home.
Pops
We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
Yes.
We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
Look, I'm sorry, but it's important to me. I mean, a week ago I was wishing he was dead. And now I want hear his voice again, just once more-- you know what I mean?
Not as good as Nino's.
My father was a great man, you know. There was nobody he wouldn't help. You know that crazy guy Noel who I gave water to last night? He lived in our house for almost a year. A total stranger he'd do anything for, his own family though ...
To keep out the cold.
Benjamin -- you're -- I don't know what to say -- you're --
But you're not enrolled.
Yes.
Benjamin -- I would like to know what you're doing here.
I thought he said by the monkey house.
I know what ice fishing is!
Your friends use the pool too.
Why can't you do it?
Hey! That's my line!
Come on, Linda. It's just sex.
So tell me, do you like Ron? Is it serious?
Brad! Have Mom or Dad seen this?
Don't strain yourself.
I know.
Smell the air. Wonderful.
Prouder still. You'll be the handsomest student there.
Father's so proud.
You will. What do you want, Victor?
There are some people I'd like you to meet. Can you come to the Musil district at eight o'clock?
What, are you trying to handicap me?
Nobody told me anything.
I thought you wanted to be a writer.
Then you can write anywhere. Let's get out of here, while we still can.
Not gonna let me in?
...thank you.
'How do I know it's true? You'll get to be the champ. They'll all want you, all the girls! But I don't care. I've been undersea a long time. When they'd put their hands on me I used to say, "This isn't it! This isn't what I mean!" It's been a mysterious world for me! But Joe, I think you're it! I don't know why, I think you're it. Take me home with you.'
'But how do I know you love me?'
You think I got it?
How's it sound?
Yeah. Yeah, tonight I think I got it.
Hello, Harold.
Feeding my fish.
I told him not to tease those bees. Did he get stung?
Maybe I should go over and yell at him.
Why not?
You mean to tell me, a mugger would stay away from someone because they walked a certain way?
You put it back in the wrong place... Do you like Renoir?
You know why they're like that...? He was myopic... going blind.
So, this could be your last night, huh?
Want to go out for a drink? I mean, we're both sitting here, and Joey Venza's in jail...
Ensign Monk want to know how you feel.
8500 feet, Bud. Everything okay?
Just thought I'd stop by.
What else?
He's a brave man.
Fine Fidget. What's all this?
Oh yeah, stay here? U-huh.
Imagine... I'm sleepin' with a DT.
Hello, Win.
You like Patsy Cline? I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records.
I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick.
Yes, sir.
Fuck you.
I ain't even goin' dignify that. You my road dog. We threw up sets. Plus you stank.
She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.
I'm loyal to things that make me happy.
But how do we explain the fact he was in prison?
Uh. He thinks his nose is too big. But it's not.
Great. Big ears, too?
No. But they stand out, a little. Like this.
No, baby. You're gonna use my words.
Like a popsicle. They're keeping him on a stick until spring.
Help me here...
That's right: 'going steady' for four weeks now.
I won't be that long.
Then help me understand. You know, you're not alone. A lot of Gulf Vets have begun to experience curious symptoms. What you have might well be a syndrome and, if so, it's not one we know enough about to be treating it this vigorously.
Well, what time is it?
Tell the king to give me more men.
You want me to wait for you, you'll be back --
Then what good is he?
It's not just inner beauty, is it?
No.
The W.C. Fields Fan Club Newsletter... Oh my God, The National Psoriasis Foundation!
What should we do? What if he recognizes us?
Bingo!
Come on, it's too late now...
Ew, look at this...
I don't think he sees you as a guy guy.
A job for me?
Bonanza Jellybean?
Does that mean you might have an assignment for me?
I know he wasn't much of a father.
How do you like this! You don't suppose that ranger met up with some kids--and took 'em for a hike!
What?
Um ... You gotta turn off Main Street.
You're not.
I am always on your side. And I think you should talk to him.
I'm sorry.
I hardly know him. He wanted me and he couldn't have me.
A minute ago you said you didn't care if he drinks.
His bag. You know that ratty green thing he's always carrying around. He must've left it inside.
It won't be that hard.
I'm working on it... I've got a few leads... it's just that right now I have, all these projects that take up all my time.
Nothing. Don't worry... I promise I'll get a job next week.
Yes?
I'm Erin Brockovich, from Masry Vititoe?
Like what?
Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
Someone's following me.
God, I can't believe you went to Anthony's without me.
Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.
Will you get off my back for once?
Boy, this job takes me to some of the best damn places, huh?
D'you get his name? Course not. Jesus, Ed --
Caesar, what are we going to do?
Some apartment somewhere. But I've never seen it.
If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
You must think I'm some kind of fool.
You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong.
How's the food?
That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
You're right... I don't. I just need to know that this thing is out of here! You hear me, Roger Ramjet?
Everyday.
They have? Thank you, Max. Tell Mr. DeMille I will be on the set at once.
Cameras? ...What is it, Max?
I'm fine, sir.
Nothing. He's like you, he doesn't say much.
...He sent me to a psychiatrist to see if he could calm me down some.
Psychiatrist said I was the healthiest person he'd ever met, so Marty fired him.
Well, I didn't see him anymore, I'll tell you that much.
I said, Marty, how come you're anal and I gotta go to the psychiatrist?
Please. Maybe he'll take a good look at you and stop thinking so much about his horses.
Go on. Have another try at him.
What's the use.
In general.
Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
Is it a girl?
Oh -- I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.
Whatever it is you're upset about.
Will you take me home?
OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
Yes...
I thought we were against ownership? I can stay tonight.
This is a different world - is what I tell myself. A different life. And here I am a different wife.
You bastard, I was believing you!
Phreak and Joey are being framed. We need your help to figure out what's on this disc.
Read it.
What is it with you? I know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. I really need your help.
O.K.
Bye Mrs. Sennett.
Hi, wanna ride bikes?
She was crushed. Feel her skin -- it's like sandpaper.
She said, "You know." That I know.
I have to show you...
Yes. Like I was putting them into my big basket. Clearing the hillside of its children.
That's the way I thought of them sometimes.
Abbott and I used to do a lot of that in the spring.
But Stoltzfus said...
Father!
That's it. I'm gonna have to tell my little brother, I'm gonna die. I can't make him his lunches anymore.
Shh. Come on, it's gonna be OK.
Maybe. I don't know. I just know that when all this was happening, I felt, some part of me felt...alive. Like somebody needed me. And the more I reached out to, it, the fuller it became.
You can't put her out, I promised... Margo, you've got to see her, she worships you, it's like something out of a book-
The heave-ho.
Well... there's one indoors now. I've brought her back to see you.
They're nobody's fans! They're juvenile delinquents, mental detectives, they're nobody's audience, they never see a play or a movie, even - they're never indoors long enough!
She's just outside the door.
You've what?
Yes, it is! You're talented, famous, wealthy - people waiting around night after night just to see you, even in the wind and rain...
Ain't it the truth?
They're your fans, your audience-
Autograph fiends! They're not people - those little beast who run in packs like coyotes-
What did he say?
Do you have another tie? Something more conservative?
There's a phone in the car.
Can we go then?
I don't know, I'm very confused right now.
We need your help.
I look terrible.
Some discussion.
Yeah.
I remember you.
steps back.
Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
The thinking is, as of this moment, Terrorism... ...they're getting a Good Reaction on the "Albania" thing...
...I'm not certain I'll have a career at all, and if I do, I'll probably be a veterinarian.
Two weeks work gone for nothing.
I want to say something to you without you blowing your stack.
Jake --
Who's going to want me now?
I said I would get you to your ship and that's where we're going to say goodbye.
Where do you think you're going?
Long enough. Fifteen years.
The Master wants to know if you are free for lunch. I tell him you will be having other plans, but he insists I ask.
Yeah. Should have seen me seven years ago--when I came to this town. Now what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied Piper of Jackson City; Honorary appointment! Scratch this thing an you'll find they wanted a dope here for two months.
What! Who?
What is it?
Yeah.
Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
No !
Why not?
So you've done it --
I never mentioned the word before. In his agony he grips a glass standing on the night table.
You got me something? What's the occasion?
Yes.
Have you ever loved anyone?
Love.
Second thing that comes to your mind.
Right now?
Well, who in particular?
Everyone.
Who?
I love you.
Uh huh.
Walked, in all that heat? It's a wonder she hasn't got sunstroke. I'll phone Daddy and you go get Doll Baby and Waski.
What?
I can't hear a word you're saying!
Weather's been awful. All those bombs dropping. It changes our weather. Sure not like the good old days.
Keep warm, dear. Let me hear from you.
I ran into him at the 76 station on little Santa Monica, what was I supposed to do, hide in the ladies room? Yes, I was talking to him.
He killed him, Sheriff! I couldn't stop him! He made me come with him. He told me if I said a word he would kill me too.
Never needed one. I've never been anywhere. I've got a backpack.
You look like... Brian.
Like what, a Porsche ? A Ferrari ?
Just seems weird they didn't chase us.
Oh look, I haven't got time to be Proper, I want to live. I'm a woman, I like men. If that's Unladylike then I guess I'm not a Lady. At least I'm honest.
Where'd they go?
City-dwellers never do that--for fear of what might drop in 'em.
I'm freezing to death.
No, Phillip, no. We must be strong. You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards! Furthermore, you can have the phone now.
As for instance?
We could make some paper boats and have a regatta. Or should we just turn on the shower?
Are you hungry?
Phillip, you're mad!
Fact. Andrew Beckett performed at a consistently mediocre level. Fact. He made a grievous error on a multi-million dollar lawsuit... Fact. He claims he is the victim of lies and deceit. Fact. Andrew Beckett lied to his employers, going to great efforts to conceal his disease from them. Fact. He was successful in his duplicity. The partners at Wyant Wheeler did not know Andrew Beckett had AIDS when they fired him...
You're an enthusiast.
Those days you could always find something redeeming about even the worst person.
I was afraid to go to Marcus Bottom because of him.
We're supposed to be at home David! We're supposed to be in color! Oh God ...
Okay, now you listen to me! I don't know what's going on but you'd better fix it! I had a date with Mark Davis and I even bought new UNDERWEAR!
Play along?
What's all over?
Hello, Miss Channing.
You know this is adultery. You Burn in hell for that.
I'd like you to have them.
And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would.
I'm quite all right, thank you.
What am I looking at?
They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
Eve... ... by any chance, did you place a call from me to Bill for midnight California time?
Oh, golly. And I forgot to tell you-
Whose orders are these?
We go together, Nick. Wherever... we go together. Remember?
I'm going to the market.
How long will it take you to get home?
Yes.
I didn't mean... with me. Alice and Silky, they'll give you one... if you want.
Please don't go there.
You're the one that put us together. We're friends.
He's just playing big brother.
I don't want to hear it.
It was Fort Sumter they fired on-
I never played Fort Sumter.
Honey chili had a point. You know, I can remember plays about women - even from the South - where it never even occurred to them whether they wanted to marry their fathers more than their brothers...
Within your time, buster. Lloyd, honey, be a playwright with guts. Write me one about a nice, normal woman who shoots her husband.
You need new girdles.
Buy some.
That's mighty black of you.
Hello.
He'll let me stay, Mrs. Farren. He'll let me stay.
It's very simple. You go your way, I'll go mine. Thanks anyway, Travis.
No, I don't feel so good. We're just two very different kinds of people, that's all.
Keep it.
I'm getting a taxi.
That you're afraid --
No, sir--
No. I'm going home.
Patrick don't call me pumpkin anymore, okay? I have to go.
I know. Stop it.
Uh huh.
Yes?
Ummm . . yeah. Luis is calling me tonight. I need to be home for that.
Look, I'm very sorry I came off sort of nutso. I'm not really.
Wilmont. Near the high school.
You know Wilmont?
You can't be too careful. I've been stalked. I've been told I'm highly stalkable. I don't need that.
So you like bookstores, huh?
Now you've got me worried, dear. Promise me you won't butt in.
Oh now, don't be silly.
Say Matt, you haven't done anything about what you saw today, have you?
What's keeping you?
I don't know...
I deserve a lot worse.
Ouch.
It's not your fault. Mrs. Kagan called dad and blamed us for what happened to Lenny.
But it isn't bad weather now.
Comes night we'll get outa here.
But, Al, it's the bunk! Norville showed me his design for the whatsit the day I met him! Why Buzz couldn't have invented it -- look at the man -- he's an imbecile!
Elliot!
What are you doing?!
Did you ever read this one--?
Elliot! Don't!
How long you and me known each other?
Alive.
I didn't. I got a job, too. I wonder if that hurt her, my not letting her sacrifice for me? Some people are so willing to suffer for you that they suffer more if you don't let them.
You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director.
Really? I need a drink. Come hide with me.
Oh, I love that. I'm just great. I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you. And I'm so happy you asked me to. I'm so touched. I know how private you and Sally are.
When I read your work I felt that you knew me. Women must tell you that. And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know? I am Genna. How many women must tell you that. And the script is wonderful. Wonderful and lean and visual...
Oh, Jesus, Panes. I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house.
Thank you.
You know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. Guess he just don't think it's safe for me.
You a preacher?
Of course she did, Norman. What else could it be?
What are you here for?
Well, that's me.
This is totally unnecessary --
I want a huge cookie. And like, a lamb kebob. Simultaneously.
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?
Right, seriously.
She's gonna steal that kid for her collection.
You sound shocked or something.
I just thought she'd look really old in real life.
I have friends.
I respect him. At worst he was a worthy enemy. Show mercy... Oh thou great king... and win the respect of your own people.
I have come to beg for the life of William Wallace.
I can't bear the thought of your torture. Take it!
Drink this! It will dull your pain.
You will die! It will be awful!
Hello... Yes. We'll be back...?
You're terrible. I'm never telling you anything.
How long you been in this town?
I think it's like... inquisitive.
Man, you see him a lot. And it's very wrong to reveal it. Next you'll be saying what his problem is.
Four months, two and a half weeks -- that's how long. And you've already got more patients than those other two shrinks combined.
I don't know. I guess it's cause my sister Nicki had a baby when she was like 15. She was really young so my mom is like very protective over me.
It's wonderful. I mean, you know they just watch movies all day.
What, are you a klansman or something?
Wow, this is so cool...
It doesn't matter, I'm not staying long... I just want to make sure I convince you not to give up yet.
What the fuck, Seymour?! What is this?
I dunno... because I can't stand the idea of a world where a guy like you can't get a date...
If Chet sees you, he'll kill you, don't you know that?
Knox! what are you doing here?
No wonder... wait... Agnes... Agnes how do you feel about babies?
WHAT?
She was kind to me. She told me I was beautiful.
You liked Sister Paul?
She said all of God's angels would want to sleep beside me if they could. I liked that.
Sister Paul was in her eighties? Did she climb up here often?
If that child comes here...if I find her trying to steal your love from me...I'll kill her. Yes, I'll kill her:
Who's that man?
I quite liked it. I wasn't as enthusiastic as everyone else.
So I see.
Where'd you get all that information?
I guess at this point I'm what the French call 'de trop'...
The little witch must have had Indians runners out snatching critics out of bars, steam rooms and museums or wherever they hole up... well, she won't get away with it! Nor will Addison deWitt and his poison pen! If Equity or my lawyer can't or won't do anything about it, I will personally stuff that pathetic little lost lamb down Mr. deWitt's ugly throat...
Eve?
How can you call it a good thing? A graveyard for pets killed in the road! Built and maintained by broken- hearted children!
Extraordinarily morbid, maybe.
Well, I thought it was safe--
Uh - I just, I think I'm gonna barf.
Come on, Jonah --
Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
Where are you going?
Okay, so we got a state trooper pulls someone over, we got a shooting, and these folks drive by, and we got a high-speed pursuit, ends here, and this execution-type deal.
Say something surprising. And funny. Lie, if need be.
Yeah. Could be. Go say hello, Romeo. Looks like a healthy non-mutant to me.
What?
Yeah ... That--and ...
Did you?
Have you seen him?
Where's Connell?
Oh. Gee, you're swell! Oh.
Oh, let me go, will you!
It doesn't matter.
You and the Colonel go back.
You're the Tom Hardy I've been reading about in the papers, right? New Orleans PD fired you for taking bribes from Guissepe Torres.
They did the same to him as they did to you.
I think he might be worried.
Yes.
Doesn't matter. We're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.
How's the mother?
What's happening to us?
It wasn't his fault. He thought it was his only way back. They fleeced him real good.
You think I didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? You think I couldn't figure out some low blows?
I lost him. I was panicked.
Look -- those are the first metals that came through.
Yeah? I was your waitress on your birthday. Connie told you about C.R.S. that day, remember? I was already playing my part, before you started the game.
Nope.
Like what?
Oh, let's not talk about my hair, it does what it wants to, and anyway, who cares, I want to talk about you...
Well, you're not going to run out on me right away, are you?
Where is my son?
People might be better off. They thought about it, spent the evening back in the...
That's not wh...
They made her so sleepy she couldn't work.
The animals made her sneeze and cry too much.
I smell gas... Do you smell gas...
So you may have been duped this whole time. Killing innocent people, that must make you feel ..., how does it feel ?
Then how come Matt and I showed up as guilty ?
What do you mean ?
Yeah, everyone has to when they get hired.
Oh, yeah...
Well, maybe your version of growing up is 'Just win, baby'.
No, he isn't.
No.
Neither.
Go ahead then.
Don't you?
Then you'll be wet.
What month?
I knew you walked this way to work. I wanted to find you before they did.
Yes, I do.
Oh. Well, I live--
Ohhhh!
Oh, I was just going to my AA meeting. ELLIOT Oh, my goodness. Well, why do you still go to those? You never tough alcohol.
Well, listen, you didn't know me before Frederick. I'd...I'd start with a beer at about ten in the morning, and...go on.
But what I decided to do is some writing. Yeah, I think I've had it with acting. You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls. And I can't handle another rejection. Now let's face it here. I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life. You know--something with a future. I'm not sixteen anymore. It's just...crazy! I've got...an idea for a story. More than one. And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even.
So why, after Dunbar drags Kendall out from under a house, does the Senator's son try and get us to put his savior in the gas chamber?
Well-well, like what?
No. She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department. That-that can lead to other things.
I'm not! I'm not! I'm trying to be helpful. A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress. Now I'm a writer." I mean--
Yes, you are. You're very sick.
Oh, ha, ha, ha.
Do you think that's funny?
That's stupid.
I admire that, you being true to your wife. I've seen a lot of... of men... who weren't.
Sra-I'm-sick. Sick - kiss I'm - my Kiss my! Sra-I'm-sick - Kiss my arse!
I know. Help me get a sample.
What is it?
Here.
I think so.
You can have what I've got. It's right there.
This is a nice place. It must have cost a pretty penny.
Oh you do, huh?
I hope you save a little somethin' somethin'.
'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending. But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself. I deserve nice things.
No. No don't feel like Clarence Thomas.
Yeah. It depends. Cause like this one time with Eric, when we got blasted at his house. And Smash J and DJ Flipper was there...
And we were blasted, and he must have been dumb horney. And he just pulled me over to the bed. And they were in the room, like getting dressed, like getting ready to go to go to Disco
And we were like underneath the sheets. We were going at it like crazy. Oh my God that shit was so good! It was like hard...
He was like sucking my tits. He was fucking fingering me. But that shit was nice and hard.
I will not have it butchered.
Good luck it didn't happen a few miles back. Maybe they never would have found you. Day like today you'd be dead for sure.
I mean, how could you not play anymore? That's so strange to me...
Hi.
Yeah, but sometimes kissing the losers can be a fun diversion.
Look. You're way under 30, you're cute, some guys find white Carter's underwear sexy If you talk to his nose, you don't even notice the eye.
The right guy is out there. I'm just not going to kiss a whole bunch of losers to get to him.
Okay. If you've never kissed a guy, we got bigger problems than the underwear.
I've kissed guys. I've just never kissed a guy. Felt that thing--
Betty.
Yeah.
About six months.
Yeah.
No, no. I did.
Yeah. Yeah we get along well. You didn't get along with her very well?
When did you ever care about getting to school on time?
Darn it!
Thanks. Don't worry Evan, you'll have plenty of time.
You know the answer to that.
We've been over this a hundred times. It's too dangerous for him.
What does that mean?
The point is, you've got to find something new.
What happened?
It's been a while. I thought maybe you'd be in touch.
Almost done. A week or ten days, and I'll be there.
I don't need you to "stick."
I took advantage of you and worst of all, I'm not alone. I did this with a kid. I was just on some ride where I thought I was in 1ove enough for both of us. I did this. And at least I can do something about it now.
It's not fair to you. This whole --
It's my fault.
...Where is everything?
Gabriel!
...You leaving?
Well, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.
Ted Sheldon.
You were? I thought you were chasing me?
I guess so. Then what happened?
Poor baby. You know that's not true.
That was -- different.
You got no manners and you never tell the truth! You're nothin' special. And if you ask me, you got no chance at all of being an officer!
I don't know who you think you're talking to! I ain't some whore you brought here! I've been trying to be your friend and you treat me like shit!
Where's that coming from? I wouldn't fuck now if my life depended on it!
Wrong. I've driven a hundred and twenty miles, told a hundred and twenty lies, and said a hundred and twenty Hail Mary's since I saw you. Hungry?
He's dead. He's dead. The Fella Killed Old Shoe.
Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you.
I haven't been using it recently LESLIE
I know you don't want help.
I've got plenty of friends.
-- What kind of childhood did you have?
Come again?
Drew is none of your damn business. Nor is where I put my mouth.
No, Joe, I'm swimming here. Then I'm going home.
Yes. I didn't confess today.
Exactly. And he got good.
Coward!
Well...I admit it. I'm glad to hear that.
What?!!
Oh, no! Not Sophie! No way! Please don't tell me that!!
You're goddamn right I am!
At school. It's Thursday.
Sarah. Eddie, look. I've got troubles, and I think maybe you've got troubles. Maybe it'd be better if we just leave each other alone.
I'm not sure... I don't know.
I got it all ready. Here.
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.
I can't, no, no, I can't...
Like you helped her, Jake?
Becky heard this woman on the radio complaining about this guy she was sure was Rick, which meant he was cheating on her. She was completely hysterical. Then it turned out the woman lived in Duluth.
I know. It makes no sense at all. Thank God my life is in place.
I thought I would look into doing a story about those radio shows.
I don't blame you, Earl. If I were in your place I wouldn't trust anybody, either.
Baseball?
The Colonel saw you shoot Nunez, you're a murderer --
Harold!
You made me look like an idiot --
Please--
You look nice today.
Huh?
I'll do it.
Thank you. I thought you were avoiding me.
In the last six weeks you've only been in my elevator once -- and then you didn't take your hat off.
Last time I saw you was someplace very gay. I remember waving to you. I was dancing on a table.
An "Ootheca". An eggcase. It probably had more, uh "weirdbugs" inside.
Hello, Mr. deMille.
That's no excuse. You read the script, didn't you?
Then you could have picked up the phone yourself instead of leaving it to one of your assistants.
You sure you didn't see one of these?
We can't all get up and leave, can we? I mean, there are certain needs you have to respond to...
It's not that bad.
I mean, you think I'm that happy?
A week or two isn't going to ruin your life, for Godsakes.
Well, do you -- I mean, have you enjoyed all these... strange things you've been doing?
Alright, we'll do that tomorrow.
That remote control thing?
Yes, baby?
Since before they stopped us las' night.
You're the coward.
Charles! Your - your breaking this man's neck - would scarcely explain this note - Serious consequences for Mr. Kane - for myself, and for my son. What does this note mean, Miss -
Rogers, I don't think I will postpone doing something about you until I'm elected. To start with, I'll break your neck.
I can't tell you the things he said, Charlie. You haven't got any idea -
He always has two or three going...
Are you working on a new book?
A night like this, it sort of spooks you to walk into an empty apartment.
That was good. You were holding the evidence.
Yes you are. I'm not just some reporter. I don't just stick a microphone in your face. You could give me something.
You're not so bad yourself.
Well, who was it that taught me how to do that? Huh?
Look at this. You have blood on your shirt. Whose is it?
Small world.
She is but an arriviste.
She is only the Princess of Cool. Mommy is the Queen!
And...?
He wouldn't know. I saw her in the shower!
I'll be right back with Mrs. Wheeler.
Because I have something very important to do.
Children, I want you to be very good and very quiet while I see Mrs. Wheeler a moment. She's going to take over this class for a while.
Where will the money go?
Can we look at one?
Yeah.
What have you done with him?
It is my job. I did it when he was happy and it was easy. It is only fair I do it now when he is ill. Enough talk. I must wake up the master.
You went out with her?
What do I do?
I blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. I only hope you did not get him excited. It could give him a new stroke.
Help yourself. Oh, Tom, show this gentleman...
How many girlfriends did you have?
Well... 1... 2... 10... 100... 1000? How many, approximately?
Why? Did you have too many and you fear it may shock me? I won't get shocked. I'm used to this! My father was a true pig. He fucked the bitch I'd as mother all around the apartment. Whenever a door was closed, you could be sure they were making sex behind it! And my sister, if you didn't sleep with her, you're building's exception!
Then? You didn't give a shit about her father, didn't you? You met anyway?
First let the poor thing have something to eat.
Uh. Yes. Twice they weren't. Two times they didn't.
Umm. Three I believe. But I'm not sure.
Yes.
One.
Yeah, sure, I guess...
Everybody's too stupid!
I didn't get it either.
Yeah, it took a while before I got a chance to play it, but when I heard that song it was like --
Wow!
Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
Did I hear the word...
Well, they needed immediate answers, Frances. It's good manners and good sense. You shouldn't be bothering yourself with these right now.
You'll be gone, period.
Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
You like it?
What are we going to do?
What are we gonna do about it...?
No one's waiting.
Home.
He's a very sweet man.
Do you think he can do it?
If I'm sleeping with him, and I haven't said I am, then so what?
You're hurting my arm.
All I did...
What did I do?
I hate the crayon Burnt Sienna and people who spit when they walk.
Someone with whom you don't have quite so personal a--
He doesn't work that way.
You're not.
I wouldn't let you. Good luck with DePinto.
Eat your fish.
Oops! I dropped it!
You'd go so far as to mutilate a helpless girl who has no means to defend herself, you'd go that far? Don't you think I know what you've just said and don't you think I understand the dreadful and revolting crime you've just conspired to commit?
Who are all these people?
Meet me at the Starlight Motel on Sycamore... I'll be there in twenty minutes.
Where downstairs?
You're very funny --
Free --
Tomorrow? What time tomorrow?
Of course.
There. All done. Lift me down.
Ah! Pleased to meet you.
Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it.
It's kind of falling apart.
Yes, Madam. And now Madam will sleep. It is not long 'till the train.
In the middle of the night -- those flowers make me think of a funeral. Laurels and tube-roses. Oh, think, Suzette -- the Villa and the sun at Tremezzo -- quiet -- simple -- happy -- we'll have a guest, Suzette.
When a lady falls in love she does her hair differently.
I've done my hair differently -- do you like that?
Goodnight, Suzette.
I thought it wasn't for sale.
Outside it's--it's such a mess--it's--
They got people to fight. Arabs, yellow people, whatever. Might as well use us.
No, sir. Not at all.
No, sir. They all been real straight with me.
Well, the line of the jacket -- No really....just very nice...just right. I wish I could be there.
I'm in the bathroom.
Could you bring it up?
I really don't want to put this on again. Won't you bring it up?
On that chair in the hall.
You can always get another girl.
Well...sure.
You've talked to Billy?
I was just thinking that war is a series of goodbyes. Do you think that's why we're meeting. To help us say goodbye to Rafe?
They're very nice. Let me get my coat.
So have you always lived in L.A.?
Sounds like you lived in Grovers Corners.
Did you find it boring?
Oh. I loved those shows! "Inner Sanctum"... "The Shadow" --
You're not gonna believe the first picture I ever saw. Your friend's.
And Billy told you that he'll tell that to...
You do what you want. You want to leave...You want to go kill yourself?
I don't need a shrink.
Okay, stop being so dramatic.
Uh-huh.
Please don't. Not tonight. I'm not up for it. They always stay till mornin'. I'm just give out, Doyle.
C mon, Jack, you think there aren t mornings when I wake up and wonder what the hell I m doing in New Jersey...
My office is a dump, I answer my own phone...and you ve seen my pay check.
Please Doyle, don't.
I mean yes, I help people that need it...
Norman...
I stand for something. And I'm trying to communicate something.
And you've got wiener breath.
Why?
I'll stay.
I mean...with your car.
So what's wrong?
Rose.
I guess you have.
Well Enrique is great and...we are the best.
You strike me as a man with a defined notion of injustice -- a high concern for the lot of your fellow men. And yet you're able to remain an outsider. With the concomitant air of ... superiority?
You'd know, of course.
Not really.
Uh-huh.
I couldn't wait till I got home last night and wash my hair.
I got a few. But I can't afford to start all over again. I got too much time and money invested in my records.
I'm not sure yet. I've had a shock recently, and I'm only beginning to get over it. Perhaps I'll go back to the convent one day.
She looks a little old for you. About thirty-five, forty years old?
Do they worry you that much, then?
I know perfectly well how little I can do. What I want to do is give passing beggars a roof, some food, and a bit of human warmth.
Leave him alone.
She's more than twenty-nine years old, Marty. That's what she tells you.
You're a darling.
They're awful. They make me cough.
You don't know how glad I am to see youl
Come on. You're seriously trying to tell me the Japs can't find Los Angeles without my headlights?
In my eyes, officer.
It's not your fault. Mike, please get off the case.
Did you hear what I said?
What?
Mike, take it easy...
What?
Where are we? You know where we are. It's called the beach. It's where life first crawled up out of the sea. I come here sometimes... when I feel like crawling back in.
Do what, show you a good time?
I don't think so, but if that's what you want...
What do you want?
Yes, that's right. I'm being terribly rude. Bob? Oh, Bob. This is Bob Tuckett. Bon was at Oxford too.
Was that your chapter, then? It was very good.
No, it's all right. I can get a cab. Night night.
You leave your father to me.
Then why does she act so dumb?
She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb.
Hold on --
Can it be that easy?
Any of you get ahead of me -- walk this far up?
Somewhere else?
Do you live alone? I've been in these clothes since...the killings. Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody?
Are you married?
I will if they don't send me back.
Give the little girl to me. Come here, sweetheart. Are you ready?
Good, then let's go!
-- Viktor, that was Short Subject.
I took a loan on my car and my computer.
He'll do it. You really-should have talked to him first.
Hm-mm. Oh, yeah. I met Phil.
So... are you alone, or are you just using me to make someone else jealous?
Yes, that would be great. Are you her for the convention?
And what is your policy? That if you're not getting any, no one can?
What's with the plastic picnic ware? Why not try ours... afraid it isn't clean?
Okay.
Intra office. And they're not dating. They're having sex.
Oh, man! Who told?
Here, here, here, now! Don't you go back to work on me, too. I'm getting tired of this. Besides, it's beginning to affect your looks
Liar! You're just suffering from lack of sleep.
For a celebrated bounder, that is an awful admission. Besides, I never knew that any female could do this to you .
Me?
What is the matter with you? You're trembling?
Oh, listen...
I know. It's terrible!
May I ask you a personal question?
What do you do, with the money you earn?
Yes.
Maybe it's the time to do something, isn't it?
At the end, he made me change my mind about a lot of things.
Yeah, I did. He was my most memorable patient.
My God you look exactly like him.
What?
What's the big deal?
How do you know?
All right, I'm not ashamed of it! I split it two ways
...are you waiting for a bus?
Hi... what's your name?
As always.
Waiting for the bus that never comes...
Oh, so this is a tall tale?
Owe you what?
Don't do that again!
What?!
Good? Good, Paulie?! I've been treatin' you like a baby. Since I can't remember it's so long -- I'm the only one who feeds you an' puts you in bed when ya can't stand up -- and it's you that made me feel like a loser -- That's what ya use to call me 'Loser' -- What kind of name is that? So can ya blame me for not remembering to talk about you when I'm with Rocky -- I don't owe you, Paulie, you owe me.
They fired you?
I can't. I need my family around me now.
Fine, Dennis. Soon as I get my money for this week.
I'll help you. To begin with, you'd like to know what I'm doing here. Whether I was born here.
That's why I can tell you, straight out, you think too much about Irena -- blame yourself for her death. And its your thinking and brooding about her that makes you so unnaturally concerned about Amy.
Yes.
As a matter of fact, all I saw was a little boy whistling in the dark.
Oh, I know. It was full of this and full of that. But you were accomplishing nothing. You were going nowhere, and you knew it.
I really only brought you here to show you my pigeons!
You saved my life. You could have run, but you didn't. You saved me.
Dad?
No.
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, Mr. Jimmy. An interview. After so many years. Very exciting.
Mr. Kay, sir.
Wanna call me a slut now, something?
He's not my boyfriend.
What do you want? Why are you here?
...what the fuck is this...?
What the fuck do you want?
Okay...
He didn't wear bifocals.
But at the playhouse. Nurse?
Fine!
Sure it's true. I was fighting for my country as well as myself.
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
What if he did?
Don't you think he trusts us together?
I don't see why. I'm twice as old as you are. How could anyone think --
Benjamin -- I'm not trying to seduce you. I wish you'd --
Oh, Dad, you're not old. You'll never be old.
It's not modesty. I just don't try to kid myself.
Please do.
I consider myself lucky they didn't throw things.
You're more than kind. But it's still Miss Channing's performance. I'm just a carbon copy you read when you can't find the original...
I don't think I've done anything to sound off about.
I heard you tonight.
Then why do I have to go to bed?
I'm not tired!
Yeah, sure.
Why not?
What are you doing tonight?
Yes, Mikey?
Let's get you darker!
I like my name.
The boss is watching us...
This is Danny and Ralph, they own the Dino Raphael salon in Detroit. We used to be married.
And you expect me to come over, just like that.
And dost thou live to ask it?
I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't mean...
Two months ago, you thought you had a malignant melanoma.
The guy died.
Are you sure it can't hurt us?
Aren't you?
I won't be a minute.
Well - if I'm not in the way...
Imagine. All this admiration in just one room.
She, too, is a great admirer of yours.
You're not going, are you?
No, don't go...
I think I'd better. It's been - well, I can hardly find the words to say how it's been...
Stick around. Please. Tell you what - we'll put Stanislavsky on his plane, you and I, then go somewhere and talk.
The four of you must have so much to say to each other - with Mr. Sampson leaving...
All right! Then call! At least, call!
God, look at this poster! I can't believe this room! You're the luckiest guy in the world! I'd kill to have stuff like this!
I'm talking to you... I'll bet there are tons of women who would go out with you in a minute!
...EGGzactly. I'm putting on my coat -- We are late. We are seriously late. Which means Mister Ben we've got to get you dressed --
He was there with someone. So I suppose she must have dragged him -- that's not fair. I'm going back to Mongi. I think Dickie's coming home. I'm going to go home.
I hope so.
That's Daddy!
Yeeaahhh... Ohmigod ... ohmigod... ohmigod...
You just wouldn't. It's not the Amish way. But I think it would have done me good if I could have screamed at your brother last night.
Oh no. You ll have to do better than that, Mr Lombard.
How dare you... You don t know this tape belongs to my brother, do you, Mr Lombard?
No. The question now is how long it s going to take you to get out of here, Mr Lombard.
What, you were going to come over the next day all calm and say, Kelly that really made me mad? Don't tell me you're mad. Be mad. Be who you are right now.
Get back? From where?
Don't even start.
I burned the Christmas tree.
Why didn't you come over, get mad at me, tell me what a stupid bitch I was.
You've got to do something special. You've got to make a statement.
Mmm. It says something about the two of you maybe.
We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages.
Lava's hateable. I never thought of that.
... Maybe one day you shall find yourself in a similar position, Chauncey... Maybe one day...
Yes, when I was younger I had thoughts about public office... But I found, Chauncey - that I was able to contribute more as a private citizen... of course, my wealth provided me with considerable influence, but I've tried, believe me, not to misuse that power... It's extremely important, Chauncey, when one is in a position of eminence, that he does not allow himself to become blinded to the needs of the country... The temptations are strong, and I've been labeled a 'kingmaker' by many, but I have tried to stay open to voices of the people... I have tried to remain honest to myself...
Sorry, didn't mean to --
I was so worried I wouldn't compare with Hannah.
I know it isn't.
Why's that?
Oh, all the time.
Thank you. I love you.
So maybe you'll come too?
Good-night dad.
You're staring at me.
I've been thinking, Ben, about Wendy. I was going to ask if she'd come with me sometime to meet Dr. Woolens.
I did, but -- somebody should probably see her, talk to her... You think she's ok?
Yes. It won't be long now. Seventeen days.
How are you, Travis? I read about you in the papers.
Thank you, Travis.
But then you'll forget about me.
Did you find out where she was?
What happened?
I can't tell you that.
What?
By myself?
What is this?
Ben, I don't think he wants us here.
Huh?
Well, then forget all this stern dad stuff.
And I just want to know if I'm crazy or not -- if what I think is happening is actually happening. Or am I one of those people, those women, who are blind to what's going on? Who pretend not to see their husband's attention toward another woman?
Thea, your choice is a very simple one. Either you want to claim him as your father, or you do not.
Early, sing me a song.
Up yours.
Who?
Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose.
Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
What?
You're a police officer. You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon. That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
Especially Tiger Woods. ...Actually, he keeps his on the back seat.
That was so great what you just said.
Don't mention it--
Thanks a lot.
Do you want to dictate them?
You keep the ten thousand pounds.
These people will pay you ten thousand before and ten thousand after. They want someone they can be sure of, an honest dealer. That's the point. Not all dealers are honest. Mr Reynolds will never suspect you.
Ask them to sit down, Mr. Bernstein.
We certainly do. Vacation's over - starting right after dinner. But right now - that lady over there - - that's the new society editor, I take it? You think I could interrupt her a moment, Mr. Bernstein?
Who?
Why don't you buy it, only forty bucks.
We got em. North...No, Henry James was the novelist, Frank James was a criminal... Yep, you came to the right place. Jessie James was the Brother. Of the novelist, that's right. That's alright Susie. See you tomorrow, Susie.
I'm afraid. I'm afraid if Paulie finds out.
Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
Why do you think that?
Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
Look, someone gave her the baby.
She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
Why haven't you asked her?
Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
And you didn't try to find out who?
Bye.
Nobody knew me before tonight.
Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something?
Even Paulie, since he got out, I hardly see him.
Okay.
He told me to take the kids to the police station and make the cops put me on welfare.
Let's go home. Okay?
I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure. I just... I need you, Rob. That's it. And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...
Ray's a disaster. I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.
Good. Songs. What songs should Sidney -- Pancho and his six men we can forget about -- what songs do you think he should play?
Want to know what, exactly?
Betty.
...free-lance. You know.
Well... well, the clich about the security of it, that's really true. We own a house, and I really like that, you know? And I like that John was just made junior partner, so he has a steady job and he's not some...
Oh, uh-huh.
Oh, definitely. I mean, just this past year has gone by like phew! I hardly even knew it passed.
You mean like "time flies"?
Something else I want to try.
I'm going to go out for a while. I want to take the blood samples to a lab that has the equipment I need.
Shush!...Time for bed anyway... Likely these'll need some takin' in...Oh, Martie, you're that gaunted! ...Ma's havin' a turkey for dinner tomorrow and...
I was hoping you were over that. Remember to keep drinking fluids.
I think it would be better for me to go alone. I'm sure Sim is looking for you. Just sit tight. I'll bring you back a pizza.
I don't have a clue anymore. I wish you'd talk to him. He needs a man.
A man he respects.
I know he does.
What do you mean?
I started seeing things.
It got so bad your father almost had to put me away.
There they are!
...I don't know.
I've got to get back for the evening shift, so make yourself at home, watch T.V., whatever. Just grab a blanket and pillow off the bed. I never need them all anyway.
No, dear. Margo must go on. As a matter of fact, I see no reason why you shouldn't be Margo's understudy...
How did they explain what you remembered? The gun and stuff?
What do you think?
Scottie, Scottie...
All the old men I know think about nothing but sex.
I've paid the rent, the Con-Ed and the phone bill, so you don't have to worry about them.
I thought it would be good to know.
And go to confession.
Car and a driver, Mr. Brean, the Westgate, Now, please...
I have to work on my video project! Don't follow me! I can put myself to bed.
I can't seem to let go of you...
Comfort.
Hey, we can become blood brothers.
Where're you going to go?
Have I been a good wife?
I'll be out... Just leave me. I'll be out. I'm fine. Really. I'm fine.
What, Mason?
That's right.
Don't you usually like to sit at the back? To wave at your Dad?
Because...he wanted to them to be punished.
I want you to stop seeing her.
You know, where I-I-I would get implanted from a-a donor.
It was all over the local news. Dwayne was there, acting all official.
An how many years does it take a person to make his family safe and secure and happy, and then in one dumb moment, what does he do?
But Silvia I did not care for much. His fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. Stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! Oh, when can we see another?
You shit! I'll decide if I go or not. Not you. I don't know what you do on your planet, but I didn't think that was very nice walking out on me like you did.
Please understand. If you go this way, you'll never get to your ship. The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. I'll get you to your ship. I promise.
Come on.
Yes, I have !
Exactly.
He holds that key so tight, he's probably got it stuck up his ass.
Yeah. 'Cause, you know, He's never gonna give me my jewelry.
I didn't. I didn't. I mean, I did, but then I did exactly what you told me to do, and I came right back.
Early, you are so sweet.
Good night??!
Okay, great, Grunick -- Easy shots now -- huh? Good night.
Uh-huh.
I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes.
Yeah, I think I've heard of that. What goes around comes around.
There was supposed to be a turn off. Did I miss it?
What would they say? "Ten miles to big rock." "Twenty miles to bigger rock."
Is this you?
He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for 1000 the day before he disappeared.
Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
Norville, there really is something I have to tell you --
Golly. Who's paying for this?
I made it up just now, and who's asking you? I know it's silly, honey, but do it for me, won't you?... Yes, right now.
I want to interview Earl Williams, Warden. How about a little service?
Don't get up. And don't act as if I were the queen mother.
Can't we sit down? Just for a minute...
I've got nothing else to do on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Oh, some years ago I heard my mother talking about it. But is it true?
The name should be Eddie. What should my name be?
It's over, Elliot. I don't know how to make it any clearer. It's over. I can't see you anymore.
Yeah, we're having some problems, but problems that are my business...which I don't see how you could know about in such detail. How does Lee know about these things? How? They're private!
No, he hasn't. If I offended you, I'm sorry.
I don't see how you could know about these things unless Elliot's been talking to you.
That's the point. I'd like to be bothered.
It'll bleed.
I'm concerned about her health.
Who was that person Mother? Was it you?
If you believe this is murder, it is the Crown attorney you have to talk to, not me. And definitely not Agnes.
All I want is one more week.
Who? That tun... that tunnel hasn't been used in fifty years.
Oh, would you stop lying Mother!
Why would I lie?
Because it's murder we're talking about. Aren't you concerned about what she told us about the other person in her room.
Yes, that's because I'm getting to her.
I was acting as a Private Citizen. Nothing that I've done should be construed as reflecting on the orders or intentions of anyone with whom you may have reason to believe I am connected with. Or in whose employ...
What is?
"Father of the Bride."
I went to the movies.
I got bored so I went to the movies.
I took the kids to my sister's.
I'd love to tell her myself. When are you going to let me meet her?
Yes. To be honest I never quite saw this film before -- maybe it's the way Simone is playing it -- but what it's saying about the illusion of permanence in everyday life, how that's the only way we can love -- I think it's really going to mean something.
I should fire you more often. The film's looking wonderful.
Maybe you're right. Twelve years after your daughter's born you decide to become a father.
Gross.
Did you notice all those weird things on the menu? Like "The Salad Explosion"?
I know... and instead of "dessert" it says "Mindbenders."
What does that even mean?
Check out the Personals... maybe our future husbands are trying to contact us.
God, this paper is so boring. Who reads all this shit? Here we go... "Windsurfing Doctor, Mensan IQ, maverick Sagittarius. Let's hit the clubs, make each other laugh!"
You can have that one.
Okay, well here's yours... "Who said all the most eligible bachelors are taken? Not this one! Stunning bod, very snugglelicious ocean sunset dreamer."
I know.
Uh huh.
It's not that. Can we meet after school? Please?
I think she looks nice! Her lips are very thin so I used the gloss to give them a more sensual quality, and her eyes just needed a little definition, and her hair, I'm sorry, nobody wears this hairdo anymore in 1972.
Where's he going?
Pigeons... .
Go ahead, wear it.
I know... I know... .
Sorry.
Look, now I'm pumping you. I'm sorry. It's none of my business. It's just that you're not like the others.
Now he's a real shit. Don't get friendly with him. I'm sure he's got his hand in the till. You know what he said to me once? "I want to fuck the whole world over. That's my mission." The shit!
Hey.
My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully cute.
There must be some proof that exists right now! Something that proves he got that money away from Mary... Some way!
What have you got to do with it?
What do you mean by that?
Belong - to you? That sound medieval - something out of an old melodrama...
I can't believe my ears...
... taken it for granted? That you and I...
Dad'll pick you up today, all right?
Okay.
Good night.
For the last time, put them on the table.
Put them on the table.
-- All right. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now I want those letters. Get them for me.
Gage's gone!
What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!
How'd you like a punch in the nose?
That's what he's been doing since last heard from.
No. This is going to be our last session.
This isn't a joke. Your parents spend a lot of money to send you here. I'm trying to help you.
Don't you want to change that?
I think that's all the time we have for today.
You think you can come in here with that cute little smirk on your face and try and flirt with me. It doesn't work, Sebastian.
You go set down by the River.
I called your agent. I called the Screen Writers Guild. Finally your old apartment gave me some Crestview number. There was always somebody with an accent growling at me. You were not there. You were not to be spoken to. They never heard of you.
Not now, Charlie. I've got a headache. Get used to the word. Roll it around your tongue for a years.
No? Huh? Yes, of course!!
When are you going to open your eyes?
I think that's for the best.
Where will you be?
No. Mister Harding, that is not true.
Have I told you how proud I am of you -- ?
That's okay, Daddy.
Most men are.
Thank you very much.
You're surprised!... But I guess I just never met the right guy. Whatta gonna do?
I mean, I've gone out with bums, but they were gorgeous. It's the only reason to go out with a bum.
Jack, he's starting a conversation...
I'm sorry.
You made it pretty damn clear you thought he was nobody.
I felt that you could do better for yourself--
What? Become a nun? You didn't want me going out with Anglos--
I never said that. It was just that boy--
"That boy"--Mami, say his name for chrissakes!
No, just leave it. He knows I must be at home. I'm working nights this week.
Get out of town, Bobby, as quick as you can.
Nothing.
It's Stuart... he's in Mexico City...
That you'd die on the way to the hospital. Now get into that tub.
He's coming right over.
Goddamn it. Get in here. I can't stand around waiting.
That's your decision.
You're red hot, damn it. Get in there. I've got to get more ice.
What... do you remember?
I see...
Did he sound upset?
How many times in your life do you get a speech like that?
Wilson.
Your calendar, your cell phone, your whoo pig sooey hat, some pictures of that ketch you wanted.
What's that, written on the sail?
Yeah, coffin, headstone, the whole thing.
Let me go. Children get off.
It's an improvement.
I guess it ain't modern times in Sicily. He came right from the airport. He wanted to talk to you. You got a love bite on your neck. He's coming back this morning.
It was a miracle.
A miracle? This is modern times! There ain't supposed to be miracles any more!
No cops. I've got a warrant out. Mail fraud. They'll take me in, but you won't be able to prove anything else.
Great...
Where are we going ?
Good theory, Ted.
This is cute.
There were a group of them--I think five, I don't know their names.
The world can wait, Jon. You're going.
I can't be positive that it was used for the break-in but people sure are worried.
The ones who could disburse the money.
There are too many people watching me--they know I know a lot--
A lot of it was. I just thought it was sort of an all-purpose political fund--you know, for taking fat cats to dinner, things like that.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
Hi. Nice to see you.
Max...
Max? Oh... ...it's kind of a strange time to be calling...
Yes.
Yes.
I have thought about it, yes.
I don't see what difference it makes, I mean, I can think what I want. I don't know if I want to do this anymore, I'm afraid... I don't mind answering the questions so much, but if somebody were to see this...
Like?
Sometimes, yeah. You know, I started to do performances.
Yeah?
So? What's L.A. like?
No, Sandro... We should go. Besides, we haven't been in touch with anybody. Not even with Anna's father. We should have at least sent a wire or telephoned... let's be fair, he must be feeling awfully lonely.
Oh, Sandro... I want everything you do. But...
Did the hotel manager speak to you about that place nearby?
Sandro, wait a moment, just one moment... You seem like an entirely different person ...
What are you saying?
Fine. Wait.
Oh... We split up.
I told you it's impossible for me to have a baby.
Then I sit back and I think, I mean, who's to say I'm not a dumb bitch. I work in a bar, right? I can't read a list of my academic credentials to every booze-hound that comes in the place... You are what you do...
Aren't you the one that thinks all psychotherapy is bullshit?
If this is your idea of sympathetic interest in my problems, I'll take brutal indifference.
Tell me--I'm dyin' to hear it.
How many?
What, five?
Not a chance.
Bullshit.
Your house must have been a zoo.
No one can take my father's place.
Girl, lemme ask you somethin' and I want you t'tell me straight up, since I got my suspicions and y'know I ain't one t'talk circles... you gay?
You have some very primitive ideas, don't you?
I am not!
Yes.
This is not any fucking medication talking, this isn't -- I don't know. I don't know -- Can you give me nothing? You have power of attorney, can you see him, can you, in this final fucking moment, go see him and make sure --- change the fucking will -- I don't want any money, I couldn't live with myself, this thing I've done -- I've fucking done so many bad things -- I fucked around. I fucked around on him, I fucking cheated on him, Alan. You're his lawyer, our laywer, THERE, I'm his wife, we are married. I broke the conract of marriage, I fucking cheated on him, many times over, I sucked other men's cocks and fuck - fuck - fuck - ....fuck.... Other Things I've Done..
You know I burned all his shit. All that vinyl. Chalamar, Funkadelic, I burned his turntables too. They was like three-thousand brand new.
I've been to Information Adjustments. They sent me here. They told me you had a form I had to fill in.
Nothing.
Nah.
Your brother's always looked after you, hasn't he?
Is that your kind of reading, Steve?
How did you land that?
I want to hear it.
What job?
You're my prisoner.
Oh My God.
It's terrible, no.
What do you do with all this pudding?
No. I'm the exact opposite --
Six months, maybe five, five or six months...do you wanna check that?
But, Jake, I was just...
I was just...
The junior pathologist at Ashford Hospital. Then the husband of a colleague of mine, then a trainee radiologist, then the service manager at my garage.
Why me?
I've told you ten times--if I had anything they couldn't bat down in a second, don't you suppose I'd've been up in that hearing yelling murder! Sure--he was cooked the night I sounded off like a fool and spilled the whole works!
On Norville Barnes!
I'm not taking him with me.
This rig? Phht. No problem.
No, I won't.
I want him. I want him so much. I'll kill myself if I can't have him.
And where do you think you're going?
You go to bed this minute and take off that lipstick.
Out.
There, there, my baby.
There, like that. Kind of, uh, sexy. You can support me anytime, John.
I just remembered. You were talking about bodybuilding and swearing.
Now you help me up. Boy, you seem... taller. It must be psychological... now that I know you saved my life...
The bag with the envelopes.
My bag. My bag.
Evan, stop! You're gonna kill him!
...I spoke to your new lawyer about the appeal. He's sure he can get you off on self-defense, so if you're patient.
He has thousands of employees, Milo --
What?
I don't know. Why don't you ask him?
Milo --
Give me all your money, bitch!
When I said before that I hoped it wasn't the end of the evening, I was, you know... talking about breakfast and stuff.
I'd like it if you could stay the night.
Good. In that case, I'll fix us something else to drink. You sticking to the whiskey or you want coffee?
Tops off two whiskeys and starts into the other room where she sees Rob, standing and holding his jacket.
Jesus, so much for delicacy. I pegged you for a master of understatement, beating around the bush and all that buzz.
No. The Pill will change all that. Then he wouldn't have blamed me. We were just too young.
Sometimes things are simpler than you think. Let me ask you a question.
Always has been.
Well, you look... sad. Upset. I don't mean to pry. I'm sorry about your mother. It was a nice funeral.
Who?
Who?
I can't feel my body.
Thank God. Oh thank God. Tommy, you didn't bust out, didya? You ain't got to hide, have you?
I think -- you're trying to get me drunk.
I'm tellin' ya, this guy's just the patsy and I'm gonna find out what for. There's a real story, Smitty, some kind of plot, a setup, a cabal, a -- oh, and say, did I tell ya?!
-- I've got to study.
Well, I'd like to be lady-like and think it over.
What would you do if it was a daughter?
What!
Do you want to?
Lester, this is my friend Jill and this is Johnny Pope.
Do you have a better idea?
Ah..... they're very tiny... they look like a fingernail made out of an erector set...
It brings out my eyes...
Don't worry, I'm leaving.
You're such a nutcase, I can't even begin to keep up.
...It is just hard for me to understand why anybody wants to be a fighter.
I don't think you're a bum.
Yes.
Why do you do it if it hurts so bad?
'Cause you can't sing or dance?
Too bad.
He does not exaggerate. I was good.
Glory Hallelujah.
Oh, now--
She's going through a really rough time right now.
Uh, losers! All losers!
You're too demanding.
Hmm!
I'm-I'm always happy to help you financially. I think I've gone out of my way to-to introduce you to interesting single men. There's nothing I would--
Hey, Hannah, I know I'm mediocre.
Oh, will you stop attacking Hannah?!
You know, I could always tell what you thought of me by the type of men you fixed me up with!
You're crazy! That's not true.
I have to get to the airport...
You ever wonder why you get beat up a lot?
So that gives you something.
Don't crank the gain any more. You're gonna fry yourself.
No! I can still defeat Bavmorda!
Does everybody have to hear?
Jack, I was just trying to help.
May I sit down?
Please don't shout.
I'm not going.
Are you a writer too?
Good for you.
So how's that book of yours going, Miles? I think you were almost done with it last time we talked.
Sure.
'Night.
What?
Seven jaguars' skins, I'm told. Harold shot every one. Shall we go?
Gentlemen! Is this right for a fight? It's been so long.
Wake up. Stop playing with yourself. It's finished.
It's over, Jake. It's all over.
Sit down.
Sit down, Jake.
Yes. But you're going to sit down right now. I have to...
Your capacity for self-delusion is remarkable, Dr. Singer.
Oh, not for the world!
If they find you here they will kill you.
Well, I don't have any money . . .
Hey Yeah?
Yep.
All his life. He's tried everything.
Then why are you here?
Take me to that motel. Like you wanted.
Peter, your blood-type is AB negative. There's no way your birth father can be O positive. You father is not who you think he is.
Well, what Marty you think is gonna be here in this house with a girl?
Your son Marty?
Marty.
Who?
Hey, I come home from your house last night, Marty was here with a girl.
The only baptism he ever performed in seven years as pastor at Bedford.
Tomorrow night, whisper a new tale to your neighbor, Cleante. He'll whisper it to his neighbor Dauphin, who'll whisper it to his neighbor Franval --
-- whose cell lies next to the linen cabinet! There, armed with a quill of my own, I'll commit it to paper!
But --
Let's...hold up for a bit. It may not happen. Our secret, okay?
Uh. Have you told Luke and the ki...
...make some trips into the city. Sometimes, overnight.
They don't believe me.
You're sure you want to? In the universe I saw we're not exactly the stars of the show. What happened to me makes us all seem pretty damn small.
I don't have any proof, Palmer.
It's not enough, don't you understand? I know it happened -- but by every standard of science, by every standard I've lived my life by that fact is utterly beside the point. It may be true but it doesn't matter because I can't prove it's real.
Don't worry. He's out of town.
People said she looked like me.
You see how much we have to say.
I should be going.
Sure.
My brushes, I have to clean my brushes. Thanks, though.
I forgave you the moment you said it.
God, wake up, it's a con!
Every guy has a type!
Okay, what about this one? Are you into girls with big tits?
C'mon Seymour, I'm trying to collect data here! Don't you want me to find you your perfect dream girl?
We need to narrow this down somehow... we need to find a place where you can meet women who share your interests.
I'll get it.
Okay, what would you have done.
But ef you do whup me, I swear you better not ever go to sleep again, because the minute you go to sleep, or you're settin' down, or your back's turned, I'm gonna knock you belly-up with a bucket.
I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
Any news?
You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. "-- any time -- any place -- anywhere!"
Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks -- then Bermuda... Oh, about four months, I guess. Seems like yesterday to me.
No -- Mama doesn't dream about you any more, Walter. You wouldn't know the old girl now.
How long is what?
No.
Mutants?!
Did something happen; are you alright?
What did he want?
What happened?
Ok.
Yes... lots of things!
Dad, I'm so sorry. I know this is a bad time.
I was irresponsible, I should have called.
No thanks.
Weightless almost -- as if I were seeing my own memories of being a girl. There was something internal about it.
Hi mom.
Hi Wendy.
I saw you on your bike today.
With Mikey?
Who?
Nobody.
Mikey Williams?
We were just riding around.
I know you do, Sidney.
Then what?
He was always so "nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that. Was it ever?
Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
Brad. Please don't tell Mom and Dad...
Have him committed.
I'm coming with you.
Yes . . .
I know what to do about mother.
My sister, for one. Is that who it is?
It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement. Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild.
You ever think about dying?
I preffer to stand.
You're not going after Argon!
Do the words 'hero fantasies' mean anything to you? How about 'infantile dementia'?
It's not fun for me anymore because you're missing.
I admit it - I was scared! I was shocked, in fact , by what he said. And he's so...convincing. I'm sorry if I let you down, but really, I still say he's just one opinion. I don't even like his books that much. They're all so aggressively confrontational. I don't care if he's won the Pulitzer Prize.
It's her. This is the woman who I've seen.
Not ever.
That was nice of Mr. Galbraith.
They lied.
What?
What was what?
What's with you?
Actually, he sounded nice.
Oh? Oh, really? Now we're getting down to it.
You're inconsiderate and absolutely devoid of emotion!
He'll still be your son-in-law!
Maddy, what did you do to your hair?
So I guess we're both fucked, huh? But at least you get to go to heaven. I don't get shit.
I'm fine.
Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty...
Ohh!
Not everything. Even on earth. Take ... yeasts.
Is it snowing?
It's something.
Marcus...You'll write something better next time!
He told me... get help. I just stood there and watched him... I watched him die, Laz. Oh God! GODDAMMIT!
You didn't have to beat him up!
What happened, darling. We were so worried. I was going to take a sleeping pill, but I wouldn't till I knew you were home.
But Charlene...
Oh, Laz... he hurt me. He... hurt me so many times.
Yes.
You know what, Ace? I don't give a shit! I'm gettin' out of here. I am.
Huh?
Look, if you two are in this thing together, I don't care, it's none of my business... But I want to see Mary. I want her to tell me she's all right and it's none of my business. Then I'll go back to Phoenix and...
Didn't know you was workin' here now?
Yeah.
I think maybe over a hundred.
Can I come home with you when we get there?
How?
What!
I know you did, Reverend. Oh, I know how you tried!
He's trying.
I don't want to go to the dentist.
I'm just as human as you. I see, I hear, I touch, and I feel just like you do.
Ohhh-hh, ohhh...
This is our first "date" date.
Just a moment! You are not going to fire this girl for an innocent thing like having boy friends, not while there is breath in my body!
First organized fire department was on the border of Dalmatia and Sardinia in the year 642.
Who are you! Who are you!
What do you want!
How would you like to have a couple of little murderers for your children? It'd be fun, wouldn't it? Maybe they'd murder each other... keep it all in the family. That's what Father should have done. He should have killed me and Gilbert... then we wouldn't have had this to go through.
Why not? I am crazy....the whole family's crazy.
As are we all, and I'd like to take this opportunity to suggest that the Security of the country would be ill- served by any, any...any...
What's the profile?
I love you so much, Leon.
What does Snow think you should do?
... including me. Right?
You mean, me?
No.
A beer. Of course.
A beer?
What do you want?
Somebody must be suffering somewhere, you're being so nice.
Where's Ich?
I've heard of Sugai. I've also heard of the emperor. They're both national treasures. One's a hood.
My Japanese isn't that hot... Besides, you'll never get in.
Your completely missing the point.
What have they done to you now?
-- don't you want to --
-- why not? C'mon, take me out of here, somewhere I don't have to lie to anybody and I'll fuck your brains out, you little fiend, I adore you --
Now, this camp is going to be out in your state, of course--
Uh--getting back to this, Senator--
He did?
But you've just taken care of the spirit all right.
No.
Goddamnit Virgil, stop! Don't!
What did you wish for, Adam?
Oh. A nice one, I hope.
Oh, that's just a bunch of baloney! We never believed that in my family!
Of course.
Yes, darling.
Yes, darling.
Fifteen.
Yes.
Wake up, we're in trouble.
No ! Just get up. This is serious.
Drinks. Food. Plus, I called you a cab.
Well... send my love, if you see him again.
God, I don't think so. Better look in the house.
Stacy! I've got water in my ears. Do you have any Q-Tips?
Leave now.
No. Yes, I want to know what for. But I don't want to ask.
If you were going to come back you wouldn't have taken me out tonight. You wouldn't have bought this dress. You're hustling me, Eddie. You've never stopped hustling me.
Why should I?
What do you want me to do? Just sit here and wait? Faithful little Sarah. Pull the shades down and sit. When you feel like coming back, you'll come back. And you'll love me. And then you'll go away again. Is that your idea of love?
I think Daddy suspects.
But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done.
...How violated I feel?
You deserve it.
What are you asking me for? You didn't ask me if I wanted to come in the first place -- now I get to decide? Forget it!
All this for us?
No, but I wanted to. I really wanted to, partially just to piss you off.
For God's sake, Homer, Wally's been shot down!
If you're trying to be funny, Homer...
Stop it! Just cut it out!
No, don't--that's something. Nothing is nothing. Don't even look at me. I want...
Please don't move, don't go anywhere.
Oh God.
How long is this going to go on?
Let them take it!
Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
I don't want your dead body. I don't want you back in jail either.
Watching my son...Ted, I've been living in New York for the past two months.
So, how did your conference go with Gordon?
I never wanted to be a mom. Then, sharing it with you was one thing. Carrying it alone, the rest of my life...
Is scary. But you want it. Gimme some truth here.
I told them.
I do okay.
I don't think so, but it don't really matter. They know I'm meeting you.
That's all right; we all laugh here, but not at you; I'll see to that.
Just trust me, baby -- we'll work it out somehow --
They got it an a long playing record now - Music to String Her Along By. My wife doesn't understand me -- We haven't gotten along for years -- You're the best thing that ever happened to me --
We didn't talk about it -- you did.
We talked about a lot of things.
Do I. That leaky little boat you rented -- and me in a black negligee and a life preserver --
...we had a script conference...
Of course you haven't. I wouldn't let you.
Of course not, Joe. It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain. My nerves are being torn apart. All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind.
Hey--I went to Northwestern! Once. To use the bathroom.
You want to fuck her?
No, Salvatore...there is no future. There's only the past. Even meeting last night was nothing but a dream, a beautiful dream. We never did it when we were kids, remember? Now that it's happened, I don't think there could have been a better ending.
My Thomas is a little rusty.
Not a very happy poem.
Better.
You can't drink.
Harry, I have to go home. I have to talk to Mama.
No, she just didn't want me going to jail, that's all.
You know something, Harry?
Aside from meanness, you're almost perfect. There's only one other thing wrong with you.
For the first time in my life, I wish this car wasn't green.
Are you sure we should be driving like this? In broad daylight and everything?
No we shouldn't, but I want to put some distance between us and the scene of our last Goddamn crime!
Oooooweee!! You shoulda seen me! Like I'd been doin' it all my life! Nobody would ever believe it.
You think you've found your calling?
Maybe. Maybe. The call of the wild!
You're disturbed.
Yes! I believe I am!
You can't tell it from a distance, Ted.
Bullshit! It's about you! About you deciding! About you always being right! You always getting everything your way, controlling everybody -- like we work for you or something!
So you'll come to the wedding, right?
I had a lot of treatments, and they weren't any fun, but the tests show the cancer got smaller.
Oh, God.
I'll lick the stamps.
He looks like a terrific kid.
Crony indeed!
God, Dana's going to kill you!
He's a socialist, then?
What's the matter with you, Seymour? Don't you like me? Be a man for once in your life!
Please. I want you to. It would make me so happy.
Oh Mama, I'm so... tired of that song.
I bet. Thanks for the drink.
Tell me, Claudia, what do you think of Raimondo?
I don't trust anyone. That's what comes of working in television.
It's already started, Dad... with me.
I'm never going back.
Your lips are soft when you kiss.
I don't know, but we can't stay here.
So have I. But I've never been in love. Isn't that awful?
Why did you do that?
Will the police do anything to her?
She'll move away.
What do you want?
Early, what're you doin'?
And I can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more I tried to explain --
She's got two things to do - carry clothes an' press 'em wrong - an' just let anybody else muscle in...
Hello..
Well?
I haven't got a union. I'm slave labor.
Oh-oh.
But the wardrobe women have got one. And next to a tenor, a wardrobe woman is the touchiest thing in show business-
Call, what call?
Could we have you in here, please...7
Jesus Christ, Johnny -- you've been using me! Your jacket's on the floor in the bathroom -- this goddamn thing's half out of the pocket... Oh God, it's all part of some case, isn't it?
Jill's really great, isn't she?
Do me a favor? Eat it, and then give me a secret report, okay? Pay particular attention to whether it's chewy and if it tastes more like chocolate or soup.
Why?
Yeah, uh-huh.
No. But my revelations were for the King of France, not for you.
You go out... with friends?
I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
No. Did you?
Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there.
I don't mean everyone. Just people who can do things because they can arrest people or convict them. Or run a newspaper.
And the way you're looking at me, is that the way you look at a man you've just beaten? As if you'd just taken his money, and now all you want is... his pride?
Put it on the bed. That's the way it's done, isn't it?
In a little while. That's what you want, isn't it?
Kyle, you don't have...
The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
We take the Avedon, right? Simple.
The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
I remember Alger Hiss. I know how ugly you can be -- you're capable of anything. But you see, it doesn't really matter, at the end of the day, what's on them. Because you have absolutely no remorse. No concept of remorse. You want the tapes to get out, you want them to see you at your worst ...
No. They're not yours. They are you. You should burn them.
And what would I find out that I haven't known for years. What makes it so damn sad is that you couldn't confide in any of us. You had to make a record ... for the whole world.
Would you like a tour?
Newberry, get a photo. South?
Yeah, me neither.
North?
Yes. That's true. But...
...what's the Long View?
Tell me, Jody
You didn't?
You'd know I wouldn't run off.
You don't know me, do you?
Not here.
Go ahead, Simon. Your father walked in on you and was yelling and... really, come on.
Hey -- you let him...
Don't you understand? I just have to hold it together -- just until tomorrow --
I can't hear this now --
They sound like finches.
Go and ask him yourself.
Uh-uh.
Mmmm ... thanks, I needed this.
I guessed you were straight black.
Yeah...
No, it's okay. See, when two people belong together, the other person should be the... the key that unlocks the rest of you... I'm not making sense, am I?
I can't see. What are they doing, what's happening?
Yes, he threatened to kill my five year-old son. I was under the impression I would be meeting Juan Obregon.
That one's an elm.
I don't know.
And you're writing Ma all about it. And your pigeons will carry the message of love. And the first thing you know--Susan Paine'll get the best jar of preserves she ever tasted!
I know. Don't tell me. It was a wonderful party. Your suit went over big. And she looked beautiful, and she gave her hand when you left her-- and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." Oh, but it was the way she said it. You like to fell through the floor--Horseradish!
Do you still want me to sit on your lap?
I am. I was just... I just got... I think I got nervous. It's normal, right? Don't you ever feel nervous about, you know?
I do, I have to be attractive to God.
My father's guilty. He lied to me, he lied to everybody. I just left home... I need you.
Everything else means nothing to me. If I hurt you again, I'll die.
I love you.
Yeah.
Yeah. I can wait till you're off the base and do it myself.
I don't want to hurt my daddy.
That bag's almost empty.
Robert, you leave it up these people...!
Laura, how about one friend for the rest of your whole life?
Yes, that's what I want. Thanks D.
Well, usually you have this sort of intense scowl of concentration, like you're doing this for a school project or something... I don't know, like something's driving you. See, it's gone. If I didn't know better I'd say you looked almost happy.
Donna, are you my best friend?
Of course...
What is it Laura? What's wrong?
I just want a friend. Just one friend for just one minute...
Laura?
Well, if you won't let me smoke grass, then at least I'll go get myself some cigarettes.
Tell me everything.
Look at you.
Were you going to make a suggestion?
Why?
I know where you can go. Homer and I can take you...
I can't go nowhere.
She won't go to St. Cloud's!
Don't be silly.
Agent Novak. I didn't get a chance to clear him.
You weren't passing 'em out.
With enough exposure, the same thing they do to everything else.
Three days ago it was.
The replicators start off like assemblers, but the replicators never stabilize.
Worked. Like a charm.
No! Not sweetheart, no. I believe in what's happening. I don't want to, but I do. I guess I was foolish enough to think that would be enough for you.
That man has, perhaps, not yet been born.
Not even that.
Not one.
No.
Never.
I mean, but did you both go camping on weekends? Listen to music? Masturbate together? Talk on the phone?
Are you guys' friends?
IPO's caused the rat population on this street.
It could have been a squirt gun.
You think I'm kidding?
So tell me. Having all that money in your flight bag -- Is it tempting?
You know how easy it would be? He won't be anywhere near that mall. Pull one more switch, up front. That's it. Half-a-million dollars. Need help?
I don't think so, but thanks for the beer.
What happened?
I'm sorry. Well, we need the money. Now we have it.
No.
Don't worry about it. You want anything?
Drive! Drive away!
Now you get a grip, Louise! Just drive us to Goddamn Mexico, will ya!
Oh shit, Thelma!! Shit! Shit! Shit!
Who's them Blue Men yonder?
You, Pearl. You swear too.
Which one?
He hates all my race.
I can't.
He keeps asking for the name of my father and mother.
The General threatened me.
It is more than a feud between two families. He stole my mother away from her people.
Wow! It's brilliant!
Oh really? But can you miss the car?
What if you can't approach the car or he changes car?
What, for example?
How can you say it?
Huh... 500 meters?
Do you know the story of "The Headless Horseman?"
A--flack jacket.
Yah, Menominie only has Chief Perpich and he takes February off to go to Boundary Waters.
It's amazing that your sweet, lovely, gorgeous wife can ever get to see you.
Hello, darling.
Easy. Slow is best.
I invited Marlon and Rita for a barbeque Sunday. I thought I'd make my potato salad. Remind me--
I hate when you say that.
I NEVER do that, you ALWAYS lie!
I noticed a whopping pile of laundry sitting on the washer -- perhaps Rachel's underpants are in there -- Now where are your lunches?
I know you don't, but if you had, chrom- atically you are in the purple family.
Skylar. And by the way. That guy over there is a real dick and I just wanted you to know he didn't come with us.
Then, where are you going?
What?
112 Orchard Way. You're not coming back, are you?
I'm talking about now. How much will you give him now? Down payment?
How much will you pay him?
I know, honey.
It's for the party, Dad --
From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America. This is orange, from real Seville oranges. Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
'Goddam party'!
Yeah. She seems to be getting more comfortable on the ranch, which is why I said yes to this move. But, whenever it's just the two of us, I don't know... Anyway... what's happening with the Delco lawsuit?
Well, it's good that you're there.
Yeah, but nothing I can't handle. Lucy tells me she thinks Gottchalks's plotting, but what else is new.
You know, I just asked that myself tonight. He doesn't know.
George --
Now, George --
Fine. How are you?
What?
Poor darling. What can I do about Karen? How can I arrange to have her seduce me? She desperately needs a conquest.
If I groundloop during my flying lesson on Saturday you might wake up and find me next to you.
Not a lot of action here.
Oh, I'm fine.
They've got the real thing outside.
Where?
From the belltower the day she before she died.
So she sent you?
Yes.
Are you frightened?
Yes.
I wish you'd go now.
I come for my lady Juliet.
I want to go home.
You visiting?
My mom? Don't call my mom.
Goodbye, Bobby.
I never promised you anything.
I could've handed you to them. They find me now, I'm dead...
They just want you to hire some new help.
It was going to be a surprise!
Don t worry about it, Jack...
I m moving to Paris...it was right here... It s a box marked Jack. I put it in the stack for the Salvation Army...
Jack...God, it s been so long...You look...
It s good to see you...
Egypt!
Aren't you curious to see how your class picture turned out?
I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
Sure. Come on in.
I guess the annuals are coming in pretty soon. Are you going to get one?
Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
Brad probably has some trunks you can borrow... I'm going to my room to change!
I imagine shit needs to be done.
This afternoon before I came here. He was with Ordell at an apartment in Hermosa Beach. I don't know if he lives there, but I can find out.
Ordell has a white guy working for him named Louis.
What for?
Not really.
Now you're being silly. We don't need two cars. We have a car. And not one of thuse cheap new things made of chromium and spit. An Isotta-Fraschini. Have you ever heard of Isotta-Fraschinis? All hand-made. Cost me twenty-eight thousand dollars.
Let me go, leave me, let me go, it's ok, please.
Just say no.
I'm going to try hard not to understand the implications of that simile.
A virtuoso rendition. TOM VAN ALLEN is nothing short of dazzling in his interpretation of Miles Davis' haunting, moody piece.
It was Johnny Friendly who killed Joey, wasn't it?
What are you going to do?
What happened?
Which side do you like?
You don't like cheats, do you.
That trick tonight, I don't think I've ever seen that before.
I didn't.
That's very kind of you MR GRIFFITHS...?
But - If you could show me round now - and I'll meet you later?
Everybody's divorced.
The big one!
You can be single and not alone. Marriage bites!
Everybody knows that. Ask my divorced sisters. Or ask my divorced mom and dad.
Sure.
Well. I don't want to play "Cora."
I mean really, deeply angry...
A foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady... that's for me. And no more make believe! Off stage or on... remember, Lloyd. I mean it, now. Grown-up women only, I might even play a mother - only one child, of course, not over eight... Lloyd, will you promise not to be angry with me?
You'll be there, won't you.
I remember.
I'm going to have a home. Not just a house I'm afraid to stay in... and a man to go with it. I'll look up at six o'clock - and there he'll be... remember, Karen?
Yes yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
She's very beautiful.
Once you'd seen my sister you'd never forget her.
But she was here?
Nevermind. Any five. So four more.
Is there a difference?
Margo, again...
Does anybody live to make a second?
Don't you have a heater?
You're not sleepy?
That's not the reason. I've got a date at six thirty.
Not at all. Have a seat.
What are you going to do with me? Are you taking me to jail? You think I will turn into your informant, is that it?
Sorry I got you into trouble.
But why? I can't understand how I could just completely--
In the living room...
What's wrong with me?
This'll pass. Everybody thinks like this now and then. Come to bed.
You think you could do this like soon? It's almost six thirty.
We'll go later.
What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' I made a lot of money for you. I want my cut.
How do you do.
Thank you very much for everything.
They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
Divorced.
Listen, I'm not feeling well.
Listen, you're very nice... b...
Oh... You mean you don't want to.
You're married.
Pony, what would you say our relationship is?
Jeff!
Sure I am. It's fun.
What do you mean? His girlfriend?
Am I fucking him?
There ain't.
Then what do I do?
Know it, and go on out the yard. Go on.
Mama let me help you.
Yes... I just... did. The moment they told me...
Let me feel the strength in your hand, Chauncey... Let me feel your strength... Yes, that's good... I hope, Chauncey - I hope that you'll stay with Eve... Take care of her, watch over her, she's a delicate flower, Chauncey...
And my permission?
We'll see about that.
I haven't decided yet.
Don't deny it!
Her spiritual health.
The woman's health is at stake.
... I've worked very hard and enjoyed my life... I've known success... and I've felt love... My associates, Chauncey - I've talked with them about you... They're eager to meet you... very eager to meet you... I'm very fond of you, Chauncey... And I understand Eve... Tell her that... tell her I'm madly in love with her...
Why do I feel I needn t answer that?
...We re turning in circles.
Maybe I wanted to give my husband a fright.
It's not easy, that's for sure. Now, I may not have the best track record in the world, but I have been with your stepmother for ten years now, and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.
When was the last time you took one?
Just had one.
Like you, I'm good at it. But at this exact moment in time...like I gotta sumo wrestler on my shoulders until tomorrow morning.
Well, it's kind of skanky. Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?
Most of the time.
Tore up from the floor up?
Dad, it's not about that. I just need to know that it's possible for two people to stay happy together forever. Or at least for a few years.
I don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. This cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.
Will you be spending more than a night?
I'm real sorry, Laura.
This night is too beautiful to have again.
A lot. But you hang in there, maybe you'll get one.
So we just eat into our savings, is that the idea? I'd better call your mother when we get there. She'll be worried sick - I don't know how she's going to take this.
Why?
What does he look like?
Oh. Well perhaps you could introduce us anyway.
Turkish? Oh, if it's Turkish, that's different. I want to be in it.
Oh!
Walter, you can't do that!
Good. Now, as I trust you may have guessed, we are looking for someone to work for us. Someone whose discretion can be relied upon. Someone who while in our employ would give us full commitment. Do you think you could be that person, Mr Lombard?
You may not. And besides, it is irrelevant.
Must I speak to you in French?
Whatever, you come recommended. We...
Just go. It's all right. Wyatt, Really. Work well.
No, no, I don't want to keep you.
Are you out of your mind?
Don't be defensive. I'm just surprised to see you.
Dad around?
They said it was here. They told me this morning.
After this sort of thing, how do people manage to look at a car, let alone drive one? I'm trying to find Charles's car.
NO!...Please...Please don't make me stay...I swear...If you do, sooner or later...maybe tomorrow, maybe next week...maybe a year from now... I'll go right out the window.
Oh...
Okay. Good-bye.
Go ahead.
Monica. What are you doing here?
"Four-piece Cook's special deep fried with side n' slaw it's OUT RAY-GEOUS"!
More than you love peanut butter?
My aunt in Australia has offered..
It's so far way. I couldn't bear it.
You've been on your feet for days. And didn't even finish your salad.
Norman.
Jordan!
Nigger.
I hope that's not supposed to impress me.
Maybe. Maybe twenny days work, maybe no days work. We ain't got it till we get it.
How did you acquire this, Mister LaPlante?
What's your scheme, Mister LaPlante? What are you forcing John Bubber to do? What are you -- ?
That's right.
Tell me why!
I didn't know you cared.
What's you depth, Cab Three?
Truth?
Going over the wall. Coming to bearing 065. Everybody stay tight and in sight.
Watch your mouth.
The coach from USC is going to be at the championship.
I'm working with you because of that memo...
What you wrote inspired me. 79.
Seriously.
Where are you from, Mayo the Wop?
Polish. What kind of name is Mayo?
Is this you boys first night of liberty since you got here?
That was you guys, huh?
Come on. Let's go dance.
Better late than never, right?
Um...yes.
It's Mrs...It's Claire...Spencer. From next door. Is everything--
Who are you?
I'm not...
Hello?
Is everything alright?
Who? Your husband?
That's the truth.
In the end, the jury saw it my way.
I murdered my parents, Mr. Kelson. And while they deserved it, I still went to confession the following Sunday.
And I also believe in God and the Devil. In fact, I know they exist.
What if I told you I was a malignant narcissist?
That there is no such thing as evil with a capital "E."
Hard to miss.
You idiot! You'll kill us both!
I am not that woman.
Throw me the keys and I'll pull you up.
For Christ's sake, John! Throw me the keys!
He's still got a good grip. We need to dig more.
I could use a date.
I'd take her, but then who would stay here?
I've had enough of this shit. You're on foot, Lenny.
You got any whiskey? How 'bout giving me a glass of whiskey?
Seven years ago.
Just Johnny.
No. Unlucky. I have not been lucky.
What? Do you think you're the only one ever shed a tear?
Hola, viejo.
I like the diminished risk. It frees up capital reserves. I like working with self-interested businessmen who are competent. You can predict their behavior....
It will?
Is he leaving right this minute?
I was thinking -- what about you and... "Simone" moving back in with me and Lainey?
Then, I'll have the clam chowder... fried chicken and a baked potato with everything and a chocolate chiffon pie.
Exactly. Now that you have the studio behind you, we can really do things.
Don't thank us too fast, Viktor. You know what we have to do?
Are you going to make me beg?
Just Lenny.
I'm sorry about getting on your case earlier. I just see you getting sucked in deeper and deeper, and I -- anyway. I'm sorry.
OK. He asks about you all the time. It's been weeks since you've seen him.
You could whisper it through the walls of your cell.
I see, all right -- It's time for us to get out of this field.
Is there something I can do to help you?
What's wrong, Nathan?
You know what. You say it just to irritate me.
What?
Uh-huh. So what's he look like?
Not really. Maybe if I just saw him on the street I'd have said that, but after talking to him... he's just kind of... I don't know, unusual.
I just want to know what he looks like, is all.
Why?
Jesus, Ann, get a life. I just asked what he looked like.
Why, so you can go after him?
Do you have to say that?
Besides, even if I decided to fuck his brains out, what business is that of yours?
I'd love a Xanex. Sally, please don't tell Sophia that I'm not breast feeding.
You want a Tylenol, or something?
I'm fine. I'm fine. Well, I'm a little stressed. And I've been taking pills to get my weight down since the baby.
Whatever you like. I'm afraid it'll all be too big for you. Are you alright, Clair?
And the doctor said they might make me a little jumpy. I've got a ghastly headache, actually.
Turn over.
Yes -- to Paris? I wanted to go there always.
What?
No, I'm gonna drive.
You're driving me nuts!
Mother.
I had so many things to think about!
I can't.
Dammit! I was so close.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Okay, okay, my analyst just thinks I'm too tense. Where's the goddamn Valium?
I'm too tense. I need a Valium. My analyst says I should live in the country and not in New York.
Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
How many times....it's ok...just say... Just say...
Sam, Tony, come in here.
I would never marry anybody I didn't love.
It's the same stuff? From the rainy day stash?
Day or night?
Did you know Sebastian well?
You might say that.
No.
I don't know. I hope he never hunts. I hope he never kills another human being.
The old heroes are going to have to get used to this, Harold--the new heroes who refuse to fight. They're trying to save the planet. There's no time for battle, no point to battle anymore.
A peace officer... Impressive man
Bud, according to Monk here, you just set a record for the deepest suit dive. Bet you didn't think you'd be doing this when you got up this morning.
Rob! Two years ago you got Laura pregnant; you then proceeded to cheat on her! You borrowed money from her and never paid a dime back! And then, just a few weeks ago, you told her you were unhappy with her and were "kind of looking around for somebody else!"
Okay. Because you took the trouble to come up here. And because you've got principles. But that's it. I'm not selling them to you one by one.
-- No, no, no, don't even. I talked to Laura, Rob. I talked to her and she gave me a little background. And you're a fucking ASSHOLE.
To think I sympathized with you for two seconds! Poor Rob! Laura left him out of nowhere for the schmuck upstairs. You let me believe that!
God, he hardly even talks anymore.
I've got a boyfriend, Mark.
Unless you get caught.
Kip I -
No, they're away for the weekend. Brad and I are watching the house.
Do you want to come inside?
Me, too. I'm real sorry someone broke in and stole your tape deck.
I don't know. Probably out. Want something to drink?
Sorry.
Andrew loved this old cabin. He always dreamed about moving to Tahiti -- living in a hut and becoming a beach-bum. I could never imagine myself doing that -- but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive - - so wonderful. Soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets -- leaving the world and it's problems behind. I wish he'd had a chance to do it.
No -- not at the office. I've got a better idea.
No, it doesn't. You'll see... you get totally sick of all the creeps and losers and weirdos.
Yeah, well... So when are you going to get your job?
I'm gonna assume that was meant as a compliment, Anna, and just say thank you.
Ha, ha.
What about it?
Commercials.
It's okay, Puff.
Where are you going?
I'll miss you.
Oh. Sure, I -- Did you remember to pick up the cranberry sauce?
Please -- please!
I was referring to myself. I thought we might have a picnic tomorrow - it might be a nice change after the Wild West party tonight. Invite everybody to go to the Everglades -
Invite everybody! Order everybody, you mean, and make them sleep in tents! Who wants to sleep in tents when they have a nice room of their own - with their own bath, where they know where everything is?
I mean it. Oh, I know I always say I mean it, and then I don't - or you get me so I don't do what I say I'm going to - but -
You're in a tent, darling. You're not at home. And I can hear you very well if you just talk in a normal tone of voice.
I'm not going to have my guests insulted, just because you think - - if people want to bring a drink or two along on a picnic, that's their business. You've got no right -
How can I look at you and say this?
I know. Lloyd, let's not start putting things on this level.
I'm leavin' the place to John.
I'm sorry that I frightened you like that. But I was so touched by your concern. I've been lonely here. Perhaps we could be friends.
And if it isn't?
Sure.
What?
Oh, so now it's my fault?
I'm fine. I just need to lie down...
You want me to move?
Okay, no problem.
Look we react to every kick this baby gives, maybe Vada's trying to tell us something too.
No, it's fine. I'm fine.
He's going to have to grow up too.
Terry, you better stay in for a while. I'll come and cook your meals. Be sure you keep the door locked.
Well -- were there a lot of people in the room or just you or what?
Shelly's sick...I have to get to the bottom of this whole thing and get back there.
No...
I leave the answer to God.
I had been sold to the English. I'd rather die than fall into their hands.
No... I said "Surrender in the name of the King of France"...
I can't read.
I didn't mean that.
Tom-Tom's puncture wound is infected.
Isn't there something you want to tell me?
Yes.
I'll be up in five minutes.
Benjamin.
The number.
You what?
Will he be supervised?
Well, the last time I was up here, that's where I sat. I sat there for an hour and a half, without moving a muscle. Now and then, some fellow would sort of walk up to me and then change his mind. I'll never forget just sitting there for an hour and a half with my hands in my lap. Then I began to cry, and I had to get up and go home.
I was up here twice before. Once with a friend of mine and once I came up alone. The last time... do you see that girl in the gray dress sitting over there?
I'm having a very good time, too.
This is something recent with me, this bursting into tears at the least thing.
You're a very nice guy, and I don't know why some girl hasn't grabbed you off long ago.
Yeah.
Paul, I just want you to know that no matter how this turns out, you've run a wonderful campaign. It's been fun competing with you.
Act surprised. Walk slowly to the podium. Be modest. Thank them for this incredible honor.
Yes, sir.
Why not?
Say hi to Rob and Carrie. Have some fun!
All of these are interviews?
W-why are you telling me all this, Mr Lombard?
Bugging the District Attorney's office of New Orleans! It's outrageous!
Oh, could you, Mr. Webster ?
You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me.
I nominated you as a possible candidate. You were Eduard's good friend. He read me some of your work.
You really didn't have to come, you know. I'd have brought them straight t...
Who in the world is he?
Looks nice enough to m...
He looks familiar. Did he do a Calvin Klein ad?
Now we're going to have a fight, you and I.
Are we.
And I'm going to win.
Don't be too sure.
Right, let's go. And keep the compliments to yourself. I don't like them.
I better get home.
In D.C., my dad was the Ambassador to France in the eighties, so we went to school in Paris for a few years... but we mostly lived in D.C., and they were never around... and then I moved to Los Angeles when John and I got married... it's so different there.
No one ever tells you that...
That's nice. My parents were always traveling, they weren't around so much.
Oh.
That's too scary.
I have to take the car.
Whoever wrote this needs somebody to take the fall. And that's Phreak, and that's Joey, and that's us. We've got to get the rest of the file, so we can find out where the money is going before the worm disappears, so we can find out WHO created it.
No, of course not, but I think now that this has happened, a lot of things can start to come out...
It doesn't matter...
They're hungry.
Thank you.
No. Thank you.
Then we'd both have a miserable time. What do you think?
No, I'm not. I don't know why I said that. I've been in a very... strange mood all day. I've never done anything like that before. It's... I'm just... Well, you know, the whole world is just going nuts.
No, not at all -- except those are poisonous.
But I want you and Scott to understand. Do you think he loves Janet? Maybe he's smashed too many fortune cookies.
Oh there you are.
Have I told you how mean you're turning, York?
Borrow?! This was my dress. Maybe it's a mistake. What if I'm the only one? I don't even want to go. Everybody's just going to say... Hi.. Where's Crazy Charlie?
Who says I'm not going after what I want? My mother's thirty-nine years old and she still works in that factory. Every time I see her, I know exactly what I don't want.
You know, sometimes I wish I was one of those girls they're letting in the flight program these days. God, I'd love to fly.
I don't care what the magazines say... it's just not as easy being a girl, especially from a Catholic family. You don't know the junk I grew up listening to, 'bout the way women are supposed to think and act.
They found them like that, shriveled up from weeks without food or water...
If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
You didn't want to see me, did you?
Shit, here we go.
Yes there is. I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
Nothing.
What's wrong?
Vada? VADA?? What happened??
I should hope so.
My ball, I lost my ball.
She what?
Why didn't you come alone? Lester invited you. Did you have to bring her?
I dunno... okay, I guess... I fucked that guy Josh finally...
I mean, why are you making this documentary if you can't treat your subject with appropriate gravity?
We're not ready!
I live here. He drops in and out. He tell you about that half-million dollars he's got in Mexico?
You wouldn't do that... you wouldn't!
Please.
He went to meet that stewardess.
That's taking place outside now.
Did you like the first act?
I don't know how far you'll have to travel to find supplies, but if you can't get home by nightfall, I want you to look for something called a Holiday Inn. Write that down. It's a hotel. There might still be one standing.
You're my brave boy.
I'm afraid you've got to.
She's out, but you're supposed to wait.
I was in my p.j.'s when I remembered I left some papers I need to go over. See? I rushed right out of the house. I must look a mess. I'm so embarrassed.
Is everything fine?
Oui. Perhaps I called at a bad time. I am sorry.
Oh, Doctor. I did not know. I'm sorry to disturb you. I just came for some papers I left.
Oh, honey... What happened?
I'm leaving.
How did it go?
I'll have some coffee, please.
Your boy.
But what happened to the little deer?
Why is it just lying there? Why doesn't it get up?
My daughter died long ago.
But I saw what it was. It's the little deer.
But it was alive it was fast and strong!
Indeed. RISC architecture is gonna change everything.
P6 chip. Triple the speed of the Pentium.
No, Nancy.	You've got to sleep two more minutes.
Crash Override. What was it. "Mess with the Best, Die Like the Rest?"
Yah?
Mike...?
Uh-huh.
What was that?
But it is a part of our lives too --a part of our past, It's a Goya reproduction. Those three cats -- are supposed to be the most beautifully drawn cats in Western art.
We don't even like them, I've often thought of giving it away, but Oliver wouldn't stand for it. It was his first wife's favorite picture. She was an artist.
Oliver's pet, I'm sure it would be the first thing he'd grab if we ever had a fire.
Yes. As a matter of fact, I was on the point of telling you about it yesterday about Oliver's first marriage and his wife's death. It has so much to do with Amy although he'll never realize it.
No -- I don't want anything.
No, it wasn't...You mighta said you loved me...You mighta asked me to wait...At least that'd have been something...
I bathed him, didn't I? I fed him and cleaned up after him! If loving kindness can be called care and practical concern, then yes, I did treat him with loving kindness, and I'm not ashamed to say it.
But you saw them, sir. They couldn't hide their disgust. They don't care anything for John, they're just trying to impress their friends.
Let this locket be a token of the vow we took the night I left. He's coming home to marry me.
O.K. Thank you very much.
Just remember the needle in the haystack.
This is really very nice of you.
The money's in a Broadway shopping bag. I get some food, and sit down here in the food court. Then your girl comes -- you got somebody yet?
That's an agent. Manager's get fifteen percent.
Plus the same deal as before.
I called the asshole at 4:00 in the morning and he wasn't even home. I don't know what he's got to be mad about. I'm the one who should be mad.
I've been tellin' you that for the last ten years.
Don't get mad, Louise, but where are we going?
Oklahoma City. Jimmy's gonna wire me some money, and then...
You talked to him?! Is he mad? Did you tell him?
No, I didn't tell him. And that's something we gotta get straight. Darryl's been callin', mad as a hornet, makin' all kinds of noise. When you talk to him, you cannot say anything about this. You gotta make sure everything sounds normal.
Everything passes. Immutable law of the Universe.
Should be. It cost three hundred dollars.
Third. Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White. I come from a picture family. Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star. So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test. Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little. I went to a doctor and had it fixed. They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting.
If you please.
No... I want to be confessed.
No...
Please... may I have it back...
I called everyone, everywhere! You just vanished! You could be dead!
Where is it?
We're going to take you home.
That's okay. I'm sure I'll remember the way.
I'll call you Later.
Yes. Let's stay in touch.
It isn't her fault if she's popular... what?
I got eggs down here!
I don't grow up any more. I just get older.
You've just to love me and I'll be the happiest woman around.
Huh, really? What? Come on, I'm waiting!
Yeah.
Oh, all right.
Okay.
Really?
Yeah.
Gabriel!
GABRIEL, I LOVE HIM!
Nick...
Yes.
Yes.
There was a brown dog that ran across the road up there, right by the dump, and Dolores slowed down not to hit him, and he ran into the woods. And then Dolores drove on and turned onto the Marlowe road, as usual. I remember that. I'm remembering it pretty clearly.
You may if you can, Mr. Gittes.
Yes.
As I'm talking, I'm remembering more about it.
So what are your hopes, your dreams, what do you want to be?
Jack!... Jack!
Professor of medieval literature. Novelist. Weekend flautist.
It's my dad. He worries. Hi, Dad. I miss you too.
It's me.
I don't care. Something's going on.
Yeah, but if I win this trip, Mama'll kill me. She hates Russians. I do want to go, though... to New York, especially... but I wanted to do it...
You mean he has the power of life and death?
I -- I thought you were--
I am lonely, Yuri.
Think this about money still, ya old fool?
How many times we been over this, Laz? How many times?
She was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...
We leavin' this weekend. Deke got a friend in Mobile gonna get him a job at the water company...
So you became the hero. And I became the schmuck.
Thought we was gonna be friendly about this.
Amen.
But I swore. I promised John I wouldn't tell.
Mr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard.
Please, Eddie, don't beg him.
... honest. At least you're honest with me.
-- yes.
There'll be time for that.
It'll be over soon.
Hmm-mmm.
Aren't you eating?
Bonjour Monsieur Philipe.
Who's Monsieur Philipe?
Well, could you just make a copy of the disc? And just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? Can you do that?
Miss Wollsten!
Mrs Buttle, are you alright?
Are you alright?
Thank you. Will you bury Geoffrey? I know he's dead.
I know.
Our Garden, our garden - not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and France. The Devil's Chimney it was called - The Devil's Chimney, I don't know why. Darling. My darling.
Good night.
What?
That's the order of business. Your Bill has to stand way back there in line unless the Steering Committee decides it is important enough to be--
Yes. They give it to a sub - committee, where they really give it a going over--hold hearings--call in people and ask questions--then report back to the bigger committee--where it's considered some more, changed, amended, or whatever. Days are going by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, they think it's quite a Bill. It goes over to the House of Representatives for debate and a vote. But it's got to wait its turn on the calendar--
Good. Where are we?
PUT THE FUCKIN' PHONE DOWN, HANG IT UP.
Hang up the phone.
What are you doing?
Do you really think we're getting anywhere.
How can you, how can you say that?
But the same song. I think it's fantastic!
No, no he's not.
Oh, yeah?
Well, that was nice of him. Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax?
Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
Oh right, right, . Bader Lorenzo Died June 22 1972 Devoted husband to Nicolette. Cherished father of Babritzio and Heidi, In lieu of flowers, please send donations to the holy names society.
Yeah, I have to help my father.
The Golden Warriors.
Oh, thanks, but I'm busy.
It's all over between us, Doug, I'm sorry, but that's the truth. I've found someone else, and, it's very serious and it's the end. I'm sorry. It isn't you, j...
And I love you too.
Jake...
What?
We've got to get these kids out of here...
Please, get on the bus...
John...
John, you can't help her now.
No.
You could go and open the door.
What do you feed him?
That your spider in there? In that bottle?
Does he bite?
Well, whatta you mean? I mean, it's perfectly fine out here. I mean, Tony's very nice and, uh, well, I meet people and I go to parties and- and we play tennis. I mean, that's... that's a very big step for me, you know? I mean... I'm able to enjoy people more.
Not yet... I'm waiting for the right moment.
Hey, he's not sore, is he?
Barton!
Barton, honestly, only the last couple-
And my input was mostly... EDITORIAL, really, when he'd been drinking-
Then what's love?
Isn't there a psychological term for that, Dr. Johnson?
quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon... quot;
Where?
Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!
That's not what I'm saying at all. You know where he went?
He killed a man worked for him the other night.
Did you say Dude Finlay?
Leave her out of this!
Diane Court does not realise how good-looking she is.
Stop...
Well... I know I should reject that offer, but I'm not going to.
One or two?
Mr. Merrick, sugar?
Have you ever seen Annie Hall?
Well, there's this part of the movie that's about how there's always this tension on a first date where both people are thinking about what's going to happen with the whole 'good night kiss' thing.
Fuck you, Mr. Kane.
I just want to understand--
You will not walk out on me
Tough shit. We need to t-t-talk about this--
I don't think I can do this... I want to stand by my husband... I really do, Jeffrey. But I don't think I can do this anymore. I am so sorry...
Use the bathroom.
That's for food.
Please don't wash your hands in the sink.
Oh, God -- I think it was the fourth or fifth time I'd been there, so all I remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...
I drove over and you were gone.
What was I supposed to do? When you didn't show up Saturday, I tried to call. Your phone isn't working.
I'm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett.
I can still feel its weight. If you could have felt it, not just seen it...
Whet do you mean?
It isn't a secret. She plays with me. She plays with me in the garden all the time. Right out there in the garden, she does!
You have a vacancy?
Oh, Alvy, come on.
Oh, no, I just lost a little weight, that's all. Well, you look nice.
Now I have a plan about Rose, an educational plan. She's getting better and we don't want any more trouble -- Brother, you ought to hear this.
Sometimes the negativism and cynicism in you makes me want to vomit. Your real trouble is that you're anti-intellectual. The irony is women are supposed to be emotional, but I never saw anybody who depended more on emotion and prejudice than you do.
Honey, Dr. Martinson isn't a rascal, he's one of the finest physicians in Glenville. He studied at Johns Hopkins University.
I was talking to Mr. Carpenter.
I will be in just a minute.
Goodnight, Mr. Carpenter.
Oh, Tom, that was awful.
And also that...
For musicals? That's part of the job!
I hate you because you depart without kissing me. That's all.
No-o-o!
Oh, it's great. Fine.
Nick. It's okay... It's okay. I have to go now.
I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy....
Who was it?
He seemed like a nice guy, Alex.
So, do you like me, Seymour?
What does she mean by that - "somebody like me"?
What's her problem anyway? Did she actually tell you you couldn't see me?
Does that mean you don't like me?
You must have done something to make her think you like me.
You ought to court the Doctor's favor, not his contempt.
I see. I see the earth opening up and swallowing us all.
I was wondering whether you'd come at all..
You're no fool, George. You never have been.
Have you been reading what Minister Jefferson has to say? If he had his way, all our slaves would be freed no matter what the outcome. And that would destroy us as surely as a British victory.
And, what 'prize' do you see? What could we possible gain?
Well... I just kept wiping that dish. Maybe it doesn't sound very sexy but it was.
No, it sounds very sexy -- did you just stay by the sink all that time?
...T-thank you.
Didn't you have any panties on?
-- He reached up and tore them.
What did you do?
Yeah, they told me to get out of the house.
I'm so scared... I just keep thinking that something awful has happened. It's my fucking stepdad. I know it.
I don't know. She didn't leave a note. The house is all messed up.
Hey.
My mom is gone.
Nauseated. I look nauseated. Oh God.
Permission to get dressed, sir?
You and Sam are going to live in a garage without plumbing for the summer?
But you do have some idea how strange that sounds??? I'm worried that you did this because...
I want more.
Really? Is the food that bad?
Why, it has just made me ill, Buddy. I'm sick. I don't want to eat nothin', I don't, and me I got a good appetite, that ain't nat'ral for me. I'm ill.
I'm not kidding.
Only a few. A few. Do you like 'em?
You take care, Dorie.
Were. Isn't that what you mean? Were. Because he's dead, isn't he? And that's why you've come.
He told me about you. That he had no other friend like you.
You were more like brothers.
Well, think about it.
You know what this tape could do if it gets out.
Ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something I can't explain.
Dickie, my God!
Well done.
To my triumph, of course.
You were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. But it amused me to make you ashamed of it. You gave up on the first person you ever loved because I called you names. Don't get me wrong, I'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, I never loved you, Sebastian. You're just a toy. A little toy I play with. And now you've completely blown it with her. I think that's the saddest thing I've ever heard. Cheers.
Mother!
You're going to be ok, William. We just need to get your fever down and we'll be able to hopefully stabilize you.
What for?
What's that?
What are you talking about? It's over.
Now, Hannah, that's not what I meant, you know. Uh, yeah, everybody relies on you for so much. "You're so giving. It's not a criticism. We love you. We're grateful."
Howard.
I was her best friend.
How should I be ... arrogant?
That seems to apply to you also...
I never met anyone from Seattle before.
And Johnnie is his son, that's Johnnie Marzzone?
That's his brother.
Marzzone? As in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?
Why did you hate me?
... shit.
I promise, Jack...
Well, that's a relief.
It s been interesting, that s for sure.
You ve been Jack Campbell. And that s always a good thing...
Are you okay, Jack?
I can't help it. You don't know.....
You're grateful, but you resent me.
No, I couldn't.
What?
Oh -- that's very nice of you to tell me.
Where is the car?
Who?
No. I told you everything, you lied to me. I would have done anything for you.
I'm so ashamed dad.
No, he picked me up and carried me out to the sundeck -- God, it was hot. The wood on the sundeck, everything.
You look so beautiful.
-- He came up behind me and I was wiping a dish and he just... lifted up my skirt, and, you know, right there...
Oh, Andy, Andy!
Oh, gosh, you really think I can write?
Nah.
Go home, get drunk, and try and forget this ever happened.
What are you doing out here?
To go up.
The locks?
Thirty -five years!
Yeah, apparently. I'm having it on May 4.
I'm the Matron's favourite patient and she's shown me her special stitch!
Oh, that's marvelous. So you're almost into your second trimester, then?
Oh, it just came to me one day.
No I don't.
I beg your pardon?
Have a nice day.
Maybe... look -- just...
I don't want to lie down. I've been lying down enough.
Why don't you go lie down?
Helping all the time! Running to her every time she trips or falls... Anticipating her all the time.
You've got to stop doing that?
Yes, I slept with him but that was a long time ago.
...this is a snappy song....
Really?
I didn't say nothin' 'bout credit, Mr. Howard.
Just... wait. Just wait! Okay... please, I'm not kidding anymore...
That was just so... awful!
I couldn't believe it! I didn't think she was going to die. I knew she was sick...
Bobby -- I think it would be better if we didn't see quite so much of Mr. Carpenter
Go to bed, darling. You can finish that in the morning.
Mr. Carpenter, I-- Goodnight.
No.
Don't.
Well, why you always walking behind me?
At home you'd never hear a woman scream at a man that way.
Have you tried these? These are wonderful. Holly and her friend made them.
Christianity's silly, but at least there's something to believe in. Or not believe. Judaism there's nothing.
Oh she's a beauty.
Yo ho ho!
Yes.
No.
Oh, Matt.
Well, I'm the neighbors. There, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.
And it meant something.
Way you kiss me.
I wasn't with you.
Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow?
Well. It was a pleasure meeting you.
Always. Always. And you won't hear a voice. But in here. You'll know. What I'm saying.
Like hell you will. You'll buy me a cab.
You mean you bring other girls up here?
Why are you doing all this? To impress me?
Like fire.
You.
Yes. But not as a date date.
I'm not allowed to date.
Even pigeons aren't peaceful.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Then hie you hence to Father Laurence' cell; There stays a husband to make you a wife
Jackie says she wouldn't bring children into this world. That it's hypocritical and overpopulated.
I have.
O lady dear! Are you so hot? Henceforward do your messages yourself.
I hope they remembered to take the microwave this time?
George...
Jim, maybe we should just go. I've got to look in on the kids. Paul is supposed to be coming back in from the city.
They fired everyone.
Yes.
Pretty. You know -- it's funny but flowers only mean one thing to me now.
Jerry, I want you to be soft. You are soft -- inside - where it matters. I wanted it that day too, but didn't dare tell you.
As a matter of fact I did. They've got some work to do tonight, but they're gonna come tomorrow.
No thank you.
Why won't he talk to women?
I have to throw up...
What do you do?
Yes.
Are you ill?
I feel as if I've eaten glass.
What do you feel?
No.
For me to get sick in.
What do you think it's there for?
Yeah. Nice touch. It's the logo from "You Bet Your Life", right?
Didn't you tell me to be patient with my career?
It's not going to well?
Well, I should be getting...
Hey, at least it's not Goofy.
I'll think you'll find our Mr. Bayliss is not keen on seafood. I've got lamb chops in the 'frigerator.
I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. Was it --
Oh, all right! Well...Martin says...
It's stupid.
I want to go home. I don't like it here.
I don't want to.
It's not that.
leads a young man-JOHN-into the dining room.
I didn't do anything.
Where?
What?
It's not too bad. Will it take a long time before it's better? Our big swim meet is in three weeks. Interschools. I was going to swim in the one hundred meter freestyle.
Yes.
That's ridiculous.
Ed, it's just one man's opinion!
Well maybe you're not studio kind of material. Maybe you just need to raise the money yourself.
Gotta go, Donna. I'll call you tomorrow.
Not tonight.
Hey, that was... intense.
Are you going to tell me your deep dark secret before we have sex?
So?
Don't you think I should know before we have sex?
I don't know.
It's terrific!
Do you have any evidence against him, Jim? Clay Shaw's done so much for the city with all that restoration in the Quarter. He's well connected, all his friends, the money, people, be careful, Jim.
Settle down? I got 74 bucks to my name, Mr. Masry! I can't afford to settle down!
All right, Walter.
Just a second, Walter. Here, Bruce, here's the check... And, oh, Bruce, here's your wallet. I got it back.
Fine.
Oh, for Pete's - a course they do! Every time they raise the darned postage, people need the little stamps!
It'll be fine, yeah.
You're joking.
No.
Yes. I'm sure he's hoping you'll pack me full of prozac so he can live out his life in peace.
They ever love you back?
I don't know how to walk in heels.
Hey. You just worry about playing your behind off for that recruiter tonight. Let me worry about your date.
You ever been in love?
You do.
Yeah, right.
And here I've made you all hot and sweaty.
Really?
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny What I have spoke: but farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,' And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st, Thou mayst prove false. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
Cole, please stop.
That's what he keeps telling me.
Do not swear: although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night! This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night.
So what s the big surprise? You didn t rent this place for the weekend, did you?
It s like a museum.
For the week?
Hey, Jacques...
-- Your employer?
Lives high off the hog and waits for the next big thing. Like me -- but on a grander scale of failure.
I am The Muffin.
What if you couldn't find him ? Sergeant, not today, please. Not this morning.
Get out!
But it's not on the schedule!
Oh and I don't because I have a children?! The problem is you're too self-involved to ever be a mother.
Ice cold water.
You got to hell!
Okay... Who'd you meet?
Ouch. Yeah?
Dave.
It's OK, I guess. No, I don't really. I'm not big on music, ordinarily.
I disagree. I think we should start looking into the severance pay schedules and make sure the people with families can.....
God, yes!
Maybe we should make the time. Especially considering the sixteen million dollars we have set aside expressly to settle law suits from these very events.
You want her to call you Jack?
That's fine. Can I have a telephone number, area code first on where we can call you back?
Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
Why not?
Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
Where are you taking us now?
That's fine. It's nice to meet you.
Yes, James is very sweet. Why don't you get out your violin, Donna?
Sweet? God, he's gorgeous.
Well, why not?
Because Bobby is a loser, you said so yourself. He's a goon. James is the one. He loves you with that "lasting love"... "true love".
Do you think that if you were falling in space you would slow down after a while or go faster and faster?
Faster and faster. For a long time you wouldn't feel anything. Then you would burst into fire... forever.
James is very sweet and very gorgeous.
But your friends are my friends. My friends are your friends. I don't think it would work. You have a little something on your upper lip.
You're really serious, aren't you?
Okay, I suppose I should go home.
But what about the past? Our past?
You're inhuman.
Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
You killed Mike.
At least you were never lonely.
You don't miss it?
But you had so much responsibility .
Just a little privacy.
Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there...
I'm sorry, but unfortunately I don't fuck losers.
You don't have to entertain me.
That's right. Will you see that Mr. Sheldrake gets it?
Open it.
I'm not very good at it.
Hello?
Write! Let's just not talk about it anymore.
Miles?
What is it?
That's what you think. I drink tons of booze so you might get one of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.
Four thirty. I'm meeting a woman.
You know... it's parts...
He wouldn't say. You gonna follow her?
But you're not going to stop her?
No!
You know, certain words and phrases just keep floating through my mind, things like incarceration, cavity search, life imprisonment, death by electrocution, that sort of thing. So, come out alive? I don't know. Let us think about that.
Not anymore.
You okay?
Don't worry. I can protect my virtue. I mean, c'mon, Wade, give me a break.
Really?
Once you put the hotels on board walk and Park Place he puts a shoe in your way.
All right, Bud... let's do it.
The good outwitting the bad. It's like Birdson had a split personality.
You're already contaminated. It's why you couldn't hear the tape. There's probably a pentacle near your bed. To sanctify you.
I know this sounds crazy. I understand. Check your parents' blood types. Are you sure your parents are your birth parents?
Is there nothing I can do, Roy, nothing at --
What did you do to them?
How many girls did you molest?
You're not joking.
I can make this wall without --
I didn't know they let you try again. Especially at your age.
Sir...
It looks like pixie dust... Kent would've given anything to see this. David, too.
I didn t know who or what had happened to my brother yet, Mr Lombard!
Something like that.
Something like that.
Simplify and damn.
It's so... small.
If I stayed, I wouldn't be starting!
I have to answer him.
Why do you have to defend her?
We're waiting, Hubert.
Nonsense.
There is?
It's very nice.
Yeah?
Is that all, Mr. Barnes?
I'm sure I --
That's what he did to me. Swept me right off my feet -- and left me lying on the floor.
I don't live far from here. You and your dog can come home with me and have yourself a hot meal and then we'll talk about how to get you back home.
You're so nice, Bruce, you think everybody else is.
He comes by it naturally. His grandfather was a snake.
You don't usually talk to anyone when you're hurting.
Scott, You can't save everyone.
What do you want from me?
Prince Albert was going to build a bench here. He thought it one of the best views in Osborne.
You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so.
Then why do you persist in doing it?
We've been over this a dozen times. No.
No... but...
Three days. Are you hungry?
Where are you staying? The Holiday Inn?
See? I'm psychic. Not completely, but pretty much. That was pretty good, wasn't it?!
Yes, I'm right?
I knew it! So anyhow, you get on a bus and before you know it, you're out here in the San Fernando Valley without a clue. Which brings us to here. Correct again?
Yeah. Thanks. Anyhow, let me predict a bus for you to get on.
Someday you can. We all believe that...
It hurts.
Everywhere!
Hi.
My ankle.
But she'll have no one to look after her!
Juliet's infectious . . . she'll be going to hospital.
Her parents won't be going overseas now . . . they'll have to cancel their trip. Don't worry about Juliet.
Are you okay?
pops a couple more potatoes on Pauline's plate. HERBERT glances at Pauline.
I've booked you in for a chest X-ray . . . just to be on the safe side.
How old is he?
How? How can you see anything?
I'm turning you.
I should try and move your bed. I want you to be able to see the view. It's good, it's a view from a monastery.
To a hard night's work, son. Come on!
Hurray!
I told you I'd come back.
We, we have to give it.
No. They've passed on.
Where's the soap?
Hey, you should be more careful. That's my ma and pa.
I'm sorry. They live here, too?
Thanks.
You're no Venus de Milo.
If you want to come in and wash your face - I can get you some hot water to get that dirt off your trousers -
Uh-huh... A what?
Uh-huh.
Fine.
Lighten up.
No?
Oh dear, are you actually laughing?
Oh. thank you.
What about those other guys you live with?
Did your mother know you were going to see your father?
It's just a question, it's not about anybody.
Dad, when a boy likes you, does he pretend that he doesn't like you? And if he pretends that he doesn't like you how can you tell that he likes you?
Hi. I hope I'm not disturbing...
Would you do something for me? I need you to check and see if there's a lump in my breast. I can't afford to throw money away on a doctor.
Don't you know you drove everybody mad?
Scream.
Yeah.
Well, not exactly s...
Sex. Of course.
Daddy was washing Rachel. In the shower. What did you think that was about?
Sweet Jesus.
MOMMY!
He was going to take the money.
Yeah.
Sheriff Potter.
It hurts too much.
Gino Marzzone is coming tonight to pick up the money?
Do you even know who Terry Valentine is?
If he eats one tiny piece of a nut --
He's allergic to everything, don't worry about it --
I have to see SEN. I've just been given a shift change.
Where's Johnny?
Frank...what's wrong?
Gino Marzzone is coming to your apartment. It's a big deal, isn't it? That means Caesar will be ready. He doesn't want to look like an idiot. Gino has been there before?
We're going to be fine.
You know Sid Fletcher?
You know Sid Fletcher?
But I love you, Laura.
He's making plans for Brighton. He thought we could travel down together.
In your car
Hello. Anyone for a walk? Tom isn't, I can tell you.
I can't do that. I haven't been being fair to Carl. I have to tell you that.
No, I can't...
No, you don't have to, it isn't necessary...
I'll be back later...
Upstairs. Johnny Cammareri showed up last night.
Just what?
Alright, forget it if you're not going to be serious,
Alright, now. You want to know why CBS has the highest ratings? You think their news is any different from NBC, ABC? It's all the same news. Same stories. Same order usually. What, you thought they had good news for people, right? You thought that's why people watched CBS? I'll tell you why people watch CBS. Cronkite. The man. You got it? Not the news, not the issues, the man. If Walter Cronkite told people to eat soap, they'd do it. We are selling cars, goddamn it.
Maybe if you'd try thinking once in a while, you'd get somewhere.
That's the last. The finish. Period. Some people can learn. Some people can't. And you wonder why we never get serious --
I do.
I loved it. It sounds peculiar, but I loved every minute of it. I did. Eddie was travelling a lot, so he was gone, but I felt like I always had a piece of him with me. A little part of his soul inside me. I could feel it. It was alive and kicking.
I know, Dad. I know...
-- Just get me out of here, baby. I can't stand it. It's killing me.
Never mind. I'll just eat my lunch.
I want to go home.
When do we bring'em back?
It won't hold.
No.
No. I haven't done it in years.
I have.
It didn't get there from me.
No -- never.
They said that'd be tomorrow. They just wanna keep an eye on me another night.
Thank you.
Give up being a croupier, Jack. Or I'll shop you. All you have to do is keep your word. It's that simple.
Nothing about you.
You're already alone.
Here...use a spoon.
Why did you take the money?
Well, if you could just come for the day. New York's only a few hours by plane, I'd have you home by dinner...
You disgust me... even if what you say is true.
Mookie, I told you already it's too fucking hot to make love.
You a blue-moon fool.
You think God forgives people like that? You think God forgives people like me?
It's Charlotte.
Thanks for getting me back in one piece.
Do you want to have some breakfast?
Up there... I... eh... can't explain... But that's the only place you could be from.
I know.
Closed.
My... husband.
Yes -- If I didn't believe that, I'd die after last night.
Yes.
Agent Novak?
Do you feel there's a side of yourself you don't show people?
With Stargher I saw things...
I spent a wretched night. It would be wonderful if I could get tuberculosis, too.
There it is. Give it to me.
How do I load?
Where's the bullet?
I mean it!
I'm turning off the alarm. I'm turning off everything.
What?
Smells like dirt.
When?
You know, right up until you said that -- I thought I did know.
Which is guy-speak for...
Wai', wait. What happens if it works? Four months of training, three years of operational duty. What then?
Sorry. But after our days... So if I try this thing... if I ship out to Coronado... what happens here?
Get your dick back here. It has everything to do with you.
Thank you.
We won because Christ...triumphed over Satan?
So, if Christ won, that means, what does that mean, Father? That Satan...
So I guess Satan lost. Satan is the weak one.
Sure. You alright? Is this still that contest you're in...
Who said anything about the fucking street. I've got more connects than you have, Lieutenant...
Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
What's that noise?
-- never mind.
He's a hairdresser.
-- no.
It's safe.
They're good, Norm, but you're better'n them.
Yah.
You bet. Thanks for lunch. What do we got here, Arbie's?
...How's the paintin' goin'?
Aw, hon, you're better'n them.
What about the moon?
You get down here!
Bye...
This is day care. It s where babies go when their parents are at work.
I have winter camp until four, then ballet until five thirty.
Try not to be late because kids don t like to be the last one picked up.
He'll be sedated. I know horses, Robert. I'm the one who taught Grace how to ride.
I'm in charge. I went back very soon after the accident. They didn't expect me for a couple of months. I'll just take that time now... I can still oversee things from Montana... Take my fax... My computer...
No. I was just researching. Calm down.
I'm not asking you to. I'll do it.
Why?!
I think you should give up diving. It's dangerous.
I know you are, but you have to stop. I couldn't tell you before, I didn't know if I should. But you have to stop before you hurt yourself.
WHAT??
Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
And if you don't?
Why? It's such a simple thing. You just let me out and I disappear down a road and you never have to see me again.
You know where you're taking me. You know what she'll do. Just give me a minute, slow down, give me an instant for once in your life, please?
Well, it's too late now, isn't it?
Did he touch you?
He wouldn't do that.
You don't know that for sure.
-- another rainy day. Whatever shall we do?
No, but I did.
You touched him?
You know, we're okay. They're not finding us. You'll remember me in the morning. And you'll come to me and tell me about us and we'll start over.
You remember what happened next?
Hell no.
Because he cared so damn much about you and me, child.
He can't drink this milk. It'll make him sick. He's on a formula. I was a fool! I shouldn't have kept him with me.
What things made you so sure?
Nick, you'll drive me crazy. What things?
What makes you so sure it's Wynant's body?
Wynant's body?
Jabez ...
And you're worried about him.
I'm sorry to hear that, Jonah.
Why not?
Still clear.
The sub's a 100 feet in front of you. You see it?
What's the matter?
Still clear.
Yes, Norman. I did. You're just nervous.
You can't. Counter's at 10 minutes. You don't have time.
Neither can mine. She's dead. It's Shelly who's pregnant.
What are you staring at?
Yup. That's him goin'. I love to watch him go.
Thelma kinda took to him.
Don't mind me, Jimmy, I'm just a wild woman.
A regular outlaw.
Sure.
Yes.
Have you made up your mind?
Did your mom say if Lenny was... okay?
Get outta here. Could I speak to you privately?
I begged him not to go. And he did.
Mmm, I never get upset over that. Mmm?
Hannah, I have to borrow some more money. Don't get upset.
Oh, sure.
It's so stupid. Says to me that he don't want nothin' to do with no military career. Says he wants to move. Open up an auto shop with his uncle up in Knoxville. I said, okay. How about now? Let's go.
Can't be thinkin' bout him every second of my day. I'll go outta my gourd.
I love you, Mama. I love you, Dad.
Who ever thought they'd be right for once? Jesus, Harry... it's a zoo back there --
What do you mean, what kind of gobbledygook talk is that?
This conversation is making me a little sick.
Really?
That's enough, Bobby. I think it's time you went to bed.
I think we've all been hearing too much about "space men."
Oh, I can't. I don't know.
Oh Patrick, I can't make this decision.
Oh, I don't know. No, we'll go anywhere you want.
And a fact is a fact.
You want to canvass?
Charles Palantine. The man you want to volunteer to help elect president.
Is that so? But what do you think of Charles Palantine?
Well, that's not exactly what the Senator has proposed. You might not want to canvass, but there is plenty more other work we need done: Office work, filing, poster hanging.
George, if you keep this up I'm going to scream.
Is he your friend?
What's he like?
Well, that's the main thing--don't you think so?
When I was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. So did this family down the road. I used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. It wasn't easy. The stone walls were high and I'd scrape my knees as I climbed over. On the other side were wild rose bushes. The thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as I lowered myself down.
Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.
He's a ghost!
No, open it...
I found it at an outlet store. I know it s a knock-off, but I think it ll look great on you...
Enjoy it, sweetheart...
What are you talking about? You never wait all day. You can barely wait until it s light out.
Mami, the first time I brought him home, those were your exact words-- "some chulo with grease under his nails."
...while she watched the kids. Then, you booked this flat in Paris for your family's summer. But she said...
Let me put it this way. Hell, no.
By way of saying you were unhappy.
Cereal.
Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! I am not a fool. I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. And now they attack Brown too.
Hey, Mitch.
Thank you.
What are you talking about?
Aren't they great?
And bring my knees up, real hard, yeh?
A month from today?
How near is she to death?
Then let's set the date.
How about a month from today?
-- so when are you going to Egypt?
You're going?
Now I didn't mean that, you rat.
Hi... what's going on here?
Yes, of course. Why wouldn't I be?
We were just sorting things out.
It was on the television.
And belief follows?
After the meet. Back to Baltimore.
I thought... I was hoping we could play it straight with one another.
You, too, Roy.
That's that's that's that's beautiful...
May I have your coat?
Don't bother, I can take it up myself...
Oh yeah ... Gorgeous.
Oh, Biff. You can "pin" me any time you want to.
The hors d'oeuvres are here. Is there anything else I can do?
Thank you, Eve. I'd like a Martini - very dry.
And you...? Do you love Enzo?
No, I'll get you some tea. Wait till you're in Naples. You'll find a girl there.
Maybe she has.
Calm down, I'm just asking. Is that hash I can smell?
I wouldn't mind a bit, if it is.
Are you clean?
Smells like it.
Honest, Toby. I just axed him for a quarter for the jukebox.
What does it say there?
Where is he?
That's all right, Mr. Bernstein.
Thais.
You do?
Are you taking Janet to the reunion tonight?
OH! How about "Under the Sea?"
So you framed him. The same way Childs was going to frame Pike.
What happened with Nunez?
...I'm sorry.
There was nothing I could do. Batman deactivated her. She's dead.
Make yourself right at home.
Kill them. Of course. But why stop there? Why should only Batman and Robin die while the society that created them goes unpunished?
Just what I had in mind. Everything dead on Earth except us. A chance for mother nature to start again. Plants and flowers are the oldest species on the planet yet they are defenseless against man. Sorry hon, this is for science. Behold the dawn of a new age.
I have created a race of plants with the strength of the deadliest animals. Once you have frozen mankind, my mutants will overrun the globe. The Earth will become a brave new world of only plants. And we shall rule them. For we will be the only two people left in the world.
You got that right.
Joel, come here. Please.
What if?
Oh, um...
Make love?
That's okay. I --
Well, that...th-that's fine.
Till then.
On the train?
It wasn't business. It was pleasure.
Yes. Why do you find that so hard to believe?
Forget it.
You really need to lighten up.
Yeah, well, thanks for sticking your head in.
I don't know. Sometimes I feel stupid babbling about my little problems while children are starving in the world.
I didn't say it was rational, I just said I was convinced.
Loud.
Don't do this to me now, Joel. Really.
So what's going on, Joel?
Thanks.
I know.
Are you okay ?
Why don't you shut up and fuck me, Professor.
Since when?
Don't bring it home in this.
What does Clifford say?
Found? Where?
Who?
Really?
A rich actress.
Well, you wanted the girls to have the best teachers.
Isn't the helmet magnificent?
If what you say is true, it is a matter for the police!
But why risk yourself? Hasn't this family suffered enough?
Do you know this man? Is there something between you?
Oh, God...
Oh?
Thank you.
Oh?
You're not Vice, are you? Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
Really??
You're still dressed?
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
You may do that in the privacy of your room.
Do you have any particular choice of girl?
Nn-nn... Nn-nn... no... N'RONNIE!
It's been 84 years...
The world. Thinks I'm gone. But only the magician. Knows better.
Half. Of him.
Promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.
Really?
I'm going to throw up.
Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him.
I got an awful bad cold.
Piddle. She smiles and looks for the bathroom. She finds it and is going to go in when she sees the head of a man in the bath, walkman on. She withholds a shout and gets against the wall, without moving. She doesn't dare passing before the open door again to join Leon. In the living room, Leon still thinks.
What shall we do?
I do, I do. I'm sure I'm just...how was your day?
Alex, I think it's time for you to stop.
It's so terrible I can't tell you. Oh, Buddy, you don't know how it hurts to have a broken heart, what a terrible feeling it is, and I've had a broken heart so many times. Men, I don't understand them, I can't figure them out and they break my heart, that's all. I can't find Mr. Right, Buddy, I can't find him no matter how hard I look, all I find is a whole pile of Mr. Wrongs. But this is the worst ever because it wasn't his fault. It was my fault, oh yes, my fault, I was bad -- oh God, I was bad, you wouldn't believe how bad I was.
What, are you going to like have sex with her on your first date?
What? You're kidding me...
So, what happened?
M'hm.
Yeah.
M'hm.
Do you still want to do something tonight?
That hasn't stopped you before.
I am going to lock him up.
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines.
When?
So you'll call me, right?
I don't know. I'm not sure there's a big public demand for books on Calvinism and Misogyny.
I'm glad you called.
A religion instructor at Columbia. A good guy. He's a good guy.
Hi, Chief. You like the suicide?
Hello, Mister Wallace.
Did you get it? Jesus, did I say that?
Not at all. It was fascinating.
I know I should go. I know I have a tendency to get involved with unavailable men, and...I mean, do you want me to go?
I'm willing to be overcharged. Tell me.
We said "no questions."
A franc for your thoughts.
I don't know if I can.
We bought him in Kentucky. My mother and I took a trip down there to see him.
I want to be with him always...
He was right behind me !
Fine. Is it going ok?
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt, but it isn't any more. Mr. Norton wants to get back of it and sponsor John Doe Clubs all over the country. He wants to send you on a lecture tour.
Uh-huh . . .
Uh-huh.
What was our deal when we first got together? Brutal truth, remember?
Jerry. You and I are salespeople. We sell --
I have to finish my job --
It's not "love me." It's not "trust my handshake." It's make the sale. Get it signed. There shouldn't be "confusion" about that.
...I don't know, Daddy seems funny to me. Ever since Joe showed. It's like he dropped from the clouds...
No one else heard it?
He said what?
...We're never all together two nights in a row. Maybe Christmas, Thanksgiving, that's it. What's going on?
That's not technically accurate - SIMPSONS murders weren't sexually motivated.
What am I supposed to do?
What do you think?
It's got a bottom.
Maybe. Maybe not.
I can't change either. Not unless somebody wants me enough to give me a hand.
I'm fool enough to believe that one of these days somebody will. Somebody who wants me as I am will maybe walk into the place where I'm working and take me out of there.
...I can't do it, Wally...
It's so pitch-black tonight. I feel lost.
Gimme Western four-five-five-seven.
Mission Hospital? Gimme the Receiving Room.
Hello -- Eddie? Hildy Johnson. Was there an old lady brought in from an auto smashup?
Nobody? Morningside three-one-two-four.
Roderick, you know well enough that I have never loved but you! Was I ever so wretched that a kind word from you did not make me happy? Ever so angry, but the least offer of good-will on your part did not bring me to your side? Did I not give a sufficient proof of my affection for you in bestowing one of the finest fortunes of England upon you? Have I repined or rebuked you for the way you have wasted it? No, I loved you too much and too fondly; I have always loved you. From the first moment I saw you, I saw your bad qualities, and trembled at your violence; but I could not help loving you. I married you, though I knew I was sealing my own fate in doing so, and in spite of reason and duty. What sacrifice do you want from me? I am ready to make any, so you will but love me, or, if not, that at least, you will gently us me.
Well--enjoy the natural, honest, unrehearsed result--surgical shock.
Fine.
It's important that I learn this.
No.
I know, but you're broke. Where are you?
Last week would this be?
No.
Good.
There's nothing to tell.
Benjamin, don't you ever take that girl out.
Do you understand that?
Good.
Do you want to talk to Zoe?
Why is everything about you, Jeff?
He'll get his place too -- now off with your clothes and into bed.
Now don't you think it's time you told me all about yourself?
Is your back still killing you?
Mister LaPlante, I really want to help you, but crazy stories are only going to make it worse. The D.A. is asking your bail be set at twenty-five thousand dollars because you were arrested again while you were out on bail...
Because if you do--I'll leave you. HAROLD Goodbye.
Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
She's not home yet. Take off your coat and come in the living room. I'll make you a drink. I wanna talk to you.
Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun. He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
One kiss, my love. For luck.
Bad luck, I'm afraid. It's time to die, little bird.
You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.
"Klaatu barada nikto."
Think about your father. Your sister.
And only talked about killing Manzetti to convince them you were an anti-Semite. If you'd had any idea somebody would take it seriously, you never would have said it.
Who's Frank?
You can?
Hey, how are you? BARRY I'm fine, hi, how are you?
I'm just stopping by to say hello.
I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking.
How'd you meet Early?
And here. Here.
Um, I'm gonna need a bag. If you could just ask the guy for a big bag, okay?
You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want?
If you don't want me to pose for him, why do you want me to meet him?
What for?
You're just gonna walk?
What're those?
We have a very nice pasta today. Alla Putanesca.
Alla puttanesca.
Elliot?
Elliot Litvak. Have you been ill? And Mr. Rogan. How nice.
Is it a poem?
Jacques? I'm pregnant.
Daddy. Does your friend have a name?
May I offer you some tea, Herr Mozart?
Wolfi!
Wolfi, I think your father's tired. I'll cook us something here.
I keep waiting for the next novel to come out. Anything in the works?
What!
I love you.
No! At least I don't think I am!
As below, so above. You hold the univers, Willow, in your hand.
Oh right. The mustache coffee cup. The one that was sitting on the dash.
That one.
And no one knows but us...
In a village called Domremy.
Why?
You never spoke so well of him.
You lie.
You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
And in return?
... And while its function remains, for the moment, a mystery, my best guess is that it represents a transport of some kind.
Excuse me.
I... submit to Our Lord.
The Stardust Ballroom. It's loaded with tomatoes.
You just sit here, I gotta turn the fire on under the cooking.
We gotta ask Marty, of course.
Nice work, Captain sir.
What? He's going to be all right!
She ate.
Infant death, he calls me. Sweet daughter death. You know what he calls you? Merciful death.
What are you talking about? You're disappointed every minute of your life.
The way I learn everything. By watching you.
But you never let me see you kill, Louis.
Where did you get this?
You need a bigger place - this is like a little kid's room.
Let me do that.
That's great! "Half-empty" - that's what I like about you, Seymour, you're a natural pessimist!
She was only teasin'.
Jesus, how can you stand her?
We allus thought you was strong enough to carry it. Was we wrong?
I allus hoped to see you well fixed and have me a crop of grandkids to kiss and fuss around with.
Sometimes I wisht people was like dogs, Luke. Comes a time, a day like, when the bitch just don't recognize her pups no more, so she don't have no hopes nor love to bring her pain. She just don't give a damn. They let you smoke?
No it hain't, Luke. You ain't alone. Ever whar you go, I'm with you, and so's John.
Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
You're going to Hollywood - aren't you? From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
I might.
That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
The maid'll fix it in the morning.
I'll just pick up the broken glass.
Don't bother.
How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
Adam, where are you?
You are a virgin!
They've closed the set. They sent everybody home.
I'm just guessing.
Maybe you just need to give her some time. She's so nice, Brad. Everybody loves Lisa.
Hey, Brad. Are you still a virgin?
I don't know. I was just curious.
Yeah.
You actually got around to killing someone. I'm impressed. I guess you're only half a bitch.
I haven't. No, the reason why I ask is I think it might make a great, uh, television script, and, you know, you're so active in television, so--
No, I haven't.
You're kidding me.
Sleep okay?
I'm not sure, yet... I graduated last spring.
Philosophy.
I don't know, but I can think about it, a lot.
Thanks. I'm sure your mid-life crisis will work out,too.
We have the ability to change the color, odor, and physical property of cocaine.
No, we have to get this story.
Well, what do we do? We drove all the way out here.
Go away. Who are you --?
Alone. All alone. Oh, you strange -- strange creature.
Strange man...
Not quite strange now. It is as if I had been expecting you. You know, once when the Grand Duke was alive, I found a man hiding in my room -- a young officer --
He disappeared. Later he was found dead.
Last time I saw you.
Seeya tomorrow.
That's murder!
What?
No, I don't think so. I --
I don't know. I'm completely in the dark here. That's what I get for moving away.
My Lord. It must feel real nice living inside your head with Peter Pan and the Easter Bunny.
I can't believe she never told me? We spoke at least once a week. How could she do that?
Do you know who put it there?
Neither is acting. Not if you're serious about it. Can I have one of these?
I know, right?
Romeo, O Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name; Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
That bastard! I'll gladly dispose of him in the name of the order, Son of Malkovich.
Did it go well, darling?
Yes, and they send their kisses. Would you like your sherry now?
Whatever that means. Open your presents.
Well... OK...
Thanks, I do understand. I was worried about how that would be... but now I'm not. And you should know that included with the rent here is a complimentary blow job.
I know that...
What secret shall I tell?
You want anything special for dinner?
C'mon, Seymour, please?
I'm supposed to be leaving on a fellowship that I worked for my entire life. I don't even care. I met this boy over the summer, and I, I can't see him because of this, I can't talk to him, I can't talk to my father about... I wore these clothes, I thought, I thought that if I looked right and if I acted right then someone would talk to me. But I look awful and I feel awful, could you, could you please talk to me? Be a little decent.
Bye....
I was born jaundiced. Once I sat on a toilet seat at a Truck stop and caught hemorrhoids. And i've learned to live with this chicken Bone that's been lodged in my throat for the past three years, so I knew Dad would be devastated when he learned of my latest affliction. Dad, I don't wanna upset you, but my left breast is developing at a significantly faster rate than my right. It can only mean one thing. Cancer. I'm dying.
Before Voyager we expected maybe a dozen rings --
Maybe debris from a moon that broke apart.
Could be...
That is my telescope.
Yah? Well, even the best mom in the world, the smartest, the wisest, whatever. Needs to know when to find a Plan B. Cos Plan A is not and will n...
Can I say one thing? I mean, the last thing I want to do is inter- fere on the Brad thing, b...
Thanks, but it's under control.
Yeh, she's...I'll get you Ben first, it's past his bedti...
How's she doing with Brad?
Did you sleep well?
Do you want breakfast?
Are you awake?
Anyone else?
Is that a threat?
Who? Who? Who thinks that?
Mac? Mac says it? Cal?
Cal, too?
It's a shit novel anyway.
I think you're the liar.
Yes.
Should I?
The Big Boy did...?
That's not right.
Hello, Marty, when you coming home? Where you now? Because your cousin Thomas and his wife Virginia, they're here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine... I don't know...
If only it were that simple.
Yes, exactly!
Worse I'm afraid.
Penguin? Oh, Cal! He is them.
No.
Will you join me for dinner?
Stop accusing me!
And... I don't know... I mean, six months ago I-I woulda done it. I woulda done it, just to please him.
Constantly! I'd say three times a week. Like the other night, Alvy wanted to have sex.
That day in Brooklyn was the last day I remember really having a great time.
All right, all right, you don't wanna go to the party, so uh, whatta you wanna do?
Well, I've been moody and dissatisfied.
I'm saying it now!
-- more than anyone she has ever met. In her whole life.
Well, are you? Are you queer?
What was that?
I'm sorry. I know I heard noises... the detective's wife...
C'mon, don't make an issue of it. Do you want the fucking meatloaf or not?
playfully shoves his hand away.
Ted, do you love him?
I've had nice things before but I always ruined 'em somehow.
I don't want you to let go.
Well--I--
Oh, I don't know...
Who the hell cares?
It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
That's always been my problem.
Czar for life, just like a real czar.
Good night.
Hello, Jeff. Yes, I'm all right.
I don't want to talk to him.
For me?
No. Before anyone moves, you two shake hands and don't carry it any further.
Is your name Paul Benjamin?
I just want to know what your game is, mister, that's all.
-- Well it was very hot so I'd left the door open and the water was running so I didn't hear him come down the stairs...
What?
Why? What have you been thinking about?
Caroline --
-- I was in the kitchen doing the dishes and George was out in Long Beach doing a show...
Why are you so into Pinot? It's like a thing with you.
Lotte called me.
Wow, you get a whole room in your own house? She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.
You should be happy, Holmes. I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life! And you don't even have to be there when the baby comes out of me all covered in...
Blood and guts.
I'll say you are. Let's do it on his kitchen table, then make him eat an omelette off of it.
I had a good neighbor, George. She was 60 and Mexican and she watched my kids for free. Something tells me you're not gonna be able to measure up to that.
Is Jeremy okay?
Return 'em. Maybe you'll get your money back.
Cause I don't even know you.
Arnie, thank God.
I'm not gonna leave my kids with you.
Call me.
No you don't. You're pissed, that's all. You ought to cool off for a few days then have a long talk with Lillian. You know? Work it out with her, tell her how you feel. Lillian's not out to get you.
You don't mean that.
Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
Because you act like a pig.
I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
Get it out of here!
Are you alright?
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
His name is Romeo, and he's a Montague; The only son of your great enemy.
I bade her come. God forbid! Juliet! Juliet! Juliet!
If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away.
You've been with Gray again.
Dolores.
Absolutely.
What do I have to do?
I know it's hard for you being in here, but it is for the good of your health.
I don't like flowers.
How bout Twinkies? My mom won't ever buy them.
What's wrong?
The shrink? Many times.
Bernstein... seemed to think I hated men.
Not too much, don't cut too much.
Friend of his. They play duets together.
Oh, swell! Is that the contract?
We'll clean him up and put him in a hotel room under bodyguards. We'll make a mystery out of him. Did you speak to Mr. Norton?
Yes, but not because he's out of a job. That's not news! This man's going to jump as a matter of principle.
Are you kidding?
Oh!
Yeah...it's not...it's been on for a bit --
Do you have a pen? This one's out of ink.
Yes.
I'll think about it.
I have to go back now.
Can't you stay a bit longer, Paul?
Amen.
We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it.
Good. I'll show you how, apey.
You what?
Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason.
Ned's share?
Yes, Ma'am.
Silky an' Faith, they rode off to the East an' two deputies was followin' them.
It's okay really, I was just a baby.
That s all I wanted to hear...
Are you the Hillary Mitchell who went to school with Maggie Muldovan?
Rose, you and Brother wait in the car. I want to speak for a moment Lo Mr. Hillyer.
No.
You know how your Daddy is.
I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old?
Are we just going to go on sitting here?
I say hang the bastard out to dry, let her see him for the heel he is, then maybe she'll step to the all-girl team and let mama-licious ease her pain.
Only one I can think of.
So are dogs.
No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so.
Please...
Friends don't help other friends cheat.
Huh! Who do you think we are, Mr Lombard?
You're my sweetheart.
Dolores, can't you be a little kinder to people? You don't even know the boy. If you weren't so neurotic and insecure, maybe you'd shut up for a while and show some compassion.
Touchy, touchy!
First of all, Richard is not a creep. He happens to be an exceptional person. If any of you gave him half a chance, you'd find that out.
I will I promise.
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
So you and I can fuck while your parents are out having dinner at the Sizzler? What are we doing, Jeff? You and me?
I . . .
I'm sorry Walt -- it's gone beyond that.
I had a fight with Jake. I . . . I just wanted to get away for awhile. Mr. Stewart was kind enough to take me as far as Montrose. I'm going to take a bus to my sister's. I thought I'd stay with her for a few days.
Tell me now.
Can't it go to any office?
Not yet.
Wire it to the Western Union in Oklahoma City,
Do you love me?
But we're hungry -- and I have to pick up my costume for the pageant! It starts at seven!
The timing was off -- I need this light.
Lunch time Sleeping Beauty. Where's Ben? Is he in the bathroom?
It's only one o'clock...Why don't you get another Fudgesicle -- I'll be done soon -- really soon.
But I want to. I'm trying!
That's me, Clifford.
I can certainly think of one more!
HE'S STILL ALIVE, EDNA!
Did you?
You coming back?
What you going to do?
You're serious.
Anyway, he offered me a silver cloud. At least he should give me a Ferrari and pay off my house and give me a nine carat ring or something...
George...
Wow.
Oh, yes, yes. They're below, waiting for the Princess ... I'm ready.
Oh, now he's adorable.
I'm not supposed to talk to strangers, not even nuns.
You have children?
Rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what Anna was thinking.
But why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared.
But you don't understand. She'll always be there -- at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.
Oh, Viktor. You say that now -- because we're here, alone, like this. But in the morning, you'd go back to her. What man wouldn't?
That's sweet, Viktor, but I couldn't let you do that -- make that kind of sacrifice. It's strange. I've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where I am -- it goes with the territory -- but, for some reason, I can't betray Simone. There's... I don't know any other way to say it -- there's a goodness to her.
This is crazy. Who am I fooling? I can't compete with Simone. What woman can?
Of course she will. Her public will demand it.
Please, Sidney, I can't stand this -
I could almost forgive you if what you did to Steve came from jealousy and love...
No, I did not.
Hold on, hold on, hold on:
...they sound what?
Why?
...you want us to go to War...
...but...
You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage?
Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip.
He was summoned to help correct a minor discrepancy of some sort in the Medical Records Division. Apparently one of his claims was relevant.
Right. In Omaha the driver will put you on the bus for Salt Lake City and the new driver will take... ...this part. When you get to Salt Lake City, ask the driver, 'Las Vegas, please'...
Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English.
The driver will...
Say it.
That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
...Fine.
I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink. And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.
When did you decide all this?
How? How were we the same people?
I don't know.
I might.
Yeah...
...You called me this morning.
Why didn't you get into bed?
...What?
Like I said, all this for some twisted, distorted sense of principal. Dunwitty, he just tolerates your Negroidal ass, he doesn't respect it.
No. I was just... No.
Day work.
What's that?
No, really..believe me - there isn't any more. This is it.
I wanta see Nathan.
-- Jackie really shouldn't drink --
Oh, no, really, I --
Stop him, Alex. You've got to stop him.
Potential? I don't understand.
It's not like he's a young man. He's had time to live.
Just a second, I've gotta clean this mess up or the dogs'll have it all over the house.
What the hell did you do that for? What are you doing here?
Does he--you know--like "me"?
Who's that?
Those are my friends.
Hunh.
Can we do any better?
Six years.
How do you hold down a job? It's 8:10. You were supposed to be here at 7:00. She's missed her sunrise Groom'n Ride.
I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
As a three-dollar bill.
Hunh.
That's not how he tells it.
I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry.
I've moved on.
You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig?
My father's never done a thing for any of them.
Oh.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
I'm going to take you to Margo...
Oh, no...
You see the play? You've seen the play every performance? But, don't you find it - I mean apart from everything else - don't you find it expensive?
Standing room doesn't cost much. I manage.
There isn't another like you, there couldn't be-
But if I'd known... maybe some other time... I mean, looking like this.
She's got to meet you-
No, I'd be imposing on her, I'd be just another tongue-tied gushing fan...
You look just fine... ... by the way. What's your name?
Eve. Eve Harrington.
Toss us out on our ass.
But it's a small room, Jason.
Lloyd, give it up.
The singer?
That song by Kris Kristofferson, where it's said "Like a pusher, party truth, partly fiction, a walking contradiction".
You must be rich.
You know what you remind me of?
No.
I do not wish to be scrogged--ever. I never heard that word, but when I heard it, I knew it was one thing I never wanted to have happen to me.
This is not a coy deception. I do not want to be scrogged. I want love. I want tenderness.
I will not be scrogged. I remember one time I saw you wrench a hook from the throat of a fish with a pair of pliers, and you promised me that the fish couldn't feel.
I'd like to have the expert opinion of the fish--along with yours.
Someone's got that job. Agent Orange! I came up with that one. Anyway, there are endless color possibilities and I'd be great at it.
I think you're right. So come on, I came all the way over here to find out what got Ann so spooked, tell me what happened.
Blue ruin is cheap gin in case you were wondering.
Exactly! Tom Waits. Which song?
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names. Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution. That'd be a job, coming up with those names. How do you get a job like that? That's what I'll do. Fuck the dole.
Purple Haze, Pink Eraser.
I thought you couldn't get your car.
This is a photo of hair.
Well, it's the same woman. And he was crazy about her. What is this? This is from Seattle.
Becky?
So I mailed your letter.
It's a sign --
It's a sign I've watched this movie too many times. I'm so stupid. From the minute I listen to that stupid program on the radio, I've been a complete jerk.
"Dear Annie: Thanks for your letter. It was great. We're very excited about meeting you in New York on Valentine's Day and seeing if we are M.F.E.O. Sleepless in Seattle."
M.F.E.O.?
Won't you be late for work?
Yeah.
What?
In that case you can do it. You were quite happy to do a lot more last night.
Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes. What's your air situation? Over.
Show us where you are, Chief.
I'm educating myself!
You're failing English . . . you used to be top of the class- PAULINE I'm doing my own writing!
What do you know? You wouldn't know the first thing about writing. You're the most ignorant person I've ever met!
is very angry.
Brother and sister no more.
A seven.
If you ask me, this is pretty stupid.
Save it for your wife.
I wear a seven.
Tell me somethin'. Is this my vacation or isn't it? I mean, God, you're as bad as Darryl.
I just haven't seen you like this in a while. I'm used to seeing you more sedate.
Well, I've had it up to my ass with sedate! You said you and me was gonna get outta town and, for once, just really let our hair down. Well, darlin,' look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!
Alright... I changed my mind. I'll have a margarita with and a shot of Cuervo on the side, please.
Thelma!
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas, Rudy.
Who wouldn't.
You shouldn't have.
Get out...
Just a minute, Mister McMurphy!
Please understand, the schedule has been set up for a delicately balanced reason that would be thrown into turmoil by a switch of routines.
Anxiety.
Go on...
We flopped the first time out.
Do you own any colored underwear? Stripes? Anything?!
Last I heard he went to San Diego.
Tod might know.
Are you a private detective?
You're not a film producer, are you?
Here? What a joke. There was some detective asking about that girl.
No, Evan. I don't know. It's been a long time. Fill me in.
God, Evan! I never thought I'd see you again. How've you been?
God, Mickey's such a hypochondriac. I wonder how he'd handle it if there was ever anything really wrong with him?
He was, he's just as crazy as ever. He was on his way to get a blood test.
Oh, yeah?
...ex-husband on the street the other day.
I bumped into your...
Get away!
I thought you arrested me.
Cut it out, Sam.
Um... Juno, can I -- Can I touch it?
Are you kidding? Everyone at school is always grabbing at my belly. I'm like a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.
Oh my God -- It moved! I felt it!
Elbow.
Well, if she's got any sense at all, she'll listen to that.
What is that?
What a night.
God, if Chet found out he'd...
Knox, if you promise that this will be the end of it-
Can't you see they want to start a fight so that they can lock you all up at one time?
About two-thirty.
What rehearsal dinner?
I told Walter.
Did you hear about this Bordeaux tasting dinner down in Santa Barbara Saturday night? It's a little pricey, but if you wanted to go, I'd be into it. Why don't you stay through the weekend?
Were you ever going to say anything?
Wonderful!
Mr. Masry, Mario gets lost going to the bathroom. They'll be driving around the valley for hours.
At home alone - where were you?
You do?
And what happened?
Well what do you know! An air conditioner.
You're touchy, Sidney - don't be so touchy...
Do you still keep your key under the mat?
Not to me. Sometimes, the world feels like a cage. Then someone comes along and opens the door...and it's never Monday night again... I wish you and Steve could like each other.
Whom are you calling--in the dead of night?
I'm sure.
I'm pregnant.
Well then. I'd better show you. Terry --
Walter just got it back from the framer today.
What is it?
I think Walter would find this a little more than surprising.
What is it?
Great saints!
B.F.D. What do you plan to do? Fly to Kansas and woo little Dorothy.
Oh but diddling the therapist's daughter is a challenge?
Jesus Christ, is she for real?
Oh, great.
Thank you.
They don't come better. But I don't deny there are times I wonder about things I won't have. Maybe one day I'll get to see Egypt. Maybe not. But I know if you try too many different lives, you can wind up with no life at all...
Sounds like something Tom would say.
You don't seem to upset?
Delayed shock. Or maybe not. I know I could talk my way back if I wanted or... go to another magazine, someplace... Just not sure if I want to.
Guess you don't have to figure it out until you go home.
Did you always know this was the life you wanted?
I fell in love. After that, I never thought about being anything but a rancher's wife. I never saw it like I was losing some other life, just felt like I was gaining one. I know that's not a popular opinion nowadays and I ain't saying it's the right one. We all have to find the life meant for us.
Frank's a good man.
No. We're not stayin' --
The trek out to the hospital every day didn t help either... You were great. Surviving the heart attack was one thing...
What if it's a Valloro 69? Just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.
I'm not conscious of having given you any meaningful looks. And as for the day after tomorrow, this is the day after tomorrow, and I am, unfortunately, seeing you... Now if you'll excuse me, I'd like to take a bath.
What?!
And far too aggressive.
That's not food. Can't be food.
It's a week. We didn't know where you were - or if you coming back, or -
I thought that was for when we were very very old?
Where've you been?
I could help you. I could get you off that.
Then I fixed supper for my husband and waited until --
There isn't any.
I haven't won it yet. I notice you've got me scheduled on a flight back an hour after the ceremony.
You... you... YOU --
How's it going chef?
Is this mine?
I feel like a princess.
When??
Just fine. It's a lovely party.
Peter-
The scent won't last...
But Claire--
I'll take that.
How much are your rooms?
You have one with two beds?
That was beautiful.
Yes. Sing some more.
Why, yes. This is amazing.
A boy?
And "Frank?"
Pop doesn't like people smoking in here.
The names of the members of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra since 1934 together with their questionnaires. Major, what am I to tell Dr. Furtw ngler?
Well...
He told me he didn't want to leave me with regret. Now that's all I have.
It's okay.
Doing what?
You still in school?
That's my father. I got to run.
Yeah. I don't see a way out of it.
Jesus, Lenny.
Sure, Lenny. The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love.
Guy named Wade Beemer. Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and '97.
What for? I can say anything I want with my eyes.
I wrote that with my heart.
Who? I'd have to have somebody I can trust. When were you born -- I mean, what sign of the zodiac?
Where's Gilbert?
But then how can you...
But if I don't plug it in how can I...
This feels stupid.
You're sick, Deckard.
Oh. Well, they're just a wonderful couple, we've been friends for years. We visit their island quite often.
Did you lose something?
Mickey?
Pardon me, was that Mr. Chance?
Oh... Mr. Gardiner... Mr. Chauncey Gardiner... You're not related to Basil and Perdita Gardiner are you?
Oh, by the way - I'm Eve Rand.
May I ask your name?
Maybe the problem is your kids. Maybe they're spoiled, coddled brats!
Catch me letting you go alone!
You have to sign for it.
I'm gonna be your typist for this evening.
"Room Service!"
But we...
And here's some hydrogen peroxide.
Talk to me.
In Mr. Sampson's office.
What about "60 Minutes."
Let go! We've got to stop!
And Caesar! Let's not forget to serve Caesar!
Except for that, quite like home; England, that is.
Landon, honey. There's nothing more.
I have to get dressed. My ex-husband has asked me to dinner. God knows why, he was very mysteri...
Why would his worry? Or my children's worry. Or anyone's worry. Help the sit...
I begged him. Don't see why he had to go...
Jes? Jesse? Oh shit... Wait... Wait... STOP!
I got others.
I wish my funbags would get bigger.
Almost eight. You wouldn't believe how weird I look naked.
Hot!
Trust me, you don't. I actually have to wear a bra now. And I have to rub this nasty cocoa butter stuff all over myself or my skin could get stretched too far and explode.
Okay, stop surfing porn and get back to work. Just wanted to say hi.
God, you're getting huge. How many months has it been now?
Well--
Well, you are kind of... convex.
God, why is everyone always staring at me?
Just like it.
I'm sorry.
Buddy, sex don't mean a thing to me. It ain't nothin' but a mosquito bite. I'll tell you a secret. Girls don't want sex, Buddy, girls want love.
A saint just like your own mother. She's up in heaven right now, her and Lunette, there ain't no doubt about it.
Boy did I get sick of rabbit. But later on after Momma died and Daddy wasn't doin' nothin' but drinkin', I sure would of been glad for a little rabbit stew. You know, I oughtn't to of told you about what Daddy done when I was a child. Until them rabbits ruined him, he was a real good man, Buddy.
He thought he could sell 'em, but nobody but country folks eat rabbits, Buddy, and they ain't got no money. We had to eat them dern rabbits our own selves. Every dern one, and it took about four years to eat 'em all up.
Now are you going to get a regular job?
Yeah, thanks.
Do you want to do something tonight?
Don't worry.
I can't, it's Seymour's birthday... Shit! What time is it? I have to go to the store! I was going to make him a cake...
Well, are we still going shopping tomorrow?
Well tell me, papa. What was it like making love?
How do I look?
You want me to be your daughter forever, don't you?
A beautiful child! Is that what you still think I am?
No, he can't.
Yes.
Wow, I guess I hit a nerve.
You want to play "Cora." You want me to tell Lloyd I think you should play it.
If you told him so, he'd give me the part. He said he would.
Give yourself time. Don't worry too much about what people think, you're very young and very talented... ... and, believe it or not, if there's anything I can do-
Why?
I think I know...
Something most important you can do.
Eve. I - I don't think you meant to cause unhappiness. But you did. More to yourself, perhaps - as it turned out - than to anyone else...
I'll never get over it.
Yes, you will. You Theater people always do. Nothing is forever in the Theater. Love or hate, success or failure - whatever it is, it's here, it flares up and burns hot - and then it's gone.
I wish I could believe that.
Matthew.
Yes, someone did. But it wasn't me, Norman. It was you. You manifested the snakes.
I want your feelings about it.
Is she all right?
So where is your roommate, the model?
No deals! Just information. Information. Free of charge. No strings. Just information.
Wait!
He flings open the door and launches himself at the bed, ravishing her!
No, No, this one didn't escape. You told me you'd always been in Hell. You were wrong. Look at it. LOOK. IT'S YOU.
Help me.
I know about your fucking condition, Leonard! I probably know more about it than you do! You don't have a fucking clue about anything else!
What happened is that Jimmy went to meet a guy called Teddy. He took a lot of money with him and he didn't come back. Jimmy's partners think I set him up. I don't know whether you know this Teddy or how well -
Don't protect him.
Epilepsy.
It's gonna be fine. These people are ready for anything.
Not exactly. They decided gambling and dancing were bad for people. Can I make it?
It is you, isn't it, Harold?
It's a call back service -- a girl will call you back.
Actually, Mr. Rieper . . . it's a novel, and we'll be sending it to New York. That's where all the big publishing houses are based.
Then why stay in the hills.
I like it.
Okay, have we gone over everything? Back on Tuesday, right?
Yes. In the church at Domremy.
That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
I quit two days ago, Brian.
I don't have the slightest idea...
It's a small town.
Well, maybe I'd like to know just once!
Niagara Falls! Walter, you don't mean that?
Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
I'm engaged.
You don't even know me.
Walter!
In that order?
What's the title?
Snap out of it!
It's just the strain again, the stress. We'll take a vacation.
Cole, it'll be all right. Honey?
Oh, Cole, please. Please come out of it. What would I do without you?
I'm feeling okay--
Sergeant?
Yes, Sergeant.
You're testing me?
Until it happens, you're still a human being.
Maybe that's my problem.
I know it is. Right after my parents died, I went to the beach... I was in the water. Everything was calm. And then one of those really big waves hit me. Hard. Pulled me straight to the bottom. I struggled and finally ran out of air. If it hadn't been for my sister who pulled me out, I would've drowned. Legally dead for a couple of minutes is what they told me.
I was desperate. I knew you wrote about murders. I needed a way in.
I do. Yes.
That's not my handwriting.
Yes, I, yes, I signed it, yes. But I, I didn't write that figure.
Because I kept a copy. I have it right here.
She knew what she was signing on for After all, she took the money.
Calm down, Benjamin.
What?
You hear that?
Thank you.
Which way do you want to go?
Why are you doing this to me? I'll give you whatever...
The biggest waste of time since television.
To shave your chest?
Would you stop being ridiculous? Your father wants Sam home as much as I do.
Adam, that's not true!
I know a lot of men who didn't do anything till they met Walter Burns. Please, dear.
Which they did, and every once in a while on a commercial, you can hear me scream.
You're so sweet.
Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere?
I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you.
Well, you run on now.
Yes, Ma'am.
Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here.
Hello.
What?
Oh, Jesus.
What's this?
No, no, no.
Maybe I better start our homework.
Good luck.
Oh my God. I can't tell you how nervous I've been. I couldn't sleep last night.
What?
Tim Kobza? Tim Kobza! Who's he? I've never heard of him!
No. Never. You'll have to kill me.
I-I'm not sure... yeah, maybe.
Are you going to yell at me?
But how are you gonna pay rent and everything? You don't even have a job.
I'll get a job tomorrow, I promise. If I don't, you can totally tell me to fuck off.
I was in a horrible mood - tell her not to worry, I'll be completely out of her life in a few days.
Don't... talk crazy.
Mama...?
Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
I don't care, Dad. I love you.
I'm back, Mama.
Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
But I want to talk to you. Mommy says for you to come up to the old house with me. I've got to take back this ring.
I couldn't it was Johnny Horne's birthday. I promised I'd be with him. I told you not to call me here.
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?
I'm okay. But it's nice to be home.
Wait, I was going to tell you--
I want to do it.
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley.
Where have you been?
Yes...
But Humpty Dumpty was alone.
He doesn't want to meet some out-of- work ingenue.
The fact is, I have to get going.
Is what true?
Yes.
Chauncey, where have you been? I was afraid you got bored and left, or that you were with some mysterious woman.
He doesn't go back to the mill, he gets a second chance to go back to the firehouse...
Wait wait wait wait wait he gets a second chance, do you see? And you get a second chance!
It's so great to see you like this, honey... I can't tell you.
Me?
And it's hard to get.
No. The kind from Kraft, with the macaroni and the cheese.
Mmm, needs a little something.
We have common foes, Chauncey - kid lawyers and our physician!
... Oh? Robert, take a look, would you?
Chauncey, I wanted to tell you how dreadful I feel about the accident today, but that I'm delighted that you are staying with us.
... And Ben is just mad about you - you've lifted his spirits so - it's just... Well, it's just a real pleasure having you with us.
What?
Who is the kid?
The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly.
Nails? Really?
No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno?
They say they're going to pay my medical expenses and everything. I promise this will all be resolved in thirty-odd weeks, and we can pretend it never happened.
You're pregnant?
I'm so sorry, you guys. If it's any consolation, I have heartburn that's like, radiating down to my kneecaps and I haven't gone number two since Wednesday. Morning!
What... ?
They'll go on early. Nobody will even be there yet and I told them they can't play for more than a half hour.
Alright, Pony!
Escape hatch.
Not properly watered.
It was a nine millimeter.
Wait a minute. I've got to ask myself.
But when did he go? How do you know?
I never knew my mother. My father died when I was nine.
Yes. Very much.
I don't know a loud crash.
Ollie.
It's your play.
I had my breakfast while you were still asleep.
Edward will give you your breakfast, Amy.
Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me.
Agnes? Who? Mother Superior?
What?
As much as Mother Miriam does?
I really love you.
Sister...
No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age!
None in sight, there aren't many along this back road...
Any houses or farms around where we can borrow gas?
Three or four miles...
How far to the station?
You'll break your neck on that ice.
Not many car either, not much chance of a lift...
How fortunate that I have an understudy so ready, so willing and so able to go on.
Don't joke about such things.
Would you like me to leave...? Is this a bad time --?
Is this a bad time.
Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
...and is that serious?
I wouldn't have come if I had known that you were here. Believe me, Rick, it's true. I didn't know.
Please.
No. No, Rick. Not tonight.
That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
You could've killed him, you know. You could've killed the Joker.
If there was one.
Never mind.
They don't know?
Oh, Ben -- this is so -- exciting --
What's happening?
I don't believe it.
Hello.
stands and picks up her handbag. Pauline stands and Juliet grabs her hand.
Maybe... I don't know... but first we have to confess...
But we have to question him -- Thought you didn't have cigarettes --
Good. Can you bring me to him?
So who gave the order to bring me to this side of the river??
Is that unusual?
No, I think I'd remember.
Jasper Lamar Crabb?
And Hollis knew about it?
It means shut up, Thelma.
You know... they'd probably ask to see your driver's license before they hired you.
I'm sorry. I wasn't listening.
And I love you, Pete!
The FBI, and the CIA, and J. Edgar Hoover and oil companies and the Pentagon and the men's-room attendant at the White House?
Stop it! Don't... don't do that! There.
Alvy, now don't panic. Please.
You scared me.
I'm fine.
Guess he talked to you.
That's just a little promotion scheme. Nobody expects you - Mike, will you try and get Mr. Leland some coffee?
I'll tell you what I'll do, Brad - I'll get drunk, too - maybe that'll help.
Why, Brad?
All right.
You've passed me on the street almost every day.
Hello. You look at me as if you didn't know me.
I can't do that.
It's not my body I want to save. It's my soul.
Not with my mouth open.
Good girl.
You wouldn't kiss him, huh?
You have to ignore him.
He's not even there. You don't see him, you don't hear him, you're just too much of a woman to bother with little boys.
And what do you do wh...
I call him a fartface or a pervert, or something equally lame.
This is a joke, right?
From pursuing your chosen profession.
Please. Now I've forgotten how many spades are out.
Yeah?
Frankie, Johnny wants to say goodnight.
A Broadway shopping bag.
Do what, Mr Lombard?
Yesterday. It all looked normal.
The truth is always simple... it's you, Jean, who's making things complicated.
All you have to do is stop talking and just listen.
And why would that scare me?
You don't know the first thing about being someone's friend --
You don't know what you want --
What's this all about?
Maybe...
No!
No. This really pissed him off, Sonny. He says you're dead. He says he doesn't have a son.
Yes. How did...
So what's going on?
There are fucking coyotes out there.
I'm so sorry.
She left the fucking gate open.
Can't have gone far? He's like a greyhound. He could be miles away.
What are you talking about?
That's who people want to rent to. It's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... All we have to do is buy a few semi-expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.
You just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.
Just promise you'll do it.
Okay, okay, I promise... Jesus, you're out of your mind.
Nope. What are you making, pancakes?
What? How long have you been standing there?
You... you mean... English Bob killed him while...?
Fuck you!
I wouldn't say that. I expect she's right, ultimately. But I'm with Delores when it comes to fighting for what's mine. I can't understand why Delores is so uptight about the Chink; he could probably teach her a thing or two. Ee! That grass tickles, doesn't it? God knows I love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits. Still this is cowgirl territory and I'll stand with Delores and fight any bastards who might deny it. I guess I've always been a scrapper. Look. This scar. Only twelve years old and I was felled by a silver bullet.
What is Debbie's position?
......Delores zonks out on peyote at least once a week, but so far her Third Vision hasn't happened. Niwet kame, the Mother Goddess has not gotten back in touch with her. Meanwhile she and Debbie are rivaling each other like a couple of crosstown high schools. Tension. Cowgirl tension! What a drag.
You don't agree with Debbie, then?
Debbie says that if women are to take charge again, they must do it in the feminine way; they mustn't resort to aggressive and violent masculine methods. She says it is up to women to show themselves better than men, to love men, set good examples for them and guide them tenderly toward the New Age. She's a real dreamer, that Debbie-dear.
Seriously.
You can't just stay in your house.
Yeah but I'm serious.
I'll see you there.
Don't puss out.
Aren't you supposed to keep them?
I thought you were supposed to keep them.
Thanks for everything.
I can't wait to start campaigning.
Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
On that pathetic fake blind date.
Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
I'd make a fucking good mother! I love children! I'm creative and smart and I'd make a fucking good mother!
It's you! It's you who can't commit to anything! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you! I don't even know why I am! I should just end it right here, Joel. Leave you in the zoo. Maybe you could find a nice sloth to hang out with!
Would you get me another, Joely?
Holy shit!
Are you wasted?
Just about anything, you know. It can be funny or... not. Just tell me somethin'.
I think it'd be better if you talk to me.
Holy shit, Ronnie! You're a fuckin' rock star.
A little.
Not one of Steven's finer moments.
I think I remember.
It would be nice.
Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.
Well, I'm not ready to be a mom.
Once! And she didn't die, if you recall!
Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking!
No.
First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver.
Cool it.
The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"?
Not loving enough. That is a terrible thing to do to someone. I suppose I did it to Clive. Always held something back.
You were never apart, you and Clive. He kept asking and asking. And I waited and waited for you to say something. And you never did.
Mac, did you ever find out who Molly went off with?
He could always make me laugh.
No, of course, you don't want to talk about it.
Evening, Cal. Would you tell me about it?
No, of course, you want to get out of town.
There's a young girl to see you.
I don't know.
What're you goin' to do?
You just can't stand to miss one of them, can you?
Keymaster?
What did that man mean when he said you were... .?
No! NO! Don't touch me!
Everybody loved Joey. From the little kids to the old rummies. Did you know him very well?
Will you unzip my dress?
Benjamin?
Won't you unzip my dress?
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you --
On yeah? I went to Holy Name. Where'd you go to high school?
We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant. It was most agreeable.
Okay Mr Inventor, how do we avoid it ?
What'd you find, Kathy?
Jacques...?
Oh Gawd, oh yes, it's never been better. Never BETTER!!
You are not having your baby in London. You're going to have your baby at Cedars in Beverly Hills, America, delivered by Dr. Milton Cohen. Period. And you're getting that epidural right away, don't let anyone talk you into any of that Lamase bullshit. There's no excuse for pain like that.
No, you didn't say that, Brother.
That's stupid.
Oh, Mother shut up! Don't you understand? The water is freezing and there aren't enough boats... not enough by half. Half the people on this ship are going to die.
Jerry, this is what intimacy is!
You got the wrong girl, Sam.
You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know?
You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't.
I'm embarrassed. The list is so long.
I'm talking about you.
There's something wrong with this picture.
You had another one, didn't you? You have to see a doctor, Grady. First thing Monday morning. All right?
Most natural thing in the world!
You know each other?
Now, if you're ready, Senator, we can start for the hotel. I'll see that you get there.
Almost. Want to sit up? What's the matter?
I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime.
Marriage is happy news.
Okay.
...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years.
What's up?
That's right. I don't want them breathing down my neck while we're in London.
Where's Clifford?
Oh.
I know.
You don't think I'm good enough?
Burn it to a fine ash.
It's terrific Win.
They've got two monsters now. Both boys.
It's called "solid"... Nice to find someone you can count on, Win.
You didn't like him?
Eighteen and a half years.
I'm sorry Sam couldn't make it.
There could be problems with something like that Mister Wallace. What if...?
I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that.
No, I don't suppose it has. He was broken up like nobody's business in that hospital when he found out Louisa was dead.
Rose, this is Waski. His real name is Warren but we call him Waski. He doesn't like it much and I suppose someday we'll have to stop calling him that.
But Rache...
The guy I see is in the eighth grade at Prep School, and he laughs his ass off every time we talk about you.
He'll be impressed. The clincher is, you walk away, then whip around...
In high school.
Oh. It's an incredibly disgusting, and not remotely sexy thing, that they described in a movie I'd never let you go to. But it's real. Does he have an older brother?
Uh. What is it?
Killing himself.
Whatever you like.
A suitable boy, will be at this flagpole, on Monday, with a very expensive bike, and he will be a stone FOX if I have to call an escort service!
I called and called but you were out. I thought I'd be gone before you got back.
There are plenty of girls who would give thousands of dollars to have your auburn hair. Beauty is beauty and that's all there is to it. Beauty is there and we have to recognize it. Now Rose, the little girl sitting across from you with the blue eyes is Doll Baby. She looks like an angel and she is an angel, but she can be a naughty angel sometimes, although her father won't believe it. Her real name is Frances, but we call her Dolly or Doll.
Look it, mister... you wanna have your way, you take it. I'll do whatever you want. But you gotta let me go. You can't do this! You can't KEEP ME HERE!
Forget what?
My daughter. I haven't been on a bike for years. When was the last time you rode a bike?
The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses.
No - really, I can see them -- they're coming now - turn off the lights
It's all right. I'm not hurt.
This kind of thing must happen to him all the time.
This is way too creepy.
I know... wouldn't you be totally pissed off?
He doesn't even look that bummed out, really.
I'm afraid if I see him, I'll start feeling really bad again.
He won't see us... we'll just stalk him from a distance.
Here we go again.
He's retarded's all. You know he's always after a father figure and Lord knows Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.
I don't feel anything.
Look at this! The dog! She's dead!
I know.
Frank told me about your situation. And Frank loves company. You know, especially after his daddy passed and all. There ain't no sense in you stayin' in that old greasy shop. He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
Frank's just crazy about him. He likes the way he talks. He helped him carry home the clean laundry.
You might say that, although I don't think of it as traveling.
Well, no, I don't reside anywhere in particular. I just keep moving.
I don't.
If I don't answer, he'll know something's up.
I just thought ... It's beautiful.
I'm sorry ...
I think it looks nice.
I'm going to get started on dishes.
I'll help you.
David, come back here!
Yes...Look, during the last five years we were married, I had...I was getting more and more...unhappy, more and more frustrated. I needed to talk to somebody. I needed to find out if it was me, if I was going crazy or what. But every time I turned to Ted--my ex-husband, he couldn't handle it. He became very...I don't know, very threatened. I mean, when- ever I would bring up anything he would act like it was some kind of personal attack. Anyway, we became more and more separate ...more and more isolated from one another. Finally, I had no other choice, I had to leave. And because of my ex-husband's attitude--his unwillingness to deal with my feelings, I had come to have almost no self- esteem... At the time I left, I sincerely believed that there was something wrong with me--that my son would be better off without me. It was only when I got to California and started into therapy I began to realize I wasn't a terrible person. And that just because I needed some creative and emotional outlet other than my child, that didn't make me unfit to be a mother.
I make thirty-one thousand dollars a year.
I don't hear anything. You were dreaming. Or maybe the wind blew something over.
Can't you answer? What's the matter with you anyhow?
Was it Sister Marguerite?
What would you like to talk about.
Really, Frank? When was that?
God! But there's nothing to say about God.
First thing that comes to your mind?
I was talking to Jim.
Did you see what Mr Carroll wrote in my yearbook? Well, he ridiculed me all year long, and then he writes, "You're a real live-wire, Love Mr Carroll." Y'know, it's all so phoney.
Was this during Betty?
No one put me up to anything. I was just hoping I could ask you a couple questions.
I hear some surfer pulled a knife on Mr. Hand this morning.
I'm just not the type. Besides, I want to get out of here.
What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
I'm sorry, I had to get dressed.
How could I? I was sleeping.
And you admire that?
I don't know...
You never dated Kathy Reynolds!
I never knew that.
What gets me is I'm 46 years old. I've been in this crummy fucking marriage -
He shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.
No. I mean. I don't know. What else do you know about him?
We were like sisters. Knew everything about each other.
I couldn't believe it either...
I knew it. 'Cause we wouldn't have heard anything if it was him. He's real careful. Fact is, he's anal.
I could've sworn I heard something.
Yeah, he told me once himself. He said to me...
Don't talk -- eat -- we want to get you well quick as we can so we can all get out of here.
Drink this and stop being silly. Why would anyone want to live in this place. You might as well be dead and buried. Nothing to do but look at mountains. In a week you'd be talking to yourself. Maybe that's what got you started in the first place.
He won't take us. Don't you want us around?
It's for my complexion.
If you're worried about Mary and me talkin' too much, don't. No matter how many questions your old man asks. We know how to keep our mouths shut.
Not if I know Mary. When she rides into Sonora, you'll be with her. And mighty glad to be there after this. I don't see how you stood it as long as you did.
You've got a beautiful life. And even with this, it's always been clear that he loves you. I've come to think that's all that really matters.
Would you like some iced tea?
Don't just waltz in here dressed like that and order a beer.
Grouchy?
No.
Paxcow says it's almost too late!
No thanks.
Do you swear?
That poor girl is in a tough spot.
Ellie...Ellie...what...
Paxcow says it's almost too late! We have to go back! Paxcow says it's almost too late!
It's beautiful. What's it about?
Arabic?
This is - what is this?
Are you gonna tell me where you went?
So am I.
I'll be upstairs...if you want to play.
Oh... chamber runs. Uh huh, that's good. Well, hey... you guys know any songs?
Why not?
Like a Grateful Dead Concert.
No, you can't, they have enough kids, you'll have to live with the Partridge Family.
California, I'm going to Hollywood to live with the Brady Bunch.
And then you weren't there.
It's fucking freezing out here.
What? Gimme a fucking break. Is that what you think? That your not big enough a deal for me? Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.
No.
What were the others?
We just do it...we do it and we figure it out and we do as we do, I guess...
Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
Well, not monumentally.
Drop some money.
Do it. Right here. On the ground.
No. Follow him.
He won't.
Wait.
What are we going to do?! What are we going to use for money?!
Yes...
It's vile.
I never said that!
Which is ridiculous. Boats are female, everyone knows you can't call a boat after a man.
Relax, kid. It's only me and my big mouth...
It's just that you get me so mad sometimes... of all the women in the world with nothing to complain about-
The critics thought so, the audiences certainly think so - packed houses, tickets for months in advance - I can't see that either of Lloyd's last two plays have hurt you any!
I find these wisecracks increasingly less funny! 'Aged in Wood' happens to be a fine and distinguished play-
I know. She just keeps hearin' her dead father play the banjo.
It's the tight girdle that does it.
Well. I guess a real tight girdle help when you're playin' a lunatic.
Margo does not play a lunatic, Birdie.
Unbelievably handsome. You look fantastic in a suit.
I'm sorry. I'm not sure how this works. I have to go out... is that all right?
I have to pick something up before Bergdorf's closes, then stop at a reception just a few blocks away.
Lieutenant Garber said that in all likelihood there was no real danger, is that true?
Uh ...
Huh?
Forget your tie, handsome ... Frank!
I'm fine.
We didn't hit it off.
He thought so, yes.
Thank you.
Can I go now?
grabs Pauline by the shoulders.
I had a nasty foreboding feeling at first, but now I realise my crime was too frightful for an ordinary lecture.
From now on, you're sleeping in the house, where we can keep an eye on you.
If you think for one minute that your father and I will tolerate this sort of behaviour, you've got another thing coming! You're only 14!!! You're a child! What on earth's the matter with you, Yvonne? You know what can happen with boys . . . Don't you have any self-respect?
sighs.
I don't want your mother to believe something like this but what am I to think?
You should have thought about that before you brought that woman in here!
Nevermind.
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.
...but the President wonders about the Possible Albanian Backlash...
Don't leave a girl hanging. Second rule of show business.
When?
So?
He's got a standing invitation.
You're so nice to let Sam use your shower.
Don't you know?
Agnes, how are babies born?
Yes. I've seen your victims. One past and one future. I thought I might convince you to reconsider.
Wait. He left.
Where's Ronnie?
Then I better be on my way. Don't wanna put you out no more.
I don't got any money... for fixin' me up and all.
Naw'sir... I gotta be on my way.
Would you like to ask them?
Beth's boyfriend is playing in the band.
Thanks, Daddy. But I just need one. Mother's not going.
If I don't speak to Mr. Shermin, I'm hanging up.
Stunning, Viktor. The Hollywood Foreign Press is going to eat this up.
Of course. This afternoon.
-me, my God, it's a great day!
Yeah.
Well, well!
Whadaya mean-- right ?
Go away, Nosey.
To not do that. To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
Ok. I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
You wanna make a deal with me?
What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
Look, Nosey--your pals would like to get in on this, wouldn't they?
But thanks.
Hi. It's Maya. Please leave a message.
What are you doing?
A lifetime of petty crime climaxed by your sleaziest accomplishment yet... blackmailing a national hero...
Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
Oh, yes!
Do you think he loves you?
Oh, I know he does.
Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
Yes.
Who?
Oh, there are so many.
He's told you?
No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
Well, you don't have to be so dramatic about it.
Ellie. Pulsar?
Dr. Cullers?
I'm serious about this, Peter --
You sonofabitch.
Well, what d'you think?
He's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.
What was?
You almost married recently, didn't you?
Thanks. No, I can handle it. Bud... there won't be enough to run the heaters. In a couple hours this place is going to be as cold as a meat locker.
Oh, flowers! I didn't know you were so traditional.
I went with Sandy and Vera. Salvy was there. Stop it. I just had a drink, that's all. I didn't do anything wrong.
Good morning, Mr. Treves. It'll be his bath-time soon. Has he eaten?
Won't come out, eh?
Go away.
Who?
Oh boy, that's another thing that's going to change. Who's going to think for us? Our husbands? You know, you treat Mom like a maid. It's not entirely your fault. Those were the attitudes in the fifties, and that's the way you raised me. But give Nancy a break, encourage her to go to art school.
I want to help with the family finances. I want you to buy some stocks. And gold. By 1980 gold is going to be worth eight hundred dollars an ounce. Then you sell.
Am I a cursed woman, Doctor? Must I be betrayed by every man I meet --
Now.
Did you hear me?
He wants me to come to his quarters.
I have to... he's a G-34
Is the trial date set?
Oh God. He's back. I'm sorry. Please forget that I...I don't know what I'm saying. Please...
The monkey.
Would you check in on Elijah? He seems to be a little under the weather this morning.
Why'd you do it, Craig?
What's going to happen?
Well, if you'd been here to begin with, I wouldn't have dared to read at all...
... and if you'd come in the middle, I'd have stopped, I couldn't have gone on-
You wouldn't understand. How was Miss Caswell?
I was dreadful, Miss Channing, believe me - I have no right to be anyone's understudy, much less yours...
Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
Fiction. We had a house on that coast and it never rained blood. Go on. More.
This is not very good, is it?
Shall we be all right?
Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her.
What'd you say, Brother?
What the hell do you think you're doing, making all that Goddamn noise?
Would you watch the damn road?
--when you go away.
He won't leave my room.
Will he talk to me?
No.
I want to speak to Marc Shermin.
Oh, wow... I'll tell you what. When the baby is born, we'll go out in my back yard and wave to you.
Oh, fabulous.
That's why it will be so much fun.
That was a mistake, but I don't regret it.
DeLa, you should try it sometime. Come into the light.
I can't lie to him. If he asks me something, I tell him what I think.
I guess it must.
Excuse me. What part of NO don't you understand?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. I said I'd drop you home, but I'm not taking you on your sleazoid rounds. I've already pulled twelve hours today.
Sleaze to peddle.
He whips you?
No sand. That's your drugs speaking.
Coffee and a donut.
Fine. Just gonna get the bowl for my thing.
Why do you want to do that?
All right... I didn't have lunch with Jennifer.
I'm not huggin' you in the middle of the street. You must be crazy, Julius.
Well you did.
You idiot. You almost gave me a massive coronary.
I envy you. That's the way I want to feel about my work.
Why do you say that? You've never seen me.
What did they say?
The US Army: Always an adventure.
Wyatt, I couldn't find a single Store that had laudanum any-
Oh, yes, Grandmama - I wait until I hear...
Sure. We could really use a farmer. We'd be grateful for the help. Also, I think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. You know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.
Tell them Pete. Tell them...
Fine, I just --
You really don't remember anything that happened?
I was at a cocktail party. Very trendy. Andrew was in Chicago on business. He had broken his wrist the week before and was wearing it in a sling. He looked so helpless.
That s right. Okay, let s make a quick stop at the kids shoe department, pick up my watch from the battery place, then I ll run into the linen store...
Stayed out? Daddy never went out at all.
They have a very large gay clientele, you know, where I get my teeth cleaned, and...all the hygienists now wear gloves because they're afraid of AIDS.
Yes, he's just adorable.
"Mankind is born free, but everywhere he is in chains..."
Well, I remember a philosopher who said something that I used to think was just another of those stupid class denouncements... but which I now see means us all.
You remember, George, when we were 'studying' the great philosophers?
Now that is a lie! See how much you want to create a scandal in exchange for a glowing reputation and polite society laid at your feet! When you break off your engagement to Martha Curtis, I'll divorce William! Do you hear? You get what you want from this world, then throw it all away on love!
Is it? William says now you have requested a British Commission, why not colonial? I'll clear it up for you, sir, because as a British officer you can lord over colonial yokels -- more than that, it will even get you into polite society! Your dream come true, George, the only dream that really matters to you.
Jesus.
And your wife? Where's she?
I didn't think so. I've fucked detectives. Who are you?
Of Joanne's?
Hey, don't worry about it. Your daughter's around. We'll find her in a couple days.
You can't hurt people... and then just say, I'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. Why would heaven want people like that. People who... do what they want and then... switch.
But that's so fuckin' stupid. I'm sorry. Didn't mean to curse.
They must've learned how to control water... I mean at a molecular level. They can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. Put it under intelligent control.
Jimmy Grantz. Know him?
You tell me.
Are you Teddy?
Can you see it?
Share the love, Tits!
Yum. This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!
Hly shht!
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.
What?
No way! She's pretty.
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?
What else can you do?
You know carpentry?
We had some lemonade and he left.
Who's dead?
Yeah.
Do you know where he went?
Who, Benny's little sister?
You know who that is, don't you? You really don't? That's Skip Skipperton, man. He gets himself hit by a truck, this whole town shuts down.
So, what makes you so popular? What's your secret?
Not sure. Let me think about it.
Father, I have sinned...
How would you like to have a baby, Duff?
What are you talking about? What kind of loser gets fired after one day?!
I told you - my manager was a total asshole! Don't worry, I'm going to get another job... and anyway, I have some ideas for how to make money in the meantime...
But I feel weird... it's so sleazy.
What? I'm just kidding around with the customers... It's my shtick!
In the water.
Knox, why are you doing this to me?
You're very easily amused.
I don't believe this. I don't bloody believe this.
No... no, excuse me Eve. As quickly as I see fit.
And the sooner she goes to prison, the better off she'll be?
Why?
I'm not much of a gambler really. I just like this bar.
That's stupid. What are the odds of you being seen with me?
To coincidence.
You know what? I'd like to buy you a drink.
But you did all you could, David. Not many little boys could've gone on such a journey as you did.
In this rat race, everybody's guilty till they're proved innocent! One of the differences between the Theater and civilization... ... what gets me is how all of those papers in town happened to catch that particular performance!
Lloyd says it's a publicity release...
It's new Margo. But she's just as late as the old one.
"... my hat which has, lo, these many seasons become more firmly rooted about my ears, is lifted to Miss Harrington. I am once more available for dancing in the streets and shouting from the housetops." ... I thought that one went out with Woollcott... Down here... here, listen to this- "... Miss Harrington had much to tell - and these columns shall report her faithfully - about the lamentable practice in our Theater of permitting, shall we say - mature - actresses to continue playing roles requiring a youth and vigor of which they retain but a dim memory-"
I just can't believe it.
It get better! "- About the understandable reluctance on the part of our entrenched First Ladies of the Stage to encourage, shall we say - younger - actresses; about Miss Harrington's own long and unsupported struggle for opportunity-"
I can't believe Eve said those things!
I want to look around, daddy-- may I?
Bite?
Are you hungry?
How am I going to explain this to Walter?
Oh, it's just Becky, she's having trouble with Rich again. Hold on, Becky, I'm going downstairs.
Turn on your radio!
Hello.
For him. It doesn't work for the rest of us.
Just be yourself.
Yes!
It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. What is it you want?
Search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. If they're hurt and we can get to them in time...
Sergeant West's served for twenty- three years. He's the public face of the modern Army.
...I..uh..I get to read some of the books but mostly I..just calculate production costs from first edition hard cover publication to paperback. After paperback it's basically someone else's problem.
Oh, no..I have to get home...
No really..I can't.
The nails!! Watch the nails!!... Listen, you still have to eat.
Those are white words, not ours.
I'm sorry. I didn't realize... But she knew, John. A mother knows what's in her son's heart.
Leave him alone! Come on, let's go.
I'd like to see you work.
You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends.
That's stupid. Why would they?
"War is not healthy for children and other living things." How lovely.
Oh no... Why? What is it? The way I look?
No, no, I don't think that, I'm just curious about it... Do you think I'm a freak?
Actually, it's very admirable, the way she works. She'll probably be enormously successful, because she's attractive as well, not that that's so important in music, but...
You're such a baby.
I'm in charge of the conversions. When First Bank buys another smaller bank, I'm in charge of converting them to our systems and way of doing things.
I... I .....
Doesn't anyone notice all the people missing ?
Your arm, you can't...
When this ship docks, I'm getting off with you.
Oh.	Ah...recently. All the kids drink it.
No... no... I'm just a messenger... He needs me... a higher calling...
Well what do you want to talk about?
Do you want to tell me about some of your college experiences?
Well?
How about art.
You start it off. I don't know anything about it.
Okay.
Oh great!
Yeah, you would.
Yeah, unhappy and fat. And I still find the meetings very comforting, you know.
Oh, God.
Don't let me get started on my childhood. Oh, you know what? There is a bookstore.
Yes. Like Bear and the Ansel twins and Sean and...
Hey. Do you have a cigarette?
What's it about?
Hey, you said you did a video?
What?
It bit you.
This wing configuration. I've never...
No, I'm not playing this game.
No!
Iram - marry Em - marry me! No, no! You're a fiend. I'm not going to marry a fiend. A dirty fiend at that.
Tub - but i-tub - but I vol - love but I love ui - You. I love you!
Sounds like your captain's going to get hell when he gets back home.
The police shouldn't have started shooting. But you can hardly blame them. You surprised them. They didn't know you were up there. When they saw you, they thought you were here to hurt us.
A friend is a person that is good to you... someone you like to be with... someone you like to laugh with...
Oh, that's terrible. I'm sorry. Was he a good friend?
The captain...
I thought a torn ACL was ten to twelve.
I put up new drapes, Jake.
I don't believe it.
They've been targeted. And Pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.
Oh, I'll be back before Christmas.
You throw mighty far, Jabez -- almost into the pigsty.
Forget it.
Thanks. We will. Goodbye.
Yes. I'll go. Yes.
And you're still trying to get me into bed.
I would say it sounds like you're trying to get me into bed.
That's right.
But not too ashamed.
I'm sorry. That was stupid of me. I didn't mean to be so rude.
Who is she?
All the men at court are without poetry. If they look at me they see my father's fortune. I will have poetry in my life. And adventure. And love. Love above all.
Yeah, no, I see --
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah?
You were talking about the promotion --
I get the point, kiddo. But I'm not so bad, am I?
I get off for lunch in ten minutes. Can I treat you to a hamburger?
I'd love to.
I know. I watched it. I sort of know it by heart.
Oh please. My need to make the best of things, and your need to be what, "responsible"... if one of us doesn't say something now we might lose ten years being polite about it. Why don't we call this next road trip what it is. A nice long break.
You take what people say and make it ugly. You make others believe what you want them to. She should have been found guilty. She shouldn't have gotten off.
They might be.
A bit too quick.
I... I'm sorry, Meurice. I gotta talk to you... Can I come in?
You broke into the bar. You wanted to get your money. You and Marty had a fight. Something happened...
...I don't know, wasn't it you? Maybe a burglar broke in, and you found--
NO!
Gabriel, you promised!
No.
About me?
Look, Mother!
looks down at the ground in front of her.
I shot him.
Huckleberry Hound! What, are you nuts?
But why would they --?
The Day Care?
Why would you do a thing like --
Dwayne please calm down!
I know who you are and what you want.
Zack, I dare you not to fall in love with me. I ain't gonna get serious with you, no way. But how can you resist me? I'm like candy.
You give him his drops?
You act like you never had peanut butter before --
You appear at his side out-of-the- blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first. You're in the red-hot center of big business and I thought you were a regular Joe.
Mary Sue?
What are your intentions? To make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and I don't mind admitting it was turned, I liked it, but ten hours later I feel like a fool. I don't get it. You, my father, here in this house, the cof- fee shop, it's making me upset, and I don't like being upset. Who are you anyway? And what are you eating?
Not the one I met this morning, hit- ting on me in as nice a way as I've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out I'm my Dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.
I was hoping to meet him.
Goodnight!
Scare me, why don't you?!!? You stupid son of a bitch!!!
It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it... I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and...
Well, you should be! Thanks to you, my heart is in my neck!
What in the hell are you doing here!! You're supposed to be over on San Vicente Boulevard having unsafe sex with that slut Sophie!!
With tears.
With tears?
Nothing much. She apologized.
I confide in you and rely on you more than anyone I've ever known! To say a thing like that now - without any reason - when I need you more than ever...
I don't think that's funny.
You'd probably have to go somewhere to really look into it.
Definitely.
Well, I'm certainly in the mood for a party.
You lied. If you lied then, maybe you're lying now. I can never belive you again!
I know. He loves that thing.
I know how scared I get when you're sick. So I waited to tell you. Until it was getting smaller. I thought that was best, maybe I was wr...
You're just doing your job.
That's good. I'm glad. Young love, as they say.
Yeah. Just checking. He being nice to you, Dil?
Jimmy, is it? Do you know me, Jimmy?
What was it?
Don't go looking for it, Dil.
Thank you.
That sure looks like fun... You know how long it's been since I was behind the wheel?
Oh, good.
Don't you want to come along, darling?
Thank you, darling.
En ingles Enrique. This is the United States. We speak English.
Good night, Enrique. She slides into the car--
In other words I never understood until today how much pain and anxiety you've been causing with your reviews. Steven, it's so unfair.
It's the strangest thing Father.
Sorry.
What's that?
Do you?
The footprints.
Let go of me!
Leave me alone! I don't ever want to see you again!
I guess we shoulda made some kinda plan for what to do if we get caught.
Yeah, right. We're not gonna get caught.
Tyler...
We've gone insane.
Yup.
You know what's happened, don't you?
What?
You know what I want to hear? I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life.
Why did she do it?
But we fought.
I love you, too.
Was she right?
I don't think do. It's not sleep; it's something else. It's all around me.
There aren't any personal lives for people like us. He made that very clear to me nine years ago - If I'd thought of my life with Charles as a personal life, I'd have left him then -
Why should anyone vote for him? He's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. Children - to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. And they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him - because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.
I'm surprised he got the votes he did.
I don't understand.
Why did you take your stuff from the office?
Actually, I've been once today already. I'll stay here with him.
O God!--O Nurse, how shall this be prevented? What sayest thou? Hast thou not a word of joy? Some comfort nurse.
Hey, honey.
What is your problem? Why'd you snap at me? I just wanted a statement.
You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues. You could give me something.
Stop it.
Okay, I'm undeserving.
Ironic, huh?
See, I know that.
I have given them morelove and more care every fifteen minutes of their lives, than you could manage in the next fifty years!
Shut up, sir. I'm concentrating.
I'm certainly not going to swim across.
Flashlight.
Coupons.
Which way?
Pancakes.
Why not?
Oh, Frederick!
What if they expel you?
Really.
Never.
I'm glad that's all over for me.
Oh, Mr. Jimmy.
He says here good-bye. I find it in his room. He is sorry, he says. He has had a wonderful life.
Very good. About one person in twenty just can't handle it. They go buggo. They're no way to predict who's susceptible, so stay alert.
Really?
And yet you suspect her.
Get comfortable. The bad news is we got six hours in this can, blowing down. The worse news is it's gonna take us three weeks to decompress back to the surface later.
Don't call me that, okay... I hate that. Alright, from now on we watch each other closely for signs of HPNS...
Couldn't stay away. You running mixture for us? Good. Couldn't ask for better.
Of course! I'm fine! I put on your beautiful dress, I slightly made up... I tried to get beautiful! Don't you like it?
I'm coming onboard! Throw down a ladder!
...Don't you drink?
Make me? How? You think he's going to torture me?
...Don't you like me?
No.
My God, I mean, you know how I am about insects.
There's a spider in the bathroom.
Wish me luck.
I can't sleep with a live thing crawling around in the bathroom.
Really?! He's a wonderful guy. He makes two million a year, and he worships me.
You worship yourself.
Greg.
It's not like I'm some modern Punk dickhead... It's obviously supposed to be a 1977 Punk look, but I guess Johnny Fuckface is too stupid to get it!
You know what I think? I think you only want me now, because I'm with somebody else.
That's not even --
DON'T LOVE HER TOO MUCH.
Pick me up?
Was it a nice funeral?
Did she mention any contests that she won? I mean she must have had some awards, she was so talented and all.
Mmmmmm. Root beer float that sounds good.
Why? What for?
Hey, I'm here.
Yes, if you like. Call me at work.
We're at Della's.
You like it there, don't you?
Okay. Yeah. What time?
This is ridiculous!
I can't.
Oh, but if you knew what it means to us to leave Europe, to get to America! Oh, but if Jan should find out! He is such a boy. In many ways I am so much older than he is.
Do you really want this, Dick?
Dorsia's nice.
Then I'll be there for you.
And then you'll be happy?
Look, as I have said and will continue to say, the instability of the assembler waste remains my priority --
I am aware of Dr. Argon's frustrations.
Can I help you, Mrs. Argon?
Under the circumstances, I can't fathom what makes Dr. Argon think we are ready for anything bigger. If C.N.N., or hell, if the E.P.A. knew what was in my basement --
I'd be careful if I were you. God knows what he's up to.
It's been going on for a while. Then he called me a disgrace to our family and that's when he hit me.
Of course he is -- the Castle precincts are not the safest part of the city after dark. People disappear up there regularly. If you want to lie in wait for someone, that's the place to do it.
You gain weight?
Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
Can --?
Aren't you?
No -- why? -- should I?
Money -- Ever heard of it?
Very little.
Did you ever see a stenographer with a decent frock on? -- One that she'd bought herself?
Neither am I.
I didn't like Preysing right off.
Yes --
Oh -- I was thinking -- Poor Baron -- Lying there, his eyes so open.
Well I got the tires rotated, I went shopping, and I made dinner.
You watch the draft this year? 'Course you didn't, idiot question. They try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? Only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. Doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles--hell, I wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. All this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. Compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?
Least he never called me that. With me, it was always "high-strung." "My Bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high-strung." Or "tightly wound," that was another one. You seeing anyone?
Yeah. Sort of. Daddy rounds 'em up. You aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.
You look awful good in that uniform, though.
Daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. He says so himself. Says "Even my son-in-law was better than this pinhead I got now".
Such pretty knees for a big boy!
Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar smitten with Susan Paine"!
You want to see me, Senator?
I read about it -- that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...
Did you bring your grey suit?
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
BENJAMIN?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Would you like me to seduce you?
Why is it?
Oh!
You're too good to me.
No jokes-these are friends, okay?
How'm I doing so far?
We hang down here and drop. The garbage'll break our fall.
Nicholas Van Orton? What are you, a czar?
That's classic.
Never did catch your name.
... two hundred dollars a toe.
Here's my number.
What are they offering?
I'm confused about a lot of things right now. Charlie's only one of them.
They're great.
"Dracula."
Huh?
Does this mean you don't like sex with girls?
You're like a kid, you're coming in here like it's Saturday night, you want me to say that you've got a fever -- you don't have to go to school...
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
That's so beautiful...
Love, you can still write to each other.
What are you sure about?
Imagine having a life where everything was easy...where you asked for things and people just brought them to you...
God, sometimes I think it would be so nice not to have to stretch ground beef or maybe drive a car with a CD player...
I belong with Deborah! We're going to South Africa!
Time for what?
You have to let me go!
Hey!
Two.
When was the last time?
Get him, Daniel! Knock his block off!
Okay, Barbie, let's get this over with.
Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
Well - what do you think of my elegant new suit?
Thank you, Ralph.
Oh. Why, Harry York. How nice to see you.
She thinks only for me... ... doesn't she?
Like an agent with one client.
Fine, thank you. Did you watch the show?
I can imagine... you know, all it needed was some taking in here and letting out there - are you sure you won't want it yourself?
Oh, are you a hairdresser?
Too much to do...but I'll walk you out.
Wow. You believe in me that much--
Where are you going?
Is it hard to learn?
...Yeah.
Are you takin' the pictures?
That French ain't it?
Karma... You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you.
What?
Karma.
One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over...
All your money's in Mexico.
It's okay. I forgive you. Now, let's say if I tell on you, I walk. And if I don't, I go to jail.
One hundred thousand put in an escrow account in my name, if I'm convicted up to a year, or put on probation. If I have to do more than a year, you pay another hundred thousand.
Way I see it, me and you only got one thing to talk about. What you willing to do for me?
Let's get realistic, baby. Sooner or later they're gonna get around to offering me a plea deal, and you know that. That's why you came here to kill me.
That doesn't matter; I like it.
You're crazy. I can't--I can't-no. No.
Louella... didn't she call me a spoiled little bitch?
'Forgive'...? For What?
That's impossible. I'm not Rheya.
You knew it. You all do. It's part of it. Maybe the most important part.
The dark side. The price you pay for all the fun you're having. You knew about it, of course. Didn't you?
Tonight. Just to test out the phone lines and all.
You'll call me, right?
When?
I would like you to call me. Would you do that? I would like that.
No. I know the answer to that one. I think you'd better take me home.
There's heat coming the door.
Sure.
Yes.
Yes, I'll have dinner with you.
Kramer, I've got to go. I've got an eight o'clock closing tomorrow down on Centre Street.
I think I'll just lie down awhile
Hi, this is Julia. Please leave a message after the tone.
You've always had hostility toward David ever since I mentioned him!
New York Times, Wash Post, Detroit Register, San Diego BEE, all in emission. No mention of the Girlscout. None.
That-that won t do. That s not the way it goes. You saw it, you tell it, that s the way...
I'm sorry, I guess I misunderstood.
Well... I thought you might be looking for a date.
No, just drunk... but that's OK. Where's your car?
It's true! I was here last year doing a piece, remember? I was in the bar with all these Northern trade unionists and their sponsored MPs. They were all incredibly fat and beery, huge trousers and braces. And so sweet. They all stood round me like children saying 'You! Working for television? You're just a young thing.' They wouldn't let me buy drinks even when I told them the programme was paying. They kept looking at my pass which was pinned here and saying 'Oo, can I?'
How-do-you-do, Mrs. Dickson.
He's at a board meeting.
Is that busy husband of mine busy?
No navicom. A lot of good you are now, Epps.
Of course.
Oh, his maid!... Stupid me, I thought perhaps she was someone that you may have been romantically involved with.
Our greenhouse.
I have no fear.
I don't know... Getting far away, the two of us, for example... And forgetting all this...
I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
He needed you, maybe. So do I.
I can't live like you do -- all your machines and -- cold metal and sharp corners --
You -- think I am -- I'm -- -- an animal.
That is not now, human!
I can use them.
JOSH!
JOSH!
Yeah, he's beyond human stuff like that.
Should we leave a note?
Why are we going here? I hate this place.
...no... this looks like a table of temperatures... Who's this from?
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks! Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?
Oh, sorry.
I'll get your back.
Come over to my house whenever you want. I'll tell my mom.
No, madam. We have culled such necessaries as our behoveful for our state tomorrow. so please you, let me now be left alone, and let the nurse this night sit up with you. for I am sure you have your hands full in all this so sudden business.
Farewell. God knows when we shall meet again.
Basically, I'm completely smitten with you, and I don't care if I'm making an ass out of myself right now, because you've seen me make an ass out of myself a million times, and you still want to be my friend.
You never tasted the stuff?
Don't litter my cab!
Everybody makes their own fun. F'you don't make it yourself, it ain't fun, it's entertainment.
Northern Books. What can I do for you?
Local Drama Group. Northern Books. No, it hasn't come in yet. As soon as it does. Yup, you too Marge.
Please?
I never knew.
I ought to have you and your friend thrown out...
Yeah.
Leave.
You know, I just spent three years trying to extricate myself from a relationship that turned out to be full of deception. And I've been doing just fine.
Come on in!
Leave.
Oh, you were excellent tonight, Pony.
Only a pig would say that!
This is l939. Can't you subtract?
That's easy. Me.
This morning. I saw someone I haven't seen in a long time.
What? Oh, I'm sorry, Nigel. I was just thinking...
I took two thousand out of the savings account. That was what I had in the bank when we got married.
My American Express...My Bloomingdale's Credit Card... My check book--
I'M NOT CRAZY. Don't you tell me I'm crazy.
No not yet.
Dear heart, I love you.
I have to go home and get my things.
With us.
I always wondered about that too.
I know.
Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
Listen to this, I love this part --
Men never get this movie.
Oh. You coming by tonight?
Heard you had quite a night.
We need blood. To nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener- gy.
That's the life spark. Exxence of magic and sorcery!
It's okay. It was always like that.
I've listened to you long enough. Let me out.
Again: what is the magician's weapon?
Everything.
Are you proud of me, Bill?
You shouldn't have had any doubts.
Is that what you want me to be?
So am I.
This is the result of their elixir of youth. They were to come and check on it during the night. I contrived to miss the appointment.
I've been living in it for over a year, the camper is mine.
Why did you do that, Billy?
Hi Ralph. Oh Danny, how'd you find me here?
Keep your voice down!
What else?
Trust you? Because of trusting you we have a son. Remember your son?
Sir, I... come to beg you to confess all, and swear allegiance to the king, that he might show you mercy.
That's out. No! It's too hot! You think I'm gonna let you get some, put on your clothes, then run outta here and never see you again in who knows when?
OK, see you downstairs.
Hi.
I'm just happy to see you.
-- It's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, Viktor. If you can't handle her, I will.
Not just that way. As a friend...
I'd like that.
Good night, Eve. I hope I see you again soon-
I'll be at the old stand, tomorrow matinee-
Paul said you were awfully sick.
We thought a doctor might help.
We thought it was an emergency.
He's a very decent man, Harold.
Shouldn't you lie down?
Are you from up there? Space?
Do you know Tom?
Now ain't you relieved, Walt?
You and your gypsies! They been gone a week!
I guess it was your grandfather, was it ... he called me to check in, said you were on your way and for you to call when you get in. Nice man... farmer I hear.
Yes, he is. He raises corn.
Damn lot of corn raised in Hollywood these days too.
Well, I ...
Okay, I give up.
The family hired you and I have just fired you, Mr Lombard.
No. You re fired! Get out of my house. And take your sick tape with you...
Laurence!
Monica, what did you do?
Think you can do better?
What do you expect? For them to bring it up here?
To the spacecraft. To investigate.
Because when we get down there --
Do yourself a favor, Norman. Are you listening? Don't tell anyone what you just told me.
That's quite a secret.
Dorothy Parker--
Tonight?
I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else.
God, just think, we'll never see Dennis again.
We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta. Just, you know, nothing special.
I can't go out. Not like this.
First big night of liberty and no date? You're pathetic, Wickwire.
Do you, uh, know...
Thanks for lying. But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up. Besides...
I promised myself I wouldn't let this happen till you were living alone. I was so torn when you called.
Maybe you need a few weeks in Bermuda, or something. Or go to a whorehouse! No?
I almost didn't.
I didn't sleep all night.
I was supposed to take the children to New England next week.
I'm sorry about your arm. Kabuo and I. Are very sor...
Fascist!
Dad stop it!
Hello, Travis.
You can fuck off, too.
Jake'll take care of me.
I ain't ever gonna see him again anyway.
I'm here with you.
No. I don't even know why I do it.
You know where they picked me up! Twelfth Street! I wasn't even near there!
Just like we all have fantasies, right? Things only we know, that we don't share.
It's trying to communicate.
Fucking liar.
You okay?
You try, I'm gonna pretend they're with somebody else.
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's go for it. We could get lucky.
No.
Funny, I thought it was a strong point.
I want you to get out of here, Norbert. Harold--I want you to sit down in the chair, and not lift a finger until Norbert is gone.
And what's that?
Can I tell you something?
If we don't get to their camp soon, we won't be able to tape the supplies coming in.
That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, Bill, Carl--or McGann?
They mean it.
Just listen. You don't have to do anything criminal.
You don't have to be criminal. A man will come up to your table and deliberately cheat. You'll see him, stop him, and the guy will make a big scene. There'll be chaos. And that's when it'll happen.
What the hell's going on?
You wrote a play on it, what play is that?
What's it called?
Maude, this man wrote this play!
Who was the father?
I haven't a clue.
You can drive and talk at the same time, can't you?
Was there a priest?
What's his name?
Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
Where are you from, Creasy?
Creasy. Pinta likes him.
I know. But which state?
I might be crazy, but I'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. There's a lot of things I can't change. I can't even think about them. I tried. But I couldn't even help Rosalie. I don't want to be bitter. I'm a naturally optimistic person. But you took advantage of that.
How could you possibly know what I've been going through?
You betrayed me, Charlie. You were never there for me or the children. And now you come and tell me, "Peggy, you're scared." Of course I'm scared. If you knew what I knew you'd be scared shitless.
What do you mean you and my father decided? Who the hell are you to plan my life? Let's get married and live happily ever after. Bullshit. I got knocked up. I had to marry you. I never had a choice.
What are you doing here?
My sister is dead, Paul. They would not leave the children.
You drink bug repellent?
No. I'm all right. It's working.
I'll take you up on that.
A coke.
Danny, it's not what you think.
Around.
...you don't have to make a million dollars -- just get any stupid job so we can at least start looking for an apartment.
That lunch was the worst, huh.
Excuse me, I have to copy this for Central Docketing by 2:30.
YES.
Sandro, I'm not coming down.
No -- that's what I know you were thinking.
Oh, Christ, I got to get out of here!
That means he probably will kill Johnnie.
Why'd you drop out?
Why? Didn't you know him well?
Nine years?
How long has it been since you've seen John?
My man? You told Wyatt you'd Disarmed those men. Do you Actually believe after that I Could see you as my man? You're Just a dirty little fixer.
That's hard to believe. The two of you seem so different.
Sort of. We used a process similar to the vulcanization of rubber and added bulk with a chain of chloroprene elastomers.
Like a glove.
It's a crime fighting costume, what do you think? It's underwear, so if you lose your clothes you'll still be decent.
Did you go?
What did you say?
What?
No. But once I heard...
Then we both are.
Objection.
Oh yeah? What did I get? What did I get I couldn't've gotten from somebody with no name any night of the week? You think your company is such a treat? Your moods, your... "pain", your problems... You think you're entertaining?
Dwayne got a little tipsy is all. He doesn't handle pressure well. It's over.
I'm in here.
Mary Had A Little Lamb.
Will I believe you when you tell me something?
You and Babe Brother are so much alike...
Hush.
Hush.
Besides. I've been starting point the last two years. Ain't no way some dumb- ass freshman is taking my spot.
Do you think he knows?
The look on your face! You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
I'm just so lonely.
I don't know.
I doubt that.
Tomorrow I'm going to put Sean on the bus. He won't want to go. He never does. He'll cry and want to hold on to me.
Should I keep reading?
No. Not mean. Just...very angry.
We couldn't find his name on the buzzer or on the mailbox, but...
Yes.
I'm not bugging you. Come and lie down. I'll give you a massage. Where'd you go today?
I'm lucky I found it. Someone put your box of dresses under a pile of rags in the garbage.
Well, no more stewin' those prunes every mornin', that's somethin', I guess... ... what are you goin' to do now, Chance?
Oh, Lord, Chance - I don't know what I was expectin' from you... I'm sorry for yellin' like I did... No sir, I just don't know what I was expectin' ... ... I 'spose I'd better gather up some breakfast for you...
Well, ain't that the truth...
Dammit, Boy! Is that all you got to say? More gobbledegook? That Old Man's layin' up there dead as hell and it just don't make any difference to you!
Oh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world.
... Well, ain't you the gentleman this mornin'... ... gotta go now, Chance...
But you was going to fight for me.
I went with you. Now I'm gonna marry Johnny and you're gonna leave me alone. Right? A person can see where they've messed up in their life, and they can change how they do things, and they can change their Luck. Maybe my nature does draw me to you, but I don't haveta go with that. I can take hold of myself and say yes to some things and no to something that's just gonna ruin everything! I can do that. Otherwise, what is this stupid life that God gave us for what? Ronny? Are you listening to me?
That's right.
"Probable"...applies to an event that may be real. Doesn't apply here.
But why would they murder...
Don't worry. I'll be all right.
The police are waiting for you up ahead. There's a roadblock. You have to go back.
It's easier not to tell if you don't know.
Sure.
The police know about Lathrop Wells. We have to go another way. Come on.
Him . . .
Who do I have to blow to get out of here?
And I still get my money. I need some cash right now. You can't just put me in the street.
The arrangement is over!
I paid for that.
Don't be an ass.
I want to meet them.
Do you keep in touch with them?
Well...
Do you know all their names?
I didn't know I had to.
Oh. You didn't tell me.
He goes to John Jay High School in Brooklyn.
This isn't friendship.
I think you're the Devil.
How?
You were quick enough to get Tom's help when...
Sit down, stop.
Oh. We always have play-offs in the middle of the night. It's the best time.
The Puffins and the Hawks. We're in extra innings. The Hawks have a really good line-up this year.
I thought so. Come on, I'm in a hurry.
Say, isn't this your twenty dollars?
-- I hope you like Miss Shawn --
It's been nearly a year since our first time and you're still married to my sister, which...I now realize is fine because you're probably much more in love with her than you know.
Look, I'm just as much at fault.
Oh. Bigfoot gets his out of a can.
What are they?
Is that what you used to do?
I saw his stuff in the bathroom.
Stop laughing, I don't say it's the truth, I'm saying...
My God, you're as crazy as...
For Agnes.
For the Church?
She's been touched by God, yes.
You think she's a saint?
The father!
How? How? She hallucinates, stops eating and bleeds spontaneously. Is that supposed to convince me she shouldn't be touched. Give me a miracle.
Why must he be anybody?
Who is he?
How do you know we're not heading in the wrong direction?
And do you like it that way?
You happy, baby?
Have you tackled the Great Reorganization yet?
I think you know that.
What're you talking about?
I didn't do anything wrong. I swear. I just had a few drinks.
Causes sleep.
That's genius, Viktor. Was that Simone's idea?
What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up?
And you're not the wife.
Jesus, Sally. I'm not the enemy.
Damn straight.
It's not a contest.
Let's get the kids.
You're looking pretty chipper this morning.
I know. And he's like psychotically obsessing over every little detail.
God, that's so pathetic. I bet she didn't even notice him.
Jesus! Listen to this one: "Do you remember me? Airport shuttle, June 7th. You: striking redhead with yellow dress, pearl necklace, brown shoes. I was the bookish fellow in the green cardigan who helped you find your contact lens. Am I crazy, or did we have a moment?"
Oh, we totally have to.
We should call him and pretend to be the redhead.
How about some evening clothes?
But John... why didn't you go to a hospital?
Was there anyone that I know?
I don't hate you, Jimmy. But I have a couple questions that I wanna ask....
Yeah?
I don't get it.
That's because you' re not a total moron like they are.
Now where's she goin'? --
You think that's all we busted -- You should see...
Too much excitement. Or maybe it's just the heat. How about the surrey. Can you fix it?
Maybe you're going about this all wrong. Why not try telling him we'll do the cookin' and mendin' and washin' for him. That usually works. Yeah, but suppose he took us up on it. Where would we be?
Maybe in Sonora.
Do you love me?
Terry what's happening to you?
You?
Who says?
Terry, what's wrong?
Sure.
He's gone to check your answers on his computer.
No. We keep it in the backyard. Of course, in the house. It's in there.
What of it?
Then if you won't get out, I'll have you thrown out.
Are you excited about becoming a collector? DUSTY Yeah.
What of it?
I did, didn't I? Look! A shooting star.
Hurrts! It hurrrrts!
Come on--let's parole 'em.
Louis, the house is beautiful.
Don't even think about it. Rachel is an exceptionally well rounded young woman, who happens to be attending Princeton this fall. She's way too smart to fall for your line of b.s.
My daughter, Rachel.
I hope for your sake you grow out of this immature phase. It's going to get you into trouble.
No it doesn't. I see right through you.
Good luck, Sebastian.
I just listened... and believed everything they told me. 'She stole the money.' 'We don't want to get her in trouble.' 'No don't bring the police in'...
I don't have any cream. Sorry.
I know who you are.
Yes.
Thanks. You take anything in your coffee?
I ought to call the police right now!
I've been so worried, dear. where are you?
No, we are.
Could we sit down someplace?
Smitty.
Let me go home.
C mon, you know what I like to hear...
Please, Ted. I never would have brought it up if I thought--
Dad --
Since grade school.
What are you, out of your mind!
Yeah.
I bought him a watch too.
Yeah.
It's not that easy. Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please. I can't. I don't want to be alone. I need to know I'm going to be taken care of.
All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me. He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond. More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole.
I have to take a shower.
I don't know how.
Two p.m. Great. Bye-bye.
Hello? Yeah...
I can't... I've got to fly to Boston tomorrow.
You'll laugh.
Not you. Him.
Yes... Jeffrey.
No! I look ridiculous!
It's gone to the top.
I don't believe this. I'm calling the doctor.
Get your clothes off.
Don't shilly-shally, Louis. Give the little girl her promise.
Get your clothes off!
So simple to say, so hard to do.
Don't overwhelm me with the details. You know how I hate that.
Come on. Try.
Maybe now's when you tell me about it.
Yeah?
Norm, that's terrific!
You're the animals - all of you!
Don't go. I'm frightened. I can love a coward, I can't love another dead man.
Don't tell me you're sorry.
I'm not sorry.
One minute but then--
...No... never in so many words...
Yes, Jon. That Karl.
That's wonderful language. It would move a stone.
Norm?
Is he going to see this?
No, no, it isn't. It's cool.
Not very often.
That isn't true.
You don't know what I'm thinking.
Sandro ...What's the matter?
No, Sandro... Please...
No reason why...
No, I'm going.
Actually -- in this dream -- I was your mother.
Totally -- you were being very, very bad. You went up in the plane and jumped out. You had a parachute, but it didn't open.
... I was dreaming ...
We were back in high school. You wanted to join the sky diving team, but I wouldn't let you.
No.
Yes, Patrick?
I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
I saw a picture of you.
It must be weird for you to have so many sisters?
Business is good, you're busy?
He's married...
--- yeah, yeah, I get in it in my ear. It's TMJ is what it's called technically.
Tempural-something-mandibular, thing with something, I dunno. But it affects my ear, I don't even know if I have TMJ exactly but just very tight, like - it's like a muscle spasm and it's just gets so clenched --
Did someone say I wasn't nice?
Would you like to learn them?
Maybe I could start you out.
But he just never troubled to have you get any schooling?
Don't you even know your letters?
Where did you get it?
You shouldn't have done that. I know what it meant to you.
Take it back. Till you sell your book.
Of course they will. You just have to be patient. I'm betting on you.
I love him.
C'mon! The guy's working with you. You always know chapter and verse about everyone who works --
Did you sleep with her?
Tuck that shirt in, David Lee.
I was frightened and I didn't know what to think! But you know-I believe him. I think he just wants to go home. Wherever the hell that is...
No! Not the police! Don't call them!
Don't be so cheeky, Bruce.
You know, I don't think so. I'm confused but you know, I don't think he'd ever hurt me. I don't think he'd hurt anyone.
No, I can't have that! They'll come with their cars and their guns and their handcuffs--
You sure?
Well, he's popular. A lotta people like Janiro. You beat him and it only figures they'll wanna see you get a title shot. But, what do I know? I should keep my mouth shut, I should...
Joey's right. Janiro's up-and coming, he's good looking...
What are you driving at? You want me to get him to sign that?
Shut up, Tommy!
Well, then, that's great! And that's a great place to leave it! It's no use my barging into this now and--
What are you laughing at? Who was that on the phone?
He's with his friends.
He's a grown man. Be doesn't have to call every five minutes.
Don't bring that up. You're the one who wanted us here.
Ma! Please! You're driving me crazy.
These gentlemen are from Salzburg.
Wolfi! Your father is dead.
Wolfi.
Come in out of the rain, Bud.
He's the opposite of you. He's more like me. Cold, calculating.
In the morning.
We talked.
God, you ask a lot of questions.
Good.
So you'll stay?
It doesn't have much to do with science.
He couldn't be that dumb. The guy's a trained killer. Bud's idea of a fight is arm-wrestling One Night over laundry duty.
That way. You?
Someone was at that window. I saw the curtain move.
That never changes. You know, when you and Grandma are gone, the family's gone. I never see the cousins anymore.
Are you alright, Wade?
Been putting my files into it. You take sugar and milk?
What are you talking about?
The ramp?
Wait a minute! Let go there!
The Heart of the Ocean. Cal, it's... it's overwhelming.
Do you believe in all of that?
Do you realize that you're accusing me of ....
No one else had the combination of that safe. You took them. What did you do with them?
Don't you remember....
Now see here, Julia. You're counting a little too much on my being absent-minded. You've been taking a little here and there for some time, and I haven't said anything about it. But this is fifty thousand dollars!
No, you don't.
Oh, thank heaven.
That's my business.
-- of bring -- inadequate -- I mean just because you happen to be inadequate in one way --
Go ahead!
Like sex crime victims, underwear inside-out, bound with electrical tape.
No. He don't.
Do you have a phone?
...No thanks.
Have you told her we're getting married?
Yes, I do.
Well, he's got his gun on his hip there, and he looks like a nice enough guy. It's a real shame.
No.
Sing it to me, Frankie!
You haven't monkeyed with his car there, have ya?
Yah, this guy's smaller than his buddy.
Is he one of the loonies?
Whew! Hiya, boys!
That!
What's that?
What's the matter? What's the matter with you? You look pale. You okay?
I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple.
I don't, but... I do. It's just... I love you, Bruce. I don't want you to...
Dad, here! You don't have to stop, just slow down. You can tell Mama I jumped out. She knows that's the kind of thing I'd do. She won't blame you.
Good morning, Rita. How are we today?
Nobody saw. But I don't think so.
Daddy!
Blackjack? I don't understand--
My God, Lenny. What is it?
Are you sure it's real?
A real palace. She rattles around alone in that thing--
And they just answer them?
To you?
I don't... why... why do you do this?
This is just... so...
Yes, I do.
I think that if I'm old enough to accept a new baby, and if I'm old enough to accept a new room, I'm old enough to go to California.
She is not a child Harry, she is a young woman, she's on the brink of...
You're being narrow-minded.
You were just having a fight about me. Wouldn't you like to hear my opinion?
I didn't know that. Mine's still brown.
What is that? What are you doing?
Highliner, please.
Jabez -- Jabez!
Yeah, I know.
Well...
I know, it's pretty silly, isn't it?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Wait a minute. Do you mean... don't tell me you... in front of him.
What's wrong, Jake? Forget to take your antidote?
You have quite a mind, Jake. I loved your friends. That chemist - the Ladder. What an imagination you have!
In front of him, Ann, yes.
How many times have you asked me that? How many times?
You are in trouble.
The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies.
What are you going to do?
But a priest...?
She didn't look Italian to me.
Them days, you deal with Sheriff Wade or you didn't deal at all. First of the month, every month, he remind you of who you really workin' for.
Don't bring her to the house no more.
I don't like her.
I don't know! She don't look like Italian to me. Plenny a nice Italian girls around.
Not if I can help it.
Don't come any closer, Abbe. God's watching.
You don't believe in anything, do you?
Well. It's for you.
There is no direct evidence, no.
I want to, Palmer -- more than anything. But it has to be real. It has to be true.
Jack!
You owe me one, Virgil.
Awwww...
So what's new?
Hey, hi!
That's none of your goddamn business, Caesar.
Five.
Jesus, Caesar!
Oh, what do they know?
Like Joey? Are you afraid to mention his name?
Wow! This is like my dream room! Are these all records!
What was all that stuff about enlarged holes and tight cracks?
You're right about that. So this is your record collection?
Really? Can I see it?
Oh, sure. Here. Anything else, Beth can get you? Some more chicken, perhaps. Let Beth check the fridge.
Lloyd, listen to me. EVERYTHING has changed. You've had sex. No matter what you might think, nothing will ever be the same between you two. You might be sixty. You might be walking down the street, and you'll talk to her about something, whatever. But what you'll really be thinking is 'We had sex'.
Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
Done what?
I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
I don't believe it!
Oh my. Oh,my, oh my, oh, my. So, what do we do now?
We do?
For how long? We've just about run out of everything!
Excuse me.
Yes. She suffered longer. She was in Ravensbruck.
That's a fine thing to throw up to me after all I've been to you....
I had a dream that Grandma died.
Mr. Webster -- you will help him?
I thought you quit the band - I never hear you practice anymore.
The people at Silver Meadows aren't psychos.
Wendy, of course. I'm sorry. You must think I'm ripe to be checked into Silver Meadows.
Oh Wendy.
Well, I saw what I saw, and if you don't want to believe me --
We've been through this Wendy James Taylor was actually at that clinic up near Boston.
I felt he did not like me.
The General you don't even know him.
Come, Thea, if you're going to claim him as your father you've got to make up your mind. They'll be leaving any minute.
Come on.
Yeah. This is it. I have some shopping to do.
What?!
You didn't stop anywhere else?!
I know.
breaks down into heavy sobs.
What does that mean for Evan?
So what did you find.
Well, yeah, yeah. You'd love it. It's really entertaining. You'd have a good time. I know you would.
Looks real bad if the teacher's late for class. It's really nice to talk with you, Sam.
Well, thanks a lot.
Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
...So?
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
What else?
Don't you want to walk, Tom?
Children, will you go into the next room? I want to talk to Chris alone.
My father took me fishing here when I was a kid. He could name every fish in the lake. And for every fish he named, he had a fishing story. I hated fishing, but I loved his stories.
Yes.
You won't go to the police if I tell you?
I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him.
No. It makes me nervous to think about it. Let's do this.
Benjamin?
Hello.
That's the girl I love.
I'm not listening.
Don't take all day at that table, David Lee.
Your dancing's very good.
Just stop it. End it here.
... I don't get it done often.
See you? He can smell you from there.
But what about you and the baby? You need me.
How would you like to go visit your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles...next week during your spring vacation, you could do research on your mom.
Yes, my lord.
The poor girl's out of a job.
Dynamite --
Uh, atomic energy?
Oh, yeah?
So long, nothing! Where's Bruce Baldwin's wallet?
We'll see.
And you wanted him to make a list!
Do you enjoy doing this to me or what--
How!
Maybe the antenna's broken.
Hey... the fuse.
B-b-books. You... you killed five men... singlehanded.
I never c-c-carry arms. I'm... a writer.
P-p-p-please, I'm not armed. M-m-my G-god. You killed... Little Bill.
I... I... think I'm... shot.
Could it have damaged the ship?
Hey, Miles. Good to see you.
To begin with, where Mary is. Do you?
Last Friday. She left work, and home... I was in Tucson over the weekend... I haven't heard from her, not even a phone call.
A good reason, I suppose.
What do you know about it?
Gee, Jeff, I thought you were gonna go take a piss, not join some alcoholic nudist colony.
The alarm clock.
I missed my therapy. I overslept.
I'll take him to the doctor tomorrow. Come on now, sit down and go on eating. And you, look after him as if he were a sick brother. Be understanding. Now finish eating and then go to bed. Everyone in bed by eight o'clock!
I know- because of our sexual problem, right?
Mm. I enjoyed the ride. Sorry you didn't.
Right here.
I told you. I'm like positive.
Besides. You think there's like a chance I'm gonna get into college back there?
I'm not ready yet. I gotta do this for a little while.
My gosh, Norman.
Sex isn't ugly, sex is one of the most beautiful things in life, the creative power of the universe is behind it.
He's been acting real strange lately. He won't even look me in the eyes anymore.
Why would I lie to you, Auggie? You think it was easy to come here and walk into this place? Why would I do it if I didn't have to?
Kill him!
Kill him!
You didn't write to me for more than a year. What was I supposed to think?
I know.
This is the last time, I promise. And I'm keeping strict accounts.
Thank you. Elisabeth, I didn't mean to...
Oh.
But what is the truth?
It's that Mrs. Goodhall you have to be careful of, Wilbur.
I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that. I mean, I don't mean I'm happy you're uncomfortable, but, yknow... I'm such a loser. Every time I come to a party I tell myself I'm going to be different and it's always exactly the same and then I hate myself after for being such a clod.
How would you like to join The Denominators? The Math Team could really use a new brain. We lost our best logarithm guy last year.
Somehow I imagined books. I thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.
Are you surprised that I know what it is?
He wanted me to see -- he thinks I was -- infected by you.
You have to go. He'll never stop. Leave this place. Find another.
I want to talk. I just learned again.
Why did you build this whole place ?
He's got a reason.
And I'm supposed to care?
You're wrong to sell Ich short.
You met her.
But -- other people from our planet should see what I've seen -- they should witness this for themselves.
I know I shouldn't have, but there it was, just sort of lying out, and I couldn't resist and -- and -- I suck.
Grady!
Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.
I don't know -- maybe -- I don't think so.
Since sixteen or so.
No kidding. Who else would have done it?
He looks perfectly fine.
I think he's feral.
I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your...
I wish I knew. It's for my boss. He's fighting his water bill, and he wants me to find all manner of bills from all kinds of places. The easiest thing would probably be if I just squeezed back there with you and poked around myself. Would that be okay?
Hey, you ! What the hell is going on ?
You heard voices, you know you did.
Sure. Let's go home.
No, I want to walk.
For how long?
A week? A year?
A psychiatrist?!
Oh.
What?
I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood.
Are you in trouble, son?!
Yeah? You sure?
Daniel, give him the Trix.
Well of course. Who loves a big fanny on a man?
He's paralyzed !
What do you want me to do ?
You gotta let me go, Daddy. Please...
I ain't your business no more, Daddy. Please let me go.
Yes!
I'm not going to discuss this with you anymore. You're making no sense.
He'll have it good. Some day.
He was born fighting. And born hungry.
You are no good to me -- in jail.
What makes you so sure?
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.
I... I'm leaving... I can't take anymore...
That would be impossible.
I give you my soul...
Victor. I love you,
They already know it's you.
Look, the only way I can get permission to fly is if I agree to help them. Which is what I have to appear to be doing. So I give them something they already know. You.
I told them you got a half a million dollars in Mexico, and you want me to bring it here.
It's true, isn't it?
Okay. I'm sorry.
I wasn't trying.
Let's get something straight, Jeff -- I never asked you to leave your wife.
Handle what?
Are you sure that's what you want?
And the pony?
There is no lid! Nothing's going on between Sam and me. Coulson. Mr. Sam Coulson and me.
Why should you do that?
Well, for heaven's sake!
I know, I know. But still, somehow I don't feel better.
You talk like an actor.
A misunderstanding, people taking the wrong meaning from things. I wasn't declaring war, Harry. I was just saying my prayers.
Well, I just...
Okay. Shit, Thelma! What'd you do? I mean, what did you say?
My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you. He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. I trust it does not inconvenience you too much.
Lemme see the map.
Holy shit.
I changed my mind, Early. I'm not gonna climb up that Hollywood sign with you... I decided. I think your mean, and you hurt people.
Your family sent cards. It was much appreciated.
-- It's called a projector.
Listen, Viktor, I have good memories of those days too -- but this isn't about that or you or me or some high-minded ideal. This is business.
You move right along, don't ya.
I can take them to work with me -- I can shift things around --
Is that right, dad?
I hate that smell.
Yes. You have a brother in service here, do you not? I forget his name.
Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. Not one who's treating me, of course. And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence.
Of course.
So what do you wanna do?
Just tell me that Evan doesn't have Jason's illness...
Steve --
Anything.
Why? What for?
I still think you should go down.
Are you going down there?
I don't know. First I thought it was Jim but--
Frank? I'm frightened.
I feel as if I'm walking under water.
That's the third time he's called today.
No, an arm, he said. I told him you were sure the item would be in Mr. Hunsecker's column in tomorrow's...
Then why don't we just get it out of the way.
Oh, you will?
Yes you have. You were thinking you were gonna get a good night kiss.
The way you cook. If you could make love, I'd marry you.
Well, it wasn't a reduction like you do it! Boiling down half a ton of bones...
Uh-oh. I mention marriage, all of a sudden... Ve haff to ta...
Thank you Ben. Annabelle!
Okay, if they're going to have a sauce, put something in it besides flour and chicken broth...
Don't bother. Mrs. Brown'll be along for it in a minute.
No trouble at all.
Just because you can't even work a zipper. It was very thoughtful, Eve, and I appreciate it-
While you're cleaning up, I'll take this to the wardrobe mistress-
They are lovely. Aren't they lovely, Birdie?
Adorable. We now got everything a dressing room needs except a basketball hoop.
Well, you've done so much... what's new?
The curtains. I made them myself.
Jesus.
If I may so bold as to say something - did you ever hear the word "union"?
Behind in your dues? How much?
Oh no... No you don't.
What now?
Who says?
Betadyne doesn't hurt.
Well, if the Clock People give you any inside information on the end of the world, drop us a postcard.
You really suck, you know that?
What?
'Bye, Jeff.
Who told you this?
William, I can't indulge these delusions, even when you're in this state.
I do believe you...
What are you talking about?
Maybe I don't need your ideas. Maybe I can do better on my own.
Nooo. This way the rotation stays the same.
I just have two more pen pals and then I'm done.
...am starting to get jealous. I read in the newspapers about the Italian strike and riots in Milan. I hope you weren't...
We searched the house.
Huh?
Oh my God... you mean... the two of you dated?!
I... love... Pat Benatar.
How did you meet Choco?
Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends?
Look, they were all on their third Mai Tais by the time I got out there anyway.
I said I was sorry.
You're the one with all the ideas.
It's not like I'm trying to attack you --
Angolan Military. Went back to the fighting. Disappeared. Who knows...?
Why are you trying to hurt me?
Still can't make up your mind, huh? Gotta go, Royce.
Well, let me warm you: I'm going though with this. The more everybody fucks with me, fucks with my head, the more it just makes me want to finish. So don't expect me back crying in your arms any time soon, okay?
A little melodramatic, don't you think.
They probably want to find out when they were made.
I'm sorry.
Do I make you nervous?
Can you? I couldn't.
Well, just trying to figure out who you are, and how you might have become --
I'm saying, Frank, in trying to figure out who you are --
No, let me pull over so I can pay full attention.
I'm sure, Simon, they did something real off for you to feel this way... But when it comes to your partners -- or your kid -- things will always be off for you unless you set it straight. Maybe this thing happened to you just to give you that chance.
I don't know the last time I've been out of the city... Hey, my arms are tanning. I used to tan great. We gotta stop soon so'se I can check on Spencer.
Yes. I really would.
Anybody here who's interested in what Melvin has to say raise their hands.
It seems to have survived.
Yes?
No thank you.
Jack, what could you possibly be thinking? What about my job?
What are you talking about, Jack?
Annie goes to a great school.
Are you out of your mind?
Are you okay?
Who?
Truman, you're gonna be late!
Wow! Brrrother!
Boy! Wow!
Let me see!
Ohhh-hh... what's happening now?
I can't see, let me see...
So it's an honor?
Someone will find me.
Keep away --
A third party?
You should sleep, Cathy. Lie down and close your eyes. Try to forget everything.
I love you. Please, I love you.
I love you. How many more times do I have to say it?
Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
When I close my eyes, I see Miss Wollsten. I can't think of anything else.
She is dead at peace.
-- Studying.
Well, of course, right...
Tch. What are you --
I thought I felt mean tonight. But I'm not I'm just all mixed up... .
It's fun dancing with your eyes closed. I'm floating. I'm floating... .
I checked the register for this man Thompson. We don't show him but I figured he might be part of your team.
Sir? This telegram came for you. Actually, it isn't for you. It's for somebody named Thompson, but it says 'care of Raoul Duke'. Does that make sense?
I'm sorry. It's just you're a really nice guy, and we don't want to see you get hurt.
Jack! This is the archeological find of the century!
Eat your heart out. Is Annabelle there?
You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
What did he say?
Please.
Rose, I know what's going on. Homer told me. I got pregnant, too--about a year ago. I've been through this.
You ain't been through what I been through, Candy.
Hi...
Hi...
How did he expect to do that?
Don't you want dinner first?
Well, you know...
Oh, okay.
What?
A man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.
It is only too possible. Love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.
But if, when I love, I am unhappy, I will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.
Your word "empty" makes me laugh. Is it fortunate, or unfortunate? If it is fortunate, I congratulate myself. If it is unfortunate, I do not care, for I am not aware of it.
Many worthy of attention; but valuing is something more. I could value only someone whom I loved.
This is such a street of whiners.
Marilyn Manson...and I guess he's into guys. I hate nose rings. And the blue eye shadow thing really isn't working.
No.
He seems lonely.
A what kind of doctor?
I can't believe you asked my father's permission.
Thank you, kind sir.
No, dammit, I would easy.
Serveza yourself!
Something's wrong. I know it. I've heard rumors of cholera spreading south from Hamburg.
Nothing. Still nothing.
And not a word of them to Father. He's agitated enough not hearing from Victor.
I should go. I should leave today.
He said he didn't know about it.
What?
He killed a guy who works for him the other day.
You believe that? Yeah, well, I guess you have to trust him. I'd have second thoughts on that, but then I know 'em.
Mr. Walker's my buddy. Ask him about Ordell.
He told me to go outside. "You may leave us now." It's all part of his pathetic attempt to be "the man." You know Mr. Walker don't you?
That coke was yours, wasn't it?
I dunno...
You already knew that?
Beaumont Livingston?
Rapidamente! Everybody in the world is going to see!
Yeah, I hit a three at the buzzer.
No -- you musn't. He thinks I've bewitched you. He won't believe it - he'll hate me even more! My only chance is to stay away from him.
Oh, no wonder I'm starving. I'm going to fix a sandwich. You want one?
It is for that he hates me.
Then why does he persecute me? My family told me what kind of man he is, how he stole my mother and then abandoned her --
For a moment, when he looked at me so sadly, I felt that I had wronged him. But then --
That's too bad.
Because -- somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.
I don't know. I guess I'm not afraid of them.
Hi, honey. Look at this. It's a "Chef's-Mate." Dicer, slicer and peeler in one. Never needs sharpening. Dishwasher safe.
Thanks. Steel pipes and baseball bats.
No. I don't want your work to be cruddy.
It's amazing. You commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if I'm nitpicking. Try and get this. When you edited that...
That's not going to be the way we say good-bye. Even though I think what you did was rotten -- it's not all impersonal. You mean something to me.
I don't wan to discuss work.
I knew what you meant.
You're lucky I came after you so you got that off your...
It's stupid, of course.
You both did it?
You... fed on me?
Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are!
Yes.
The theatre?
Yes, of course.
Don't you have enough sense not to bother people when they're sleeping?
Good! Leave me alone when I'm sleeping. I'm gonna get a lock on my door, to keep ya ass outta here.
Wake up? Saturday is the lone day I get to sleep late.
Do me a favor. Go to work.
Well, look, I have to go. Gotta' get up early and waste some more money on my overpriced education.
Okay, sounds good.
You told me this was how it happened.
I know. I know it all. Save your strength. I already know everything you're going to say. You're in the Jacket right now, aren't you?
You have nothing to fear, William.
Yeah.
I believe it.
There's enough in it for a hundred speeches, things people ought to hear nowadays. You be careful of it, won't you dear? It's always helped keep your father alive for me.
Now, are you sure you want to drive that horse back yourself? There are plenty of people 'round here who do that sort of thing.
When you say 'nothing' that way, it's not nothing.
Now we love Drew and Joe in verbo- ten? What's going on?
Then what will you say?
Well, remember how you told me about "lightning striking"? The nature of it's in there somewhere.
What choice!!?
Well, it's worth it, really? I mean, how much longer do you think you need to work with Pilgrim?
We'll have more room because we're moving onto the ranch. They have this empty house near this creek. It's actually pretty... OK... I love you. Dad wants to talk to you.
They're already all settled in, Frank. Anyway, I'm sure Annie wants her privacy.
Honey, what happened?
How?
What about me?
I thought you said you were at the epitome of your life.
I am?
I must say, in your novels you stoke the most unrealistic expectations.
No. What about your camera girl? Did she come?
In the private aircraft hangar. Anybody could have walked in.
I'll get my clothes.
Right.
In the kitchen.
No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you.
Give me that!
Agnes, what happened to the baby?
That's enough.
What happened to the baby?
She can't remember.
Agnes, who did this to you?
I hate him.
Agnes you won't burn in hell. It's alright to hate him.
God! It was God. And now I'll burn in hell because I hate him.
It was alive wasn't it?
It was dead.
You made him strike out. You wished it on him. You want to lose. It's too hard for you to believe in something. It's hard to have faith. It's hard Nwork to trust somebody.
I'm in love. For the first time. It's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.
Dad. What are you doing here?
What do you call it? You told her you had doubts.
Yeah, right...
No....I though I'm afraid.
Drove into Sierra? What for?
Not with what they pay me...
That s the one...
Uh huh. To Paris. My firm has an office there and I m going to be heading it up.
You didn t seem to mind offering to help me on Christmas day when you were unwrapping that Prada bag I gave you.
Hey, kind of under a little pressure here.
You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place.
Much more...uh, he have much more time to "serve?"
I know who he is.
I'll explain everything later. Can you meet me tonight?
Geez. Looks like this thing goes higher than we thought. You call his home?
Oh my God!
I'm sure that was the idea.
White girl named Melanie Ralston. Another girlfriend of Ordell's.
It was her coke I got busted with. She knows everything, but she's not part of it, and she's pissed cause she's not part of it. Ordell wouldn't even let her stay at the meeting. She tried to talk me into ripping off Ordell.
Not yet.
And his wife?
What do you mean?
Holy shit. Your brother didn't tell him about the nature of our relationship, did he?
Won't he be able to tell?
God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff.
Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs.
Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
It's too much pressure, it's not his crowd.
Meaning that she made the second date a family audition, which is the kiss of death for Lloyd.
Lloyd is doomed.
Goodnight.
Yah, that can happen.
He's got that nervous talking thing. I told him not to speak.
...and if I did, what's in it for moi?
It's true.
Much more, Terry. Much, much more!
Grace, I put it on the table near your --
No, you didn't.
Is that how you play?
Mummy!
Are you pretty involved in his upbringing?
Hey, Mister. You gotta quarter?
Give me your hand.
I even guessed his hotel, didn't I?
Since that guy rear-ended me in Palm Springs.
You know why I forgive Eve? Because she's left good behind - the four of us, together like this, it's Eve's fault - I forgive her...
... and Bill. Especially Bill. Eve did that, too.
She is a louse.
Groom.
You know what I'm going to be?
A married lady.
This isn't punishment, I don't believe in punishment. It's for your health. Obviously you're sick if you can act like that.
It's November.
Do you want to learn or not?
What were they saying? About you? In there?
Manny...
The most important thing is that you're home! We was gonna have cold eatin' tonight, 'cause of the heat, but now, I'm goin' to cook!
We're mortgaged to the eyeballs, Truman. There's the car payments. Are we just going to walk away from our financial obligations?
Sweetheart, you can get a whole big bunch.
And then what, Truman? We'd be back to where we were five years ago. You're talking like a teenager.
I changed my room at the Hotel.
I don't think you are sufficiently in awe of it. Get the castor oil.
Maybe it is! How the fuck would you know?! You don't know a fucking thing! You can't get scared, can you get angry?!
That's easy for you to say! You can't get scared, you don't remember how, you fucking idiot!
You pathetic piece of shit. I can say whatever the fuck I want and you won't have a clue, you fucking retard.
And then we'll exchange phone numbers and you'll leave and never call and I'll go to work and feel great for the first hour and then slowly turn into a piece of dirt by lunch. Why am I putting myself through this? It was very nice... uh meeting you. Good night..
I mean you don't have to say nice things to me... That kind of thing is a little old fashioned for what we're about to do.
You don't have to say that.
... and then we'll probably have a drink and talk and get comfortable with each other and... and we'll... then you'll sleep over and then in the morning... ... you'll be distant and you won't be... able to stay for breakfast... you'll just have some coffee maybe...
Well... you're walking me home. I... I guess you're sort of... attracted to me and you'll want to come upstairs for... coffee...
Leave your sister out of it.
Oh, come on, Amado--
In what way?
Pony and I are friends.
Ew! Oh, Buff! Relax!
What are you and Mike going to do?
Oh, do not go
What's wrong?
What?!
Why you never go back to Lady Jone's and learn your letters? You liked going there I remember. Seeing the other children. Then all a sudden, you stop.
There was a boy there...said mama was a jailbird...said he could prove it..
You got to go sometime. You got to go out there by yourself sometime.
I'm just sad Ben -- I mean it was... you were, but, you know. I just don't know...
Now you need me.
I don't wanna take your money, Mr. Masry.
Well, based on my knowledge of the region, its culture and her people I would have to say it's a box.
Absolutely. I made enough for an army.
Why?
Why not?
You a scorpion? That's it. You're a scorpion. I can tell.
Rock music died in 1970, that's what I think. Before that it was fantastic. I can tell you that. Everybody was crashing, hanging out at the Fillmore. Me and my girlfriend Ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? It was unbelievable. Rock Stars everywhere. That Airplane -- that's my group, man. All Libras. But now everybody's split or got sick or busted. I think I'll move to one of those communes in Vermont, you know? That's where all the smart ones went. I stayed here.
Why don't you come to a commune with me?
You're kidding.
An unhappy woman...
I don't give a damn about her spiritual health.
I know you don't.
Because I am a moral person.
Bullshit!
She's happy with us and she could go on being happy if she was left alone.
Then why did you call the police in the first place Mother, huh?
Bullshit yourself!
Catholic Church doesn't have a corner on morality...
You re wrong about my being there, though. Carlos borrowed my car that day, his had broken down... Leon saw it, like you, assumed I was there, thought he d wait to ask for a lift. But Carlos turned up, with the tape you found... Leon got his lift, and accidentally picked up the tape with his photo equipment when he got out. He watched it, confronted Carlos, threatened to tell the police about the hotel... I don t know how he knew about the hotel. Perhaps Carlos talked too much... My husband did not tell me... You more or less guessed the rest... I didn t know any of this before you left for Los Angeles.
Think what you like. But don t presume to understand.
I didn t know my husband and Friedman knew each other. I just... Do you think we spoke about it? I ve known for five years. He s known I ve known for five years... But not once have we spoken about it. There are things one just doesn t speak about...
Good.
That's just what things came to. Sometimes you can't help that. It doesn't change me respecting you. And now you let me down. I expected more from you, you know? I really did. I expected you to--
I guess I wonder sometimes if people ever stay together for good.
Think you can narrow it down for me.
Tot ice skating? Tots can't ice skate. Liberty Bell's still getting the hang of stairs.
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.
Dealing with stuff way beyond my maturity level. Where is everyone?
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug. Where have you been?
I'm losing my faith in humanity.
You look a little morose, honey. What's eating you?
Yeah, she does.
No, but you know Bren. She dreams big.
I'd love to.
It feels fine now, Jabez.
I'll try hard -- I just can't take it all in.
Looks don't concern me, Maestro. Only talent interests a woman of taste.
This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this.
I'm going home.
Thanks.
Diane.
No, stay. Please stay with me.
On second thought, would you let me have it? I'll get the tickets.
Wait a minute, Bruce. Have you got that money?
No thanks, I've still got those. Well, I'll step into some working clothes and hop over to the Press Room for the background on this yarn. It'll be kind of fun to see the boys again, too. Remember, Bruce, it must be certified.
Yes --- and that's putting it mildly! No certified check -- no story -- Get me?
Believe me, Bruce, I know what I'm doing. He'd get you in a crap game --
I believe in you, Norville -- At least I believe in your... intentions --
...You do?
Don't turn away! Look at it! You're in this too don't you see, don't you see? You're in this too, Father.
No you didn't. You didn't even ask about Billy.
...Certain people are --
Look, it's not your fault, okay? It's me. It's my fault--you just married the wrong person.
Norville, you can't trust people here like you did in Muncie...
You just don't get it, do you? I - am - really - and - truly - leaving - you.
Ted, you're not listening to me. It's over, finished.
See. There's an example. I don't know whether you're being cute or crazy now.
You don't have to answer everything I say. Just listen to me. Okay?
I can trust my brain.
I don't know whether I'm being sensible or hard on you.
Maybe it's the draft through the door.
I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me.
You're the biggest fibber.
I know you mean well.
Who did he leave with?
You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you.
Once I get in the water but not starting off. By the time I catch up, it's too late.
Maybe. Did you hear him?
Calling for Emilio's macaw. I thought I heard him.
How do you think he got out?
And sold it to Mister LaPlante, the fence, who's now trying to blackmail poor John.
You think I haven't figured it out? Just because the cops aren't on to you yet doesn't mean you're home free. I'm a veteran reporter. I've seen your kind before, the underbelly of crime.
In all that smoke and fire, John had a moment of weakness. He'd been down and out, destitute, living in his car. It was just an impulse, stealing my purse.
Maybe black means you're happy?
It's only black when you're around 'cause you put me in a bad mood.
Really?
Really? I've never been out of Washington except once when I visited this aunt of mine over to Portland. I mean, over at Portland. Ain't it pathetic the way folks talk around here?
You got a girl?
Not me.
That's not what I'm sug--
To make sure she's all right.
Not like this. We were never like this. I want to go over there. After dinner, we can--
I'm telling you. There was something in her voice...
But what if something happens?
Nailed us, hub? The crazy old man and his whore.
Why do they bother him on a day like this?
All my mother does is work. That's how you get to be Spanish.
Cut! Print it! What happens in the next reel? Do I get dragged off screaming to the snake pit?
You got no reason to hit me. I'm getting tired of you and Jaeger pushing me around.
What?
Maybe you've got ideas of your own for the gold. Maybe you've already got things worked out.
Hi.
I was dead, too.
Then this will be five. I suppose you think I'm too drunk to count.
Me neither.
Where are you taking me?
Excuse me.
There's a part of you I really like, but I can't do this anymore. I just can't. This is killing me...
Listen, I don't have any plans-- you want some help?
Oh give it up, Gus. I'm just making conversation.
Gus, have you ever been in love?
What difference does it make? You killed Jake.
Borrow whatever you like.
It sounds hysterical, but Otis just rubbed up against me and I'd kind of like to change into something of yours. You know it could be disaster. He's so allergic. It's terrifying.
Dander. He's allergic. Otis.
"... and may also cause bizarre halucinations".
Antihistamine. For bites.
Nothing about drowsiness.
Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
Nobody yet -- it's all tied up.
Where?
Call your friends in the army. Call someone. Victor is harmless. This is a mistake.
No--an' look what I got for you.
There are people out there from The New Yorker magazine. My God! What would they think?
Alvy, don't! You're using sex to express hostility.
Alvy, what is so fascinating about a group of pituitary cases trying to stuff the ball through a hoop?
Here you are. There's people out there.
You an' me's goin' together--jus' you an' me. We're a-goin' to that dance an' we're a-goin' to jus' set an' watch. If anybody says to come dance--why I'll say you're poorly. But you an' me, we're gonna hear the music an' see the fun.
Hi.
I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you.
Oh, yes. Yes, he was.
You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. Pete. Pete. It's a nice name.
I can't --
I have consciousness, but I am not mortal. Don't you see why I'm going crazy?
Am I really her?
Just stop talkin' to people, Thelma! Stop bein' so open! We're fugitives now. Let's behave that way!
Why not?! What's he got to lose? Other than my life's savings, that is. Shit!
Just past Boise City.
Idaho?
You're right.
Louise? Where are we?
Oklahoma, Thelma. We're crossing into New Mexico.
I always wanted to see New Mexico.
Sorry, I wouldn't have made a joke if --
Now? I don't think so. But I've met him, of course, and we've chatted and I know about you and Marge and Mongi and what an unreliable rat you are. Freddie said you were a rat and I thought to myself now I know why he travels under R.
I've never admitted that to anyone.
The truth is if you've had money your entire life, even if you despise it, which we do -- agreed? -- you're only truly comfortable around other people who have it and despise it.
Catch of the day.
Show me the other one again. I like them both.
I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings.
Yeah. See you later.
Well, sometimes married people just find out they can't live with each other.
What are they about?
No, I'm divorced.
Daddy said it's bad when people get divorced.
Get out of my way.
This is suicide. Go get the police.
Piss off!
Your secretary, huh!
I don't recall.
Guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.
I don't get it.
None taken... but ... do we get to come back? Others of my kind, I mean.
I don't know... I just don't feel right.
Yes - it's about bank safety deposit boxes - I wonder if you might just explain how they work - and maybe even show me round.
Oliver, please. Let's not go on with this. The child's trembling.
Look, Mr. Connell . . . I just can't afford to be without work right now, not even for a day. I've got a mother and two kid sisters to . . .
There's plenty of fruit.
Allow me.
You wouldn't believe this, Walter, but Bruce holds the door open for me.
And when he walks with a lady, he waits for her!
And he takes his hat off when he's with a lady.
Do you want to see some pictures? I kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. How stupid, right?
Well, I'm going to change real quick. I hope you don't mind.
Thanks. So... What do you want to do?
You're gross. See that guy?
Which one?
He gives me a total boner!
Is that alright, Frank?
Hello?
Hi, Frank.
Same as we -- they pray.
You saw my fa... father? When?
Is it their innocence? Their beauty?...
Why young girls, Walter?
What is it?
Do you want us to turn around and go back home? Do you?
What?
You know what I mean? Is this it now? Is this the way we're going to be from now on?
This'll be nice. We haven't seen any of the sights yet. It's history. When I was thirteen I used to love seeing things like this.
Oh boy!
The way you are taming him, it sends chills down my girlish spine and... everywhere else, too.
Take me, darling! Tame your little monkey of love!
Nothing. I guess it's hard to pass on this road.
I have to go to the bathroom.
The ones you built?
Hey Sandy, what were you blowing up out there? Your mom was pretty p.o.'d.
Uh huh...
But what are you going to do?
Yeah, like maybe never.
Where's Doug?
Not coming? What happened?
He's not coming.
Sometime?
He says he's got to stay in Chicago. He says I should visit him sometimes.
Do you want me to go?
From a rich old man who used to be my lover.
Caught some son-of-a-bitch stealing my bike. Used a car jack to blow out my U lock and bent a bunch of spokes. So now I gotta get my wheels fixed.
Now, why can't I find a girlfriend like that? Brings him lunch everyday, thoughtful, sweet, legs from here to there--
No, but I broke a nail giving him a cranium crack and that just sort of wrecks your day, know what I'm saying?
Shame, wastin' a girl like that on a guy, but what're you gonna do?
I'll discuss what's on my mind when I want to. You're not going to keep on running my life the way you want it.
What you want me to want, you mean. What you've decided I ought to have - what you'd want if you were me. But you've never given me anything that -
As far as you're concerned, Susan, I've never wanted anything - I don't want anything now - except what you want.
Oh, I'm sick and tired of you telling me what I must and what I musn't do!
I've got more than a right as far as you're concerned, Susan.
I'm not just your wife, I'm a person all by myself - or I ought to be. I was once. Sometimes you get me to believing I never was.
You're my wife, Susan, and -
Oh, I don't mean the things you've given me - that don't mean anything to you. What's the difference between giving me a bracelet or giving somebody else a hundred thousand dollars for a statue you're going to keep crated up and never look at? It's only money. It doesn't mean anything. You're not really giving anything that belongs to you, that you care about.
I'm going to tell her.
But the poor kid's going crazy. She'd rather know her father was dead than that...
Why not?
What are you going to do?
Yes!
I wanted to apologize for this morning.
When you get outta that school, you come right on back home, y'all gon' have to take this laundry work I done for Miss Boatwright today.
Hi, Dad.
I closed my Christmas club.
Open it.
Wrong. There are rules in this house and you're going to follow them whether you like it or not.
You're kidding with that answer, right?
Shit, John! What the hell were you doing out there?!
You mean to tell me I can't see my own husband?
It's an option.
So, what's on your mind?
Visualize a spare?
You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
Fuck you, you stupid redneck hick!
You heard what Johnny said. No part of the Waterfront'll be safe for you now. Maybe inland the Middle West somewhere a job on a farm... .
Then go ahead go ahead! Go down to the shape-up and get yourself killed, you stupid, pigheaded, son of a What are you trying to prove? With a decisive gesture Terry takes the hook and sticks it through his belt. Then he goes to the wall and lifts Joey's windbreaker from the nail on which it has been hanging. He puts the windbreaker on in a deliberate way, and grins at her as he does so; then he walks to the door with a sense of dignity he has never had before.
Is Kaminski a Communist?
Yes, I was given a few, but I never had time to wear them...
And you look pretty wealthy for a servant of God, wouldn't you say?
I don't remember. Maybe.
I don't know...
Believe me, the last thing I want is for you to get punished.
Why now, Jimmy?
I don't know. It doesn't even matter anymore. I just want you to be happy... It's not that I don't love you either. But Jimmy, your timing couldn't be worse.
That's fine.
Yes, I can.
Benjamin -- where are you?
Well -- do you want to go up first?
I'll go.
What have you been doing since then?
Eight.
What... what are these interviews about?
Like what?
I'm Clementine. Can I borrow a piece of your chicken?
But, I don't know, maybe we're the normal ones, y'know? I mean, what kind of people do well at this stuff?
You did? You liked me?
Enough about me.
What did you use?
Nice to meet you.
Evie has a little something for you.
You won't have any trouble finding it.
They're ubiquitous. What we try to do ... is make them a little less so.
You will?
I hope it brings you luck.
-- I don't care about her. Of course, I was angry. But not with you. The book is yours not mine. I was wrong, what I said about it. I hurt you, didn't I?
It's none of my business what you write. And your job, that's none of my business either. I love you. And I've done everything wrong.
How about the promises we make to our kids? About their future. Do we shrug those off, just that easily?
Oh, come on. I went into this with my eyes open, you know. I knew the bottom could drop out at any time. I'm a working girl, right? You don't think I'm gonna go into a situation like this if I don't think I'm gonna get covered on the back end.
How about something to eat?
John thinks I'm so snotty.
I know, but that's what you like about me.
Why do you have to be with your opposite, why cant similar people be together?
Want some coffee or tea?
I can't go right now.
Sam is working at something for the first time in his life. Once in a while he even talks to me. I want to be around for that.
Good for them.
I heard Julia and John got married.
He's mine?
I told you. You have to be optimistic. Believe in them...
When will he be back?
Where is Rick?
You used to be a much better liar, Sam.
Does he always leave so early?
Play it once, Sam, for old time's sake.
Long. You just got off the train and stayed without knowing anyone there?
I don't mind waiting.
This time of year.
I don't know. I just feel it.
I know. I just do.
No!
I understand. Maybe we'll see each other after the show...
Does it still hurt?
God.
You're not going to abuse them. They're all so sweet.
No, Marty, please...
Okay, I'll tell her.
How... When did you...
No, I give it to someone else first.
I'm looking at you trying to think. Put your face in the mirror. I know I recognize you from somewhere.
He is one of the great poets.
This is the street he walks down every day. When he needs inspiration...
He's writing. Hello?
What's the matter with you boys? Afraid it might rain? If you want to go, I'll cover this end.
What d'you mean?
Aw, why don't you let her alone? She's ill!
I just hope this is still good up there.
Yes?
Oh, Adam,that would be wonderful if you could find a girl. One who's not a mutant...and hopefully comes from Pasadena. Nothing against Valley girls, but in my day anyhow, the girls from Pasadena, I don't know...always just seemed a little nicer.
Here's the shopping list and 3,000 which should take care of everything.
Your father has a few final words for you. You know, he'd fight a buzz saw for you - he loves you so much. We both do.
I want to see Pilgrim.
You are not staying home all day feeling sorry for yourself. You're going to get up and you're going to figure this out.
Is that your version of a pep talk?
Grace, listen to me. Your body is just healing. You have to give the rest of you time as well...
I'm not coming back! That's it! I want to go home!
It's still early. What's your next class?
Fine!
How are you?
McCay knows ?
Oh, no, don't. I love that old house.
Transference!
Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... ...that I am in love with you.
I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities --
Yours?
Daddy!
Mike. I want you to know that I'm pregnant.
You know, there's one thing you didn't tell me about guys.
What?
I'm sorry, too. I... I get these ideas in my head, you know, and I have nothing to do all day but sit around and concoct these intricate scenarios. And then I want to believe it so I don't think I've wasted the whole day. Last week I was convinced you were having an affair with Cynthia, I don't know why.
Poor man. And, for that reason, you want to begin where people end?
What if he was? Do you think he wanted to bring that up again just when you're trying to make a new start?
Erica.
You say that as though it's some awful thing! I never stopped loving Wally!
Please... that's enough. I loved you, too--you know I did.
Please don't...
Please don't make me say it again.
Don't look so glum, Viktor. It's not a death sentence.
I'm sorry. I'm sure it is.
That's the Farren house.
I thought you were with Amy.
The only thing I ever told him about life was, "Keep out of the park after the sun goes down."
But I told her to go with you.
No, this is fine. I was just wondering.
Jenny was supposed to come to my place that night. She called me, asked if she could come over. She and Terry had been -- having some trouble. Lately. I don't know about what. On this occasion, it reached some sort of crisis point.
I just want to go brush my teeth --
You don't want me here --
Where's my dress? I have to go home.
Which part?
It's not what you think.
You think that'll help?
Are you all right?
I think she's starting to suspect something.
I ain't your partner, I'm your manager. I'm managing to get your money out of Mexico, into America, in your hands, and I'm managing to do all this under the nose of the cops. That makes me your manager, and managers get fifteen percent.
I was thinkin' the Del Amo Mall. In the food court.
Well, it's my plan. We're in this together.
That's the idea.
Can you cover that?
Well... is it so urgent?
Don't you fall apart on me. Goddamnit, Thelma. Every time we get in trouble, you go blank or plead insanity or some such shit, and this time... Not this time. Everything's changed now... Now you can do whatever you want, but I'm going to Mexico. I'm going. Are you coming with me?
I... I don't know. I don't know what you're askin' me.
Thelma, I'm going to Mexico. I think I can make it in two and a half days, but I'm going to have to haul ass. Are you up to this? I mean, I have to know. This isn't a game. I'm in deep shit. I gotta know what you're gonna do.
But you think he fools around.
I don't think Darryl is mature enough to conduct an affair.
Do you think Darryl's having an affair?
Why call me?
What do you think I should do?
Merry Christmas yourself, Officer.
It's practically stamped on your forehead.
I didn't mean it! I didn't know what I was signing! You tricked me...!
Huh? Absolutely. Take your time.
Hi, Peggy. God, that Walter Getz	can still dance.
Where's Rache? It's Thursday, we get to be with Rache!
We make mistakes. And we forgive each other. Because we love each other, very m...
Yes! Yes, I say that to you, they were boys! Boy friends of Rose, chat's what they were, and why shouldn't she have boy friends? Do you want her to be unnatural? Don't you think she's human the same way you are yourself? It's the South, that's what it is, the South with its horrible traditions, of slavery and crime and the oppression of women, who are just as good as men and just as human!
You certainly are! She has an awful toothache, look at her jaw, it's all swollen.
You don't understand. You don't know what's going to happen.
Okay, okay, I'm sure that I just...
There are just two things I'm interested in: love and death. For the moment, I have none of the two!
Yeah... There's a lot on TV.
Yeah... I'm just good for left-overs!
Risky business, isn't it?
Oh my goodness... Bobby...
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle. Frank, why don't you and Karl go out in the garage and fix him up a place or play a game or somethin'. Vaughan, you ready to go?
No.
Here, you want some?
Yeah?
Oh, I don't know, I don't really. I don't do it very often, you know, just sort of, er... relaxes me at first.
What? What?
Well, good for you.
What are you doing here?!
Gabriel, let him go --
Gabriel -- !
I wonder if we'll ever see Mary again.
My usual place. On the right side. The first seat.
No, we don't have to say it.
Then who was he?
You're not going anywhere!
Where are you going?
Frances!
Uh-huh. It was wonderful.
I wonder so many things about her now. Why she never told me about you... Funny, when you think there's an answer to everything, you think you know all the answers.
I really think you should talk to him about this.
Do you know how I found out about you? I found one of your letters... it was a nice letter, Sam.
I deserve better than this.
That damned, rusty, radiator, bout burned the skin off my legs each time I passed.
Talk to me about sick. Ain't been right since I moved into that drafty house.
I'm not ready to grow old, Laz. Livin' with you. I feel it. Like I'm one foot in the dirt. Saw it happen to my momma. And that's not gonna happen to me. I got living to do.
Better than what you give.
That's what it is. And that's all it is.
I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
All to pieces!
A man of the Cloth?
Oh please.
Shut the fuck up. I didn't go behind your back.
Doing the right thing. Knowing who you are, inside. Not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course...
She wasn't steering her own course, she was steering yours.
Amen! Amen!
And she'll fight back again. God help me, what have I done.
I don't think we ought to discuss this in front of the children.
And your billing address and the name as it appears on the card?
Of course. Would you like to talk to a girl? I can connect you with a beautiful girl if I can just get your credit card number followed by the expiration date?
Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in? I'll be right down.
You're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really.
Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young.
Colonel who?
Cancer, brain... Brain Cancer?
A new car. We can't afford a new car.
Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
So what are you gonna do tonight, Marty?
I could check your prostate.
Excuse me. 'Things are so confusing for me, Jack. Our life feels too comfortable, too safe, too predict- able. It's a partnership, it's juggling schedules. When I think of playing that out, every day, for the rest of my life...'
George...
Please!... that's not like you.
George, now cut this out.
Oh.
Y'know what? Fine. I guess if we want them to know the truth about who we are there's no quicker way to show them.
Yeah.
Do you mind if I take my new Porsche for a ride?
And that's why you're losing your bet?
What's your problem?
Jesus, she reeks of Laura Ashley. Oh, she's crying. Wittle baby's upset by the big bad book.
You're frightened.
Yes, it is.
The first one was fine.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am.
I'm wise to you, I should have seen it before, you rotten son of a bitch. How is it, huh? How do you like --
It's so cold.
Shall we be all right?
Do you promise? I wouldn't want to die here. I wouldn't want to die in the desert. I've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. Very English. And I know exactly where I want to be buried. In our garden. Where I grew up. With a view of the sea. So promise me you'll come back for you.
What did you forget?
Yes, I am.
I did what she said. I used my words, I told him what I felt, and they...
Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that.
Well, I'm sure as hell not what I thought I was gonna be. I was supposed to have one of those great lives, with everything all laid- out and perfect. I mean, hell -- I was Miss Wichita, for God's sakes. Did I tell you that? You live next door to a real live beauty queen. I still got the tiara. I kept it cause I thought it meant something. I thought it meant I was gonna do something great with my life. I thought it proved I was gonna grow up to be someone.
No I'm not. Look at me. I'm not.
He never says his name.
The things that go on.
I wouldn't have thought you'd be so interested in pigeons.
That was nice of you.
You don't mind yourself at all, do you. Joey used to race pigeons.
Tim, he listens to you. Do you think it's a good idea? Seriously?
Um, because you didn't want to go.
I was worried about the rig. I've got over four years invested in this project.
Four --
You don't trust me?
Just get on the bus.
Like what?
Look, I'm desperate. I'll try anything. But what if you can't snap me out of it?
"Events commonly interpreted as haunting apparitions often result from psychic disharmonies or undigested traumatic ordeals..."
Peggy Sue Kelcher. Or, Peggy Bodell. I'm not sure.
Get on the bus.
Just looking.
How's he doing?
Is he upset?
You look sick if you ask me. I hate to leave you with the dishes and all, but I'm supposed to go to a meeting of the Garden Club this evening. I'll need the car keys.
I was gonna tell you...
Oh, no.
The Cockatoo Inn.
I think you should leave it the way it was. It was good.
Will you give this letter to Michael.
Course he did, he tells everybody who'll listen. That's what he's doin' with this stewardess. He's scheming how he can get it over here.
Let him and that stewardess get that money over here...
You don't have to. I told 'em you're real careful. You never pick up money yourself. You always send someone, and I never know who it is.
Lamar --
No. I don't think you do. The other day, when he came to the cottage, he talked about a lot of things, but Danny Witwer, the man he was supposed to have just killed? He didn't mention him. He didn't say his name even once.
Anne Lively... But I never said she drowned.
You got no reason to do that!
Get out of my way.
How did she know where it was?
Do you love me, Bobby?
Don't you like parties?
If you really want a get up an' leave me, you can read about it in the newsprint.
Bless you, Mac. What would I have done without you?
But... how is he going to breathe?
I wish it could all have been different.
What?
Sam ... we can't outrace them. You'll kill us!
Two years at hard labor, Our Lady of Perpetual Help.
It's an awful thing, let me tell you. My Aunt used to say, "divorce is the sister-in-law of death".
My God... Cal. Is it a --
You see, Rose? Now that's the kind of dress you ought to wear.
Yeah, it's kinda nice.
Well, there's no reason you shouldn't go out, Rose... in moderation.
I don't want to. When I was lyin' there in that hospital bed at death's door I says to myself, I ain't goin' out no more. If I ever get outta this, I'll just stay home.
You look very pretty in it, Rose. Really, you do.
Well, you're real sweet to make it for me. There never was nobody like you. And you don't need to worry, I ain't goin' out no more.
Naturally I think so.
Mr. Carpenter -- this is none of my business, but -- why did that detective come here last night?
Jittery is the word.
He has his homework to keep him occupied.
Hello--
Why?
Yes Mother.
The sheets...
What is it?
Oh, Dear God...
Was the child full term?
Sister Marguerite says you have been sleeping on a bare mattress Sister. Is that true?
Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
What sheets?
Well... Then may you rent me your gear for the day?
Why?
Nick?... I just want to say how sorry I am about Sal and about Merle. How... I know you loved them and I know it's not the same. I mean now.
Maybe... I don't know, if you want to talk --
Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
Just get on with it, Alex.
What? When did you see Josh?!
Josh says this is a really good neighborhood...
Where are we? This is a weird neighborhood...
Nothing. Don't worry, I won't bother you any more.
I just mean it's weird to me... I've never been anywhere near here in my life.
It's a totally normal, average neighborhood!
In whatever way you think I mean.
I don't think you understand how I really feel about you, Seymour.
We waited for you... hours, Jim. You could have telephoned, for God's sake. It's Easter! You promised, Jim.
Well, look at the plus side.
It's ... lovely.
... Mmm-hmmm.
-- uhh-huhh...
Well, there was this one time --
C'mon.
-- I guess I just blocked it out, that's all.
-- Well -- not going in and out, I don't mean just that. Why are you asking me? You went with George longer than I have.
To be quite honest, Mr Denham ... I find the whole idea to be quite reprehensible.
Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
It's already started.
I thought you said 'Be sorry for nothing'.
Excuse me?
Please...Please don't stop me. This is the hardest thing I've ever had to do..
Nothing.
What are you doing?
No. I don't need to take this to be your friend.
No. It's a bit of a madhouse. For some reason a lot of my mother's friends specialise in monologues.
...Whaddo I do?
He's harmless.
He can't hurt anybody. You've got his gun.
The systems integration site.
The gods sent us the machine because they took pity on us.
You sound like Joseph. You think the world ends with the millennium?
What an odd question!
-- of Hadden Industries.
There's nothing much to laugh at.
Did you sleep well?
I didn't know one could sleep so well on a yacht. It lulls you ...
Didn't have to try very hard.
I was just playing ball.
You were trying to make me look bad.
So, how do you know the owner, Mr. Bianchinni?
Let her go, Craig. I mean him."
Don't stand in the way of my actualization as a man, Craig.
Everything felt right for the first time. I need to go back to make sure, then if the feeling is still there. I'm going to speak to Dr. Feldman about sexual reassignment surgery.
Have you got a minute?
Oh no, no. I'm not the marrying kind.
Thanks.
My pleasure.
Five minutes?
We want him to come down, to relax, feel in control again.
Poor boy, has to work so hard.
Where will you be?
Waiting in the apartment next door.
And why not?
Fireworks. Update -- we're con- structing the number '65' on the barge, archers from the State College at New Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it, when it catches fire it will give us the effect of a Viking funeral with none of the morbidity... The Hudson River Authority says, for you, they'll make a special dispensation - of course there'll be an overtime bill for the Poughkeepsie Fire Dept...
Are you going to graduate school?
Do you always drive like this?
I'd love some.
You're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again...? Picasso.
A word of advice about women -- that first hour or so after they kill their boss? Probably not the best time to hit on them.
Yeah.
Your phone number?
He was your friend.
I'd settle for being alive. Really. Alive would be fine.
And I think I'm going to.
Three foot one.
Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
I have a friend you might like to meet.
Look, Carol, maybe Walter's done you a big favor. You always said you wanted to get out of town. Go for it. And be happy, goddamnit, I'm rooting for you.
What a I going to do for the rest of my life? I don't have a boyfriend anymore.
Welcome to the singles' scene.
Hi. Donna Irving?
...Yeah.
Sorry. These fountain pens are so tricky.
You've said that already.
I like yella teeth.
They get some turnout for this stuff.
What you don't know about women is a lot.
I like parts of it, but I don't really get it.
Stop asking everyone.
Fifty-seven.
No, dear, of course not. He's a very nice man. I Just think he might prefer to be left alone. Now you get to bed and forget about it. 'Night, darling.
Did you and Mr. Carpenter really go to see Professor Barnhardt?
What do you mean, dear?
Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter.
Why should I submit?
You think I should just because there's no reason?
Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... The book's closed.
You never ask a spook a question. No point. He'll never give you a straight answer. General Y still thinks of himself of the handsome young warrior who loved this country but loved the concept of war more.
Swell's here, Johnny. Bodhi always knows.
I've seen that kamikaze look, Johnny. You've got it. And Bodhi can smell it a mile away. He'll take you to the edge... and past it. Hey, Bodhi.
Why?
Bunch of goddamn adrenaline junkies. I hope you're not buying into this banzai-bullshit like the rest of Bodhi's moonies.
Good. I'm good. Did you finish that paper for Worth's class yet?
I'm okay. Go back to your friends.
I'm very pleased to meet you, Uncle Louis.
Longer.
Why, the directors are waiting for you in the board room.
Why - well, I
Are you just making that up to make me feel better?
No, thanks. The fellows in the office may get the wrong idea how I found out.
Yes, nurse.
What's the difference?
But you were with me.
Hello?
There was no other choice.
If you knew how many times I wanted to hear you say that...
Scottie...
I didn't say that. You did.
Your Majesty.
Jabez -- how can you let her talk like that when the boy is present? He won't respect me any more.
He lied to me again.
That's why you waited for me.
Especially when I play the lead.
Entertaining.
Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you.
It'll just take a moment.
Do you have a minute -- ?
I think it be a better idea if you and Thomas go out, because otherwise she's gonna start a fight with you, and everybody's gonna be yelling.
What do you think?
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best? Proteus for speaking, Valentine for looks.
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. But it has pictures. I mean it's a regular paper, you know.
Above the bed? Any... anything else? What do you you see, something different? What is it?
A wastepaper basket.
What else?
Was it Sister Marguerite who knew about the baby? Alright Agnes, I want you to see your room as you saw it on that night.
My bed.
Who?
Sister Marguerite I think.
What is it?
Someone's following me.
Ahhh!
'Tis but thy name that is my enemy; Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot, Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! What's in a name? that which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet; So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd, Retain that dear perfection which he owes Without that title. O Romeo, doff thy name, And for that name which is no part of thee Take all myself.
Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
Jack? What was that?
Jack, wait...
Yes.
Hello!
Humans.
Got an A, Mum!
Oh, the Chronicle would consider it dirt cheap.
I can't just let him stand by the door...
Think for a second. Is there someplace she said she wanted to go?
Wow, that's soon --
Johana Cross, pleased to meet you. Well! Isn't this a coincidence. I really wasn't expecting this... All the way out here. It's incredible!
Because it's my job. Because people are dead. Because of the whole honor and duty thing, make a difference in the world, crap like that. We can do this, Hardy.
You said you owed Styles and now you're gonna turn your back on him?
You did more than try. You cracked Dunbar in less than three minutes, as an investigator you're phenomenal --
I was starting to believe you, you know? That you weren't who everyone said. I guess I was wrong --
But you will.
I'm sorry --
No. She doesn't talk about you anymore.
I just think you used to be bad.
I bet you did lots of bad things.
But it's not funny now.
You and 'Honey'?
All right...Okay...But let's get something straight, right now. I mean, I'm sorry about what happened between you and Joanna, but it's not my problem, understand?
Look, this is nothing personal, but I don't think you can do it.
I mean, what are you going to do about Billy?
What are you going to do?
Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!
I've got enough trouble raising my own kid. I don't need another one. Got it?
Why don't you get off his case?
I've been thinking.
Not right now, I don't mean right now... but eventually...
I'm too old for him. Don't tell my friends.
The night you arrived, Mom asked you if you had a family and you lied, didn't you?
It's awright, Tommy. I wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. I can't read no fault in you.
Tom! They's a whole lot I don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us. They was the time when we was on the lan'. They was a bound'ry to us then. Ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing-- we was the fambly--kinda whole an' clear. But now we ain't clear no more. They ain't nothin' keeps us clear. Al--he's a-hankerin' an' a- jibbitin' to go off on his own. An' Uncle John is just a-draggin' along. Pa's lost his place--he ain't the head no more. We're crackin' up, Tom. They ain't no fambly now. Rosasharn-- --she gonna have her baby, but it ain't gonna have no fambly. I been tryin' to keep her goin' but--Winfiel'-- what's he gonna be, this-a-way? Growin' up wild, an' Ruthie, too-- like animals. Got nothin' to trus'. Don't go Tom. Stay an' help. Help me.
I'm not asking you to stop feeling for those people. But life isn't just death Harry, don't ignore the living, especially your daughter.
Stop hiding Harry, you run Harry. When I first came here, the idea of working with dead people, didn't exactly thrill me, but when I saw a family lived here, I thought, quot;if I'm living without a family, at least I can work with one, and maybe once in a while i'll be invited in for supper. quot;
He still having parties?
I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
No you're not.
What's the problem?
Do you?
Since you've had sex?
He knows where I work.
I need my paycheck.
From day one. I was a breach birth. They tried for hours to turn my little butt around. But I wouldn't let 'em.
It's not that easy. I just got a raise. I need the money.
Did you ask him to come visit?
I been that way ever since.
I'm off.
You don't sound like one hundred percent absolutely sure.
Oh, yes. Here it is.
Here it is, Bruce. One -- two -- three -- four hundred -- and fifty dollars.
Oh -- mother -- she -- I don't know where she went.
No, I was going to give it to her -- but she left hurriedly.
You're talking like a drunk.
Isn't there something you...
Oh, Ben... you look so very sick... my love... you're so pale.
Really?
Are you afraid of anything?
I told him you looked like me.
How'd you get him to say yes?
And he's fine, girl.
He's in college?
This brother from my college.
No.
Mom tell you to do this?
I know...
He will. He has great faith.
Father, I'm right here.
Where is she?
Cole, you're scaring me.
Oh my God.
You can see her?
They?
Can I ask you a question? If he's so troubled, why are you letting him out? What if he does it again? It happens all the time.
What's that, like a P.O. box.
The address Jenny gave me, that wasn't a prison, was it?
Where you get your bank statements.
That's what was estimated.
You're damn right. I'm gonna sick of your imperious bullshit. I never said I was Betty Fucking Crocker. If every time life hits her in the face you want to have a 12 hour talk every third Friday or the month -- go ahead! I have a life!
You mean for you. A 10-year-old girl is coping with the fact that her father is never coming back to live with his family. She sees her father naked with another woman for the first time. And you think it's best for her if every- one pretends it didn't happen? This isn't going to work out.
I was in there in him.
No. I thought it might be uncomfortable for her --
Did you or Luke talk to her about it afterwards?
Forgiveness? For what, exactly?
...a ridiculously expensive and inappropriate item, which her father and I have already told her she is far too young to own. But you apparently want to buy her forgiveness, with...
Luke was in the shower this morning and Annabelle sort of walked in without knocking.
We're there now.
Oh, he was. He told me a magic spell that would make you come.
Nasty.
You were seen parking your car. The demon king waves his wand and I was dispatched to bring you to him. Lucky for you I waited.
Yeah. Burnfield, Pizza and Puke capital of the world.
I'm moving.
As long as it's on their terms. If your work and your private life don't correspond to their specifications you're labelled a dangerous agitator -- with no recourse whatsoever.
I know what you mean - I'll meet you at VINNIES WINE BAR at six if you like. And don't make any plans for this evening...
All the time?
No.
No.
Yeah?
Thanks.
What are you talking about?
I have new respect for some of my kids, meeting the parents they've been dealt--
Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
I'm telling you you can't.
But that's cause he don't know!
What?
"Music for Old People." What does that mean?
What do we do?
What's going on?
Real rain?
Okay. "Dance Music For Old People?"
Nice friend.
What's his name?
Can I take the car?
I forgot my books at school.
Call me.
Where are you going?
But where?
What?
Oh God, I can't believe this.
The speaker . For the movie sound.
Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
You just cuddle. You come to hug... to kiss. You don't come here to watch the movie.
Some guy in a truck -- he waited till I was alone, then he followed me, like, two miles. Jesus, I'm shaking. Get me a beer.
Johnny Cammareri.
You've got to come. You've got to give me away.
Or a cover up! Jesus, Bill, don't you have enough proof of the FBI's complicity now?
That makes it okay?
Sure.
They had a warrant. They went through everything. They would have found it. I swear.
No, Ed -- what with me running for my life, I didn't have time to check those things --
What did you want me to do with it? They were all over the house.
Omigod, I don't be-lieeeeve this! He's gonna like beeeee here!
I don't want you to be mad at Skip...
Pleasantville Marathon?
How dare you stop me doing God's will!
What are you doing?
I've got to go now.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm ... fine.
How's David? How's David? He's terrific, Carl.
We watched his father get dragged away by federal agents. I don't even know how to begin to tell him where you are or when you're coming back... Or if you're coming back.
Tell me what to do, Carl. I need guidance, not a fucking platitude. I'm not bringing a child into the kind of life I grew up with. I won't do it. I want our life back.
Wonderful. What's she like, Brother? What is your impression of her?
Why aren't you at work?
You're looking good, Auggie.
Right. I hear they can be kind of a time-suck.
Sure. What is it with you rich people and your herb-infused juices?
It may be evidence once they get their hands on it, but right now it's only money.
I know it's crazy, Louise, but I just feel like I've got a knack for this shit.
I believe you.
Can I get you a drink?
Hit it.
Sorry!
Sorry!
You remember those lovely people your father used to take care of? I thought I'd buy them some groceries. Oh, Ann, dear, it's a shame, those poor
You're marvelous, Ma. You're just like Father used to be. Do you realize a couple of weeks ago we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?
What's going on?
I had photos of my kids, plus a mug --
Yes. House. More amendments--more changes--and the Bill goes back to the Senate--and waits its turn on the calendar again . The Senate doesn't like what the house did to the Bill. They make more changes. The House doesn't like those changes. Stymie. So they appoint men from each house to go into a huddle called a conference and battle it out. Besides that, all the lobbyists interested give cocktail parties for and against--government departments get in their two cents' worth--cabinet members--budget bureaus--embassies. Finally, if the Bill is alive after all this vivisection, it comes to a vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally arrives. And--nine times out of ten, they vote it down. Are you catching on, Senator?
No.
How long you been doing this?
Well... I'm going to go now.
And the fifty's all gone, huh? Who's the ten for?
The Websters!
What do you mean? Claremont didn't provide them?
And what I love about molecular science is the way it revolutionizes how we have to think. It unifies the entire world on a single level. Everything is completely connected. Sometimes I can really feel it, everything around us, just a small part of a whole. It's really wonderful.
Mostly love, and romance.
Least you can leave.
Would you like to wring my little neck?
--Truman, you're gonna be late!
Get off me!
Oh, he's adorable.
Fine! Get off me!
I accept. Now get out.
I'm not a Puget Deb. I hate that goddamn term!
Yeah. You got the whole story just right.
Please stop it. None of that's true. Goddamnit, I love you. I loved you ever since I met you.
Well, now I feel so much better.
Whose orders were those?
However you got it figured, I didn't kill Sid and Lynette didn't kill him! He killed himself!
Sure, but -- she could still have gotten your side for the record!
...Why don't I just type this up...
Well, I don't know; maybe she does deserve it. Maybe she should've come in to face you man to man.
You motherfucker...you motherfucker.... YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE, WHO THE FUCK ARE YOU? WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?
Dinner, Hubert.
You said it.
What now?
He certainly -- hic -- does!
No. It's strong. But I like it that way.
Maybe you should be.
Yeah. I'm sorry.
Hey.
A little late for that, Scottie. He's asleep. Jack Daniels?
About 4 months old. I'm working in a new style.
...Okay. I'll arrange things with your assignment captain. Marty's a good man, Brian.
Do you know how much I love you?
Not right now, thanks.
But I thought --
Can't we just dump him fast someplace?
Don't be silly. I'll just tell Lester we were smoking a couple of joints. See?
You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders.
Come on, Heathcliff, I'll walk you to the corner.
Nobody thought we'd do this. Nobody really thinks it's going to work, do they?
Synecdoche uses a part to represent a whole- as in " head of cattle", whereas a hyperbole is simple exaggeration like "I could eat a horse."
No, please, not again.
See. It's four in the morning. A walk sounds a little screwy to me, if you don't mind.
Oh, come on in and try not to ruin everything by being you.
Stop it!! Why can't I have a normal boyfriend??? Why? Get out of here. Just a regular boyfriend who doesn't go nuts on me...
Give me an address so I can send your shirt back.
Your leg will be fine. A lot of shrapnel came out - I saved you the pieces.
How are you?
Because I'm a nurse.
Are you remembering more?
Oh, hi. I'm glad you made it. Did you bring anybody?
How come you're not on the job?
You didn't hear me. You were sleeping.
Ow!
Toothache.
What's the matter with you?
You've got some on your face.
Hmm!
What's funny now?
If these sidewalks were kept in condition - instead of the money going to some cheap grafter -
Oh!
You are. You look like you've been making mud pies.
Are we going to win? We have, you know, other tactics, though...
Love that name.
Hey you.
He's asleep. Watch out for that lamp.
Oh my God.
Not the happiest of memories?
Is this the Community Hospital?
I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
Hey, what are you doing here in the middle of the day?
That's ridiculous, so, if you really can't stand someone, then you pretend that you're really crazy about them?
What's the matter?
He's just around the corner.
You can do it.
Oh God oh God Oh God oh God oh God Oh...
During sex.
How would you know sh...
So why are you asking me?
I like talking about it. At least, to you.
...why do you think?
Because it feels really incredibly good.
Prepare these as battering-rams!
I know what I'm doing, so either lend a hand or go back to bed!
Get the car.
Shall we go?
Meet you in the lobby. Okay?
Then I began to listen to what the well-off were saying about the poor now the war had just ended, and the language was much the same as it had been before the first Reform Act. A small minority thought that England was really theirs, they had made it, they owned it. The rest, the wage earners, were foreigners, outsiders intent on wrecking it all.
For two whole weeks, an' there wasn't hardly nobody there to talk to but me. The manager of the place told me it was the off season, an' it must a ben, because other'n me, there was just this 25-year-old kid, DeLyon, that didn't appear to be all there, an' this old married pair next to me that was always hollerin' for quiet. Can you imagine? All you could a heard there was a pin, an' them, hollerin' away...
How is your cold?
Do you think I took some of that money?
What about me?
You're not dying.
Sounds good. How do you know where I live?
Oh, Tom, please.
Andy usually just sends those to the national media. The local press doesn't know what to do with a position paper until UPI and AP tell them anyway.
Have you ever wondered why CBS News has the highest ratings?
I m fine standing, thank you.
You re a long way from home...
I don t smoke. If you could get to the point...
May I ask where you re from, Mr Lamont?
Well, therapy. And one day I realized I was in love with a man who could never love me back. I was living in a fairy tale.
No, it's logical if you think like your father. See, to him, there's only two women: your mother and everyone else.
No dinners, Bertie. Why are you dressed for outdoors?
Because you don't really seem here.
Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast.
You got off easy.
Just you.
We have something for your mother, for Sonny, we have the tie for Fredo and Tom Hagen gets the Reynolds pen...
What time do they expect us?
Front page. Washington Post. Tomorrow.
We are virtually certain it isn't...
Don't you want to know if it's true?
Six thirty -- and he was very much alive.
Yes.
I didn't know that Andrew was dead until Mr. Sattler called me at home that night.
Is that Mrs. Preysing.
I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
How nice -- your daughters?
Clearly.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Lloyd, I love you, okay?
Wait, what do you mean, ten years?
And if you had to guess ...
So why would PG E offer it?
If you're here to fire me, your timing's lousy.
I know. I'm sorry. Do I get to hear what happened anyway?
Between 50 and 400 million, definitely?
Stop it, stop it, stop it.
I don't want a criminal for a boyfriend.
I thought you wouldn't want to spend Christmas Day alone in here.
It's probably easier for you to eat the rice.
Where you coming from?
Are you trying to tell me Terry is too?
Later for you.
For defending my honor this afternoon.
Well, that's good, I have to get the kids off for school. Can I call you in a little while?
No, no... don't say that. Bad word.
Stop!! Enough!! Jesus! You're worse than a parrot!!
No. I don't know what you are, but you're not Scott.
Shit.
Madam will dress now, it is late.
Five minutes, Suzette, come back in five minutes. I'll ring.
Yes, madam Suzette knows all about it.
Good morning, Suzette.
Madam has slept well?
Oh, yes, Suzette.
Which accounts for your percentage. When do I get to meet this dream?
I say let loverboy watch his movie. And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn.
As soon as I met him, you knew I'd say yes. He makes Julia real for me.
Why'd you bring him here?
A kingdom. His utopia. Life without consequence or restriction. He's not even Carl Stargher anymore. He's this... idealized version of himself who can do anything he pleases... Without fear. A horrible primitive ugly thing. I don't want to talk in here.
Then, I'll see you around.
No, we won't. No matter how it begins, it will end in death. Because it always does. Isn't that always how it ends, Harold--in death?
The Carlsons' are here.
Why, do you think?
Would you two excuse me for a moment?
I've got a right to carry a gun if I want to.
Yeah.
God, there's Lester...
Do you want me to sit on your lap?
You really believe that?
Why don't you use the phone downstairs?
I've got to... I've got to tell him where I am.
Libbets? What kind of a name is Libbets?
What?
I'm not sure why I came here. I had kind of decided not to talk to you after... you know.
Oh really?
In ages, I know, me neither.
This is where we are.
Dance with me?
See, you're not that out of touch. You're good.
Big Ed s.
That s where you work.
He did, but... I think I can change his mind.
I've called Liz. They can set me up with a trailer for Pilgrim. I thought we'd stay at motels along the way...
I think it's called silicon. Charlie told me that.
Tell me tha real truth. You can see my friend, can't you?
I told him I'd take his advice. But before I went away I left you that note... I was on my way down the stairs...
You know, I've never been able to figure that out.
Yeah.
Jody he was lying.
Shit!
It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
I guess most people are.
She's a pretty good sort.
What does she do with herself after business hours?
Do you know what this is, Frances?
I ought to know.
I feel like I do.
He's coming?
So he's got this catalogue of women touching themselves? That doesn't make you feel weird?
He's harmless. He just sits around and looks at these tapes. What's the big deal?
What on earth, darling? It took you hours.
What a gyp.
I'm not so sure. My father and I haven't spoken in three years. When my brother called to say my father was having a heart attack, that he'd locked himself in the bathroom, all the way going over I was thinking how I was gonna tell him what a bastard he was. Then when I got up the stairs and we moved him onto the bed, I thought of all these other things I wanted to say.
Don't start.
Jabez!
I am not afraid. Read it!
Well maybe your wife...
Um...
When he woke up, he said we were out of food. He told me to get some from the ship.
... what do you mean? I'm in the ship.
Getting food. We were out of food. what's wrong? You sound mad.
Sort of.
This is J.D. He's a student. We're just givin' him a ride to... to here. Louise said we could bring him here and then he'd have to go. And that's what he's doin'. He's goin'. Aren't you, J.D.?
Oh my God! Jimmy! You... Oh my God! What are you doin' here?
Good answer. Same goes double for me.
Jimmy! Hello, stranger. What in the world are you doin' here?
Hi, Lenny.
-- but you never were much of a tit man --
Watch out, you guys. Beep-beep!
Oh, your kids are so adorable.
Tch. He's such an angry...he's such a depressive. I thought she was moving out!
Frederick didn't come with her.
When does Frederick ever come with her?
Oh, Hannah!
But, Kurt, I...
I think I will.
Laura.
And are they going to get it?
-- ass and legs --
Why did you give up teaching?
Well, I'm hardly Mrs. Leslie Carter whoever she was. In fact, I'm not even much of a success around here particularly after the backfire on Jerry's little publicity stunt with the leopard.
That was a calamity!
Fourteen.
What are you talking about? I don't understand all this mumbo jumbo and the funny looks on your faces.
I heard how you talked to him.
No.
Man?
I still think we should have met them first.
Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
Could I?
Could I talk to you for a second?
How did it go at the bank?
Came on back. Let me show you where it fits in.
Are you kidding? Because I think it's good.
Want to finish my hamburger? I only took a bite.
Feel okay?
Well, what about artificial insemination?
It was definitely the high point of the evening.
What d'you mean?
But I would like to see you again.
Not here, Duff.
We should pick up a bottle of tequila on the way. I owe you one.
Imagine my relief. So what's for dinner?
Hold your applause. We're not having fun, here.
You took a fishing trip with the boys. Liked it so much, you took another.
Never send a boy to do a woman's job. With me, we can do it in seven.
How?
Things do change.
Thanks a lot.
It's not a combination lock. It takes a key. He keeps it on him all the time. I mean all the time. It scratches up against me when we do it.
She did it.
You don't look nothin' like me, mister.
What about the wedding?
So we'll pick up the car, we'll make the plane in plenty of time.
What time is it?
Hungry?
No, Harry, I can't --
I just wanted to be part of something... one thing, one play or one movie, something that was really fine... memorable. And I could say: I did that, I made something good.
He's a little unhappy. I hope he wasn't a nuisance?
What's that?
Stop it, Artie, will you? Where have you been keeping your- self? I've got the most wonderful news for you.
I don't think. I leave that to God. I'm nothing in all this, I'm just the messenger.
She's a girl of so many interests.
... Why?
I had no idea you were even here.
Oh, George ...
Why no. She's still on her date with Biff ... is something the matter?
I thought you were going to be late-
I'd like to spend a night with you in a bed.
This is work.
Moving in?
I'm always working.
Come on in.
Did you read ALL these books?
Thomas?
You ain't from Oz. Oz is in that movie.
You're not from around here, are you? Where you from?
It doesn't matter, Levi. We're going to find those bodies and when we do, I'm going to make sure one of them has a bullet in them that matches your weapon --
You and Dunbar got your stories straight. Little details, little inconsistencies, designed to bounce us back from one of you to the other, asking questions, killing time, until the transport arrives and whisks you away to where Senator Daddy can protect you. You think you're just going to slide out of this? You're an accessory to murder, Levi, you're going to jail --
Good idea.
Has he said when he'll finish?
That's Leland, isn't it?
It isn't finished?
He used to work fast - didn't he, Mr. Bernstein?
I know. Put Scott through college.
I don't buy them anymore. You were the only one who drank them.
Well, today's Saturday and it's still not here.
I'm still waiting for the mortgage check.
What am I going to do with you?
Why?
Charlie. About last nights..
Danny, I'm trying to -- save you.
OK, OK. Ms. Ivy to the rescue. Now where do I find your brittle bride?
Hold it. You never said anything about a wife, frozen or otherwise-
Trust me. Vegetable magnetism.
You leave Batman and Robin to me.
Why should I?
He has to go.
It's not.
Pinta likes him too much. She thinks of him as a father.
Creasy.
Well, you obviously don't know me.
I'm nervous, too.
Hey, Joel --
What is wrong with you?
There you go again. You're nothing but false notes.
What are you hiding, Danny?
You think you're the only one down here with a sad story?
The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
Yeah.
Mother!
Bullshit. Who is it? You met someone.
The thing is, Joel, whatever it is you think you have with this chick, once the thrill wears off, you're just going to be Joel with the same fucking problems.
What?
Don't say "we" when you mean "you."
No goodbye. No fuck you. No 'Are you in love with George?'
But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it...
Wouldn't go that far.
Hello.
So you're coming tonight, right?
The Challenger exploded. Principal Kelly's about to make an announcement.
Where?
About who?
Think, John. Why would they set you up?
Oh -- don't forget tomorrow we have dinner with Wade Cooksey.
Good morning, Lieutenant - Sorry.
One loud scream will bring them in here instantly. You won't get very far. Think it over.
My security people are right next door.
They're studying with Cynics.
Athenians...
You once said the reason I beat you was because you wanted me to.
No, you don't. Trust me.
Forget it, really. I'll survive.
One of you would end up dead.
Thank you for at least sounding sincere.
It does seem too good to be true, doesn't it, Mr. Bernstein?
I pity us, Dad. I pity us both.
Yes.
Do you want to take a session?
We offer Female Wrestling, that is, nude body to body contact, with a girl of your choice in a private room. Twenty dollars a half hour, thirty dollars hour. Any other arrangements may be discussed in the privacy of your room. Tipping is permitted. We accept Bank Americard, Master Charge and American Express.
No, no thanks.
I know exactly what you mean.
Mm-mm... Mm-mm...
No! All you've done is try to break my spirit, try to turn me into you! But I'm not you, mother, and I never will be, and thank god for it! That goes for you too! And frankly, I don't know how, with the two of you, I turned out as sane as I am -- Wait right there, gentlemen, I'll be with you in a minute... and believe me, I don't want to stay here one second longer than I have to! But I've got to tell you, Lillian, that one day before you die, you will realize what you've done and hang your head in shame. In shame!
What else don't I know about, Joe? Let's get really clear here.
Give her a cold washcloth to suck on -- I gotta go -- there's a clean one in that bag -- I'll check back in a bit. Sorry. My kid --
You're really something Coco...thank you.
Not really. I met her in junior college and she was from this other town.
Is everything all right? Is it bad for you that I'm here?
You have no right here!
No, you listen. Get out!
I still can't square the psycho smarts of whoever did Iris with those two cops.
H'm?
That's, uh... that's pretty serious stuff there.
Yeah?
Yeah?
M'hm.
No, Dwayne, you go ahead and relax, have a six pack and fall asleep in front of the TV, and come upstairs and pass out. And do it all over again tomorrow!
How did I look?
And you never even suspected? Never saw us behaving in any unusual way together?
And after that?
Do you remember anything else? What I was wearing? Was I standing close to him? Was I leaning against his car like I owned it? How did he look at me when I giggled? Tell me everything.
Yeah.
So you're a one-girl guy?
I was just being agreeable, now I've got to explain why?
Yes, of course, we --
How did you meet her?
How long did you live here with your wife?
Son?
Why didn't it work out?
It's all about you, isn't it? Soothe me, save me, love me --
Oh honey. It's spun.
I just heard.
25 years... that's a long time... Are you still in love with your wife?
You're probably just having a mid- life crisis. Did you buy a Porche?
Two years.
My husband's here for work-he's a photographer- and I just came along...I'm not really doing anything right now, and we have some friends who live here.
And -- and --
And then --?
Why do you look at me like that?
Certainly.
Yes -- tired...
Are your parents alive?
I'm used to you...
Goodbye. Thanks for the lift.
By the way, if you ever go past the Wyatt ranch, have another talk with Elaine.
Why don't you?
You got any change?
Go away.
I'm looking at you -- you murderer!
Louie, where'd it happen? I'm going out!
What am I going to say to Bruce? What'll I tell him?
I killed her. I'm responsible. Oh- h... what can I do now? How can I ever face him? Oh, I hope he never comes back!
I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.
I will NOT.
How do you know that?
Or maybe sit out by the pool an' get myself nice an' tan for you. Would you like that?
Yes, of course, Dr. Lester.
I was, wasn't I? I was John fucking Malkovich! Take me back, Craig.
I have to go back, Craig. Being inside did something to me. All of a sudden everything made sense. I knew who I was.
I do appreciate the interest you've taken, though.
You're my father.
IT'S YOUR GIRLFRIEND, BIG GUY, OPEN UP.
Fine. How was the match? Did you loose?
You can't kill me yet.
I could be lying.
Bobby, don't talk like that...
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you if that's the impression you got.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.
If I were to tell you "no it isn't..."
Wonderful. When your next book is published, maybe you could come into the store and do a signing. I'm sure we could get a lot of people to show up.
...you're such a puzzle. So sweet with me and so...contemptuous of everyone else.
I don't want to hear it anymore.
Mister Brooks has had shows in New York, Jeff. He's been reviewed in Art Forum. I think he knows.
I'm just gonna go. I figure the worst I can do is starve to death.
Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
If you get lonely, go down and see Mrs. Romari. I told her you were staying with me.
That's the problem.
Despite you.
You never really trusted me.
What are you doing home?
Gort? But he's a robot. I mean -- without you, what could he do?
I think it went on rather too long.
Where is the meeting going to be?
It's only a few blocks to Barnhardt's.
It's going to be fine. It's going to be ... you remember in 88, when...
Oh, yes, that's right. Did you see the new play?
What are you doing here? You're supposed to be in Palermo.
You're too late. Say bye-bye birdie.
Out. I don't know where. I was waiting up for my husband.
Yes, I do.
So are you... But they'll believe you.... Lina Moebius is saying the whole thing was your idea. That you proposed it in a meeting at her house. Ah, Jesus, Danny... What were you thinking? Are you glad Manzetti's dead? Do you really want to kill Jews? You want to kill me?
You're telling me you killed him? You? Killed him? Bullshit. What kind of gun did you use?
All right, what if all along you were actually infiltrating the Nazis -- to expose them....
Genetic repair mechanisms in eukaryotic organisms.
What's wrong with that?
Why?
There's this girl, this friend of mine from work that I think is really cute and really cool and I want you to meet her so I was thinking about bringing her to the party tonight.
I'm not really asking you, I'm telling you.
She's my friend and you should meet her. You'd like her.
You lose!
It's a free country, we can look at you if we want to.
Jackie.
Yeah.
But I like it I guess.
I'm married, Ishmael. It isn't right for us to be alone. People will t...
Oh right. The Spiderman incident.
With what?
Yes. Yes it is.
What happened...?
Maybe. I said maybe. What I mean is, ah...I don't think it'll really work out, but Charley seems to want it, so...
Easy enough.
Teddy was killed last night.
It was a hate crime.
Then tell me. Where are your sheets?
Oh, wonderful!
Oh Soph, Joe loves kids. Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids.
It's a crematorium.
Liz'll give you a lift. She knows where to go and everything... I don't have time to talk, Rob. I've got too much to do.
Well good. Thank God.
Sophia! I'm not even pregnant!
Oh honey, let's.
Let's go in the kitchen and spy on everyone.
Well, are you sure about this baby thing? It's not the ticking clock shit, is it?
What do you mean, thank God?
No. They don't know him. And Ken liked you. Rob, Ken didn't die for your benefit, you know. It's like everybody's a supporting actor in the film of your life story.
I will willingly swear to tell you what I am allowed to tell you, but as to the rest, even if you threaten to cut off my head, I still won't tell you.
Wouldn't it be just the same, darling, if daddy dropped the present at Mrs. Farren's on his way to town tomorrow morning?
Sure.
No, Virginia, I know how you feel.
She's right. She's right. Young husband and wife, they should have their own home. And my sister Catherine, she's my sister, but I gotta admit, she's an old goat. And plenty-a times in my life, I feel like throwing the milk bottle at her myself. And I tell you now, as far as I'm concerned, if Catherine wantsa come live here with me and Marty, it's all right with me.
My son will be all right. If he isn't, I'll have you killed.
You know who I work for.
Roy? He's always crying.
So what's your story today?
Go ahead. Get in training for the pioneer life. I'm finding the nearest body of water and climbing into it.
We might as well start a fire.
As a matter of fact, I'm out of cash myself.
You think life is some kind of ocean voyage and you start out with buntin' and hollerin' and high hopes, but the damn ship goes down before you ever reach the other side. Luke?
What are you doin' here?
Well, I don't know, I just wash my hands of it, I guess I just got to love you and let go.
Oh, I had me some high old times. Yore old man, Luke, wasn't much for stickin' around, but damn it he made me laugh.
I ain't askin' what you'll do after you get out, because I'm gonna be dead and it don't matter.
With Ram n it's ... pride. I spoke out of the bitterness in me. And he was hurt.
That's the door.
I don't care if I never get home.
You rest. I'll get it...
How long does it take?
Subway.
It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
Yeah. Lavender and old lace!
A big, rich slob like D. B. Norton buys a paper and forty heads are chopped off!
Yeah. You, too? Oh, Joe . . . oh, I'm sorry darling . . . why don't we tear the building down!
I just think we oughta call this relationship quits!
I guess we won't.
Hi.
Oh, Jabez.
Now what?
I'm sorry.
I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
What are you shooting for?
No. No. He didn't mean anything by it at all...
You feel nothing?
Here.
Juliet!
They care about you. They're just a different generation.
It was on your shirt!
Listen, I gotta go. I'll take the deposit to the bank but I'll do the books tomorrow. I gotta go.
Eh, you were miserable this morning! We got bad reviews, terrible ratings, the sponsors are furious...
A flare?
I want to be alone --
Grusinskaya... Oh -- oh if you knew how I slaved and slaved for Grusinskaya -- for the success of Grusinskaya -- for the triumph of Grusinskaya... and what is she now? Just someone who has found that on the day success ceases life ceases -- Are you listening to me -- Do you understand? -- I want you to understand.
You could love me. It is so long since I have heard that word. Nobody has loved me for a long time. It is so icy-cold to be famous. One is so cruelly alone. How is it that you -- Let me look at you. Your hands. Your eyes. Why could you love me?
I want to be alone.
I think you must go now -- the key is on the floor.
Then why the hell do we watch all the time?
Well, it's funny! Whatta want from me?
It happens to be a beautiful love story. Ya know, you used to like that about me. You used to say you liked that I didn't make you think so much. That we could be together and not think...
It's actually a very beautiful thing, and look there wouldn't have been a Vada.
How old are you?
Uh unh. I won't do it.
Believe me, some day, you'll feel differently.
Oh, that's probably Thomas J, I don't wanna see him. It's not fair. Nothing happens to boys.
'82.
I just want the key to my jewelry, and I want you to let me go.
"-- going over and over in my mind every detail, every moment of our time together and I ask myself, "What happened to me in Madison County?" I struggle to put it together in a way that allows me to continue knowing we're on separate roads. But then I look through the lens of my camera, and you're there. I start to write an article and I find myself writing it to you. It's clear to me now we have been moving towards each other, towards those four days, all our lives --
How can you be so casual??!
I think it's very sensible in the circumstances.
Ms. President, this is communist paranoia right out of War of the Worlds. There is no reason whatsoever to believe the ETIs intentions are hostile. We pose no threat to them -- it would be like us going out of our way to destroy microbes on a beach in Africa.
Have you told your family?
And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
Yes.
You're NOT DYING!
Mr. Hadden, I'm a scientist; I don't make deals... But. If you wish to give me, in good faith, access to your information, I can assure you that I will exert all reasonable efforts to promote your cause wherever it doesn't conflict with the best interests of science... or my better judgment.
Keep Ben's for awhile, okay? Until he's old enough to not open them all at once.
No...
OK.
Ben?
then why did you marry her -
Tell me about your wife...
How's your star?
Yep. N'it's for sale. One of the few things money can buy.
Would you like to see it? I've got the key back at my store...
...what...?
Annabelle pick up the phone.
Why don't you say hello?
That doesn't bother me.
Is there anything else?
You think this is funny?
No. I think it's ugly.
NIGGER, FUCK ME HARD!!!...
Okay, listen, just get the custom's office to send me a copy as fast as possible. We can't send you new equipment until our file is complete. Okay?
You've made me a happy insurance person.
I'm not upset. I will never play with those girls. I only surround myself with people who I find intellectually stimulating.
Please make sure it does not happen again.
What are you DOING here ?
In ten words or less?
I'm building a larger one to see the nucleus of Haley's Comet --
How'd you know I wouldn't?
What's that gun doing in your room? Suppose I phoned the police and told them there's a bloke staying in my hotel who's planning to shoot somebody?
What's that supposed to mean?
To chocolate?
How deluded can you be? There's no why...
Tomorrow, 6 AM. Here. If you're a minute late I'm gone. And Stud... I didn't take you to raise. I can show you a few things but after that you're on your own. That'll be four fifty.
Stop here. Do you agree to do exactly what I say when I say it?
Well, I don't know. He sits arounna house alla time. You know a place he can go where he can find a bride?
It wasn't you. It wasn't personal...
I hope not. It's a terrible thing to be dropped on your head.
He coming home right now.
She was here, you know, Wednesday, and I said, "Catherine, my sister..."
Well, I don't know what you want me to do, Virginia. If you want me, I'll go talk to her tonight.
But not a good tired.
May I?
Jack, these are quite good! Really, they are.
Oh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly!
...the rules of conduct determined by a culture at a...
I don't know, I thought it might be kind of fun, you know what I mean, it'd be nice to meet some new people.
Oh, gosh.
Oh.
Oh yes. She thinks you like policing because you think you're right about everything. And you're the only one who can do anything. And that when you drink a lot of beer you say things like none of the other police would know a crook from a... um... bag of elbows.
Ay me!
This is me, Mike. There's nothing else...
I'm talking about I've been talking this way for sixteen years and now, out of the blue, it's vulgar!
Jesus, Mike, somebody's been feeding you a line of crap.
They called here after you left...
Do I want to be crunched?
Ted, do you love him?
Ted, when we got married it was because I was twenty-seven years old and I thought I should get married and...when I had Billy it was because I thought I should have a baby...and I guess all I did was mess up my life and your life and--
You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
I want to be fair-minded, Nicky.
I've been talking to a prominent divorce lawyer.
Who's knows. My Aunt Marge used to say, "some matches are made in heaven, some are made in hell and some are made in hardware stores".
Your father said you might be here.
Because of what you are going to tell him. You have to make it as real as you can. The moment you open the door with the Scotch in your hand, you will be covered, and that moment is the most important moment in the plan.
I've been looking for you because I want to let you know what's been going on before you read about it in a gossip column.
He has his own submarine. I'll be getting everything that matters. I'll get New York and I'll get Connecticut.
You stay inside. I will see to them.
If you want to tell me.
She has a fish bone caught in her throat. Could all of you go in the other room? Gideon, get some bread and toast it quickly and find me the cod liver oil.
Is that your driver?
Maybe this is what you've always been, Craig, you just never faced it before.
You guys are playing music?
Your guitar is named Kimber?
That's all right. My axe is named Roosevelt. After Franklin, not Ted. Franklin was the hot one with the polio.
I am a suicide risk.
Shall I tell my sisters that we oppose marriage?
He says... he says I must be good... and help everyone... and take care of myself. Do you think he's coming from the sky?
Why does he call you that?
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests?
Go out! Where?
Don't you trust me?
We have to go back.
Like what a fraud he was.
What about me?
I suppose I got really into wine originally through my ex-husband. He had a big, kind of show-off cellar. But then I found out that I have a really sharp palate, and the more I drank, the more I liked what it made me think about.
Yeah.
Pony, oh my god!
Oh, yah?
Hey!
And you're at this third stage
You might think -- I thought so myself at first -- that Burgel's too insignificant to be dangerous. But that's the very reason to beware! It's the small men to watch out for -- the ones who substitute method for character.
I never said that.
About what?
Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
Last night. He came to see me at my apartment.
Makes no difference. Get him out.
Yeah.
Of course not. Does he look lost to you? BENNNNN!!!
You're a good salesman -- but I've got to think about it.
You know how I feel, Tom. I just want to think it over.
It was a wonderful day.
You know you've had a strange day... I'd sleep on all these things you've been thinking.
He's a good kid. A salesman.
No. I told you. I like apple butter not butter butter.
Oh, thanks, Bobo.
Gee, I better not, if it's okay. I still gotta drive back up to Los Ang-gleez.
Ugh!
Good. They're all heatseekers! All of them, everybody. You keep one superstar and they'll all follow. There's no real loyalty, and the first person who told me that, Jerry Maguire, was you.
Well, it worked, and I will not let you fail. You are Jerry Ma- fuckin-guire.
I hate it.
Are you okay?
Okay.
I don't see how we can.
It was after you, baby. After you.
Yes.
I don't know.
All I can find out about the Williams' is their tax returns are classified and that Bill Williams, a descendant of the Cabots of Massachusetts, has links through his family and United Fruit to the CIA and does classified work for Bell Helicopter which requires a security clearance - so what is Oswald, a defector, doing visiting his wife in his house? Williams has a relationship at Bell with General Walter Dornberger, another one of the Nazis we brought in after the War for our missile program. He used slave labor to build the V-2 Rockets for Hitler before Bell needed him.
Willow. To learn magic, first you must make your own philosopher's stone!
Hey, no kidding? In color?
See, ya.
Oh, stop that! God! Listen, I know you like me. I can tell. But you know what? A lot of guys like me. Not me, exactly. It's more like the legs or the butt or the hair. Or some combination of the above.
The eyes. Okay. An eye-man. Anyhow, it never works out. Okay? Not that you even need to know that! You look like crap, by the way. What have you been doing?
What?
I'll be in touch.
Shut up, you.
I'm really glad you two found each other.
N-no. He... he beat him up. He was making him... answer questions... and beating him up... and then... Ned just died. Little Bill didn't mean to kill him... he said he was sorry an' all... but he said it was a good example anyhow.
Little Bill. The... the Bar T boys caught him and Little Bill...
He's... he's dead.
They... they killed him. I... thought you know that. I thought you knew because...
Oh no, I, I...eh...I couldn't.
Well maybe for you.
Well let's just say you're lucky you deal with children who are under anesthesia.
Go to your room. And you...I don't suppose your father gave you permission to pierce your ears, did he?
Well just don't shave your legs...he'll never let you visit us again if I send you home hairless and full of holes.
What?
You're actually gonna bail Sketchy out.
It's all right.
Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look.
I love you.
Daniel! ... I've stood just about as much as I can bear!
Jesus, Daniel. It wasn't Ryker's Island. It was work camp for white collar criminals.
Everyhing go off all right?
Mmm. This is nice. I always loved the way you kiss. I missed you.
It already is.
You're pretty charming when you want to be.
Come on, let's dance.
Do you miss her?
I guess I should be flattered.
In the garage.
What was my mama like?
He's stubborn as a Stone.
Jabez, don't you remember your own wedding? We said it's for better or worse. We said it's for richer or poorer.
You can't do this to me. It could ruin me.
Let me out, Truman. You're not right in the head. You want to destroy yourself, you do it on your own!
He treated me as if I were a child...
The minute I read that script I said...
Can't I stay a little longer?
Fishing. Look, Jimmy... I need you to help me. This is serious. I'm in trouble and I need you to help me. Can you do that?
No, I'm out of town. I'm in... I'm in real deep shit, Jimmy. Deep shit Arkansas.
Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it. Can you help me?
I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it. I need that money. Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back? Please, I'm desperate.
You never did answer my question.
How did I get in the house? How did I get into my bed?
Position the long-bows over there, crossbows over there -- and set up Dijon Culverins either side of those trees...
We return to Orleans... across the bridge, at the Tourelles.
The English are rebuilding it.
And what's the title of this seduc... assault?
Really, Mr. Clurman, you don't have to sell me.
After dad passed on, Mum's agenda was to hit the town and find another husband with a boatload of cash. INT. LONDON APARTMENT -- EVENING Sophie is dolled up for a night on the town... CLEAVAGE spilling out of her cocktail dress. Domino is feeding her pet GOLDFISH. "THUNDERBIRDS" plays on the television.
Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
You have some marker, that's what I think, if you want to know the truth. You have some marker and you're going to put it on the house keys so that Janey can find them and then when I get back to the house I'll find the two of you in there and Wendy'll be able to hear you and Paul will be back and he'll hear you and I'll catch you, that's what I think. She'll be swearing and banging against the wall and I'll catch --
Well, I'm really pleased to hear a confession.
Thanks for the diagnosis, Ben. Thank you. So let's just go to this fiasco if that's what you want to do. Let's just go on in. I'd rather talk to anyone else but you.
Quincy...
No I'm not.
I told you, George. I'm not going.
I got caught in the storm. You were gone all night too.
I told you where I was.
It's not for me; it's for my kids. You're the only one I trust them with.
Hello, Jabez -- Here's your son.
Before I forget, your father has papers in the basement I'd like you to go through. I wouldn't know what's important.
Well, clearly you don't. But I'm not the mystery you're trying to solve right now.
I know it's not easy. Just remember, he didn't choose to be your father and you didn't choose to be his son. You just ended up together. You could pick numbers out of a dark bag and it'd be just the same. If you ask me, it's a wonder parents and children can stand each other at all.
Yes, you both think William Bloom is a very smart man. The problem is, you only see me as your mother, and not as someone's wife. And I've been his wife longer than I've been your mother. You can't discount that.
No it's not. It's exactly the same. Your father and I met, we dated, and we married -- we chose each other -- because we understood each other on some fundamental level. Just the same as you two.
I'm sorry about last night. Please forgive me.
Yes, very much so.
Occasionally, but always with affection.
I know. I keep asking myself what I could have done to prevent all this from happening.
Goodbye, dear.
What?
Mama, vos sos bien antigua. Como lo va a matar con un picahielo. Eso era en su tiempo, estamos casi ya en los ochenta. El lo va a meter un tiro, lo va a volar, le va a hechar un hijueputa carro encima.
Don't explain, Sidney... It doesn't matter now...
Why?
...nothing...
What did Albania ever do to us?
Where?
Yes, yes, and definitely yes. Also... I get confused.
No, not really. They're about the same. My marriage was one long headache.
I don't know if I mentioned the headaches.
Is that like a party trick?
I know how alone you feel... alone in all that cold blackness... but I'm there in the dark with you, Bud you're not alone...
Not in my world.
Eh... yes...
No... The closest...
I'd love to have a baby. But I can't...
I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way.
I know that. But the buses don't go there.
That is the general idea, yes...
This is good stuff, Jack, keep it coming...
Thanks, Jack...
I'm listening. I'm getting better.
Are you kidding?... I've got so much on Andy, it isn't funny.
I'm not playing any games! Go look at Lynette's!
Why'd he do it?
So?
So I'll get a fair shot?
Across the board, sir.
Same rules for everyone, sir.
What're you doing out of uniform, Sid? You don't want to get in trouble.
What happened?--Was Meurice there?
...What do you mean?
Well... what happened?
Hello.
Yeah. It was an unusual place to be.
I'm going over to Aaron's. Maybe I'll hoop up with all of you later. How long do you think you'll be there?
What?
It wasn't like that.

Why Picton?
Is it so bad? It would be quick. He wouldn't even have to feel it.
What are you talking about?
John, please--
Does he know a Captain McGann? The boy hears this, whispers to Oliver.
We'd have to kill him.
So?
Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
Yes, she would.
I hate all that fuss. But I'll do it on one condition -- that you're there to give me away.
You've been around.
Where you coming from?
Anybody hurt?
Okay, ya know. Okay.
Yah, yah, course I remember. How are ya? What time is it?
No, that's okay.
Yah.
Yah, that's me.
Hmmmm, interesting.
Come on, it's fun.
Never mind.
You have no personality.
Yes.
We can always do that, Duff.
They won't.
You will.
I'm nervous.
Bu-ud ... Mary Sue ... Your breakfast is getting cold.
Why?
Why?
That would have been quite a coincidence.
Well, I don't go to the Plaza every night.
That's very romantic. Some of your fares must be interesting. See any stars, politicians, deliver any babies yet?
What hours do you work?
You mean you work seventy-two hours a week.
But you never had a first date.
She must have been in a good mood when she said that. She usually calls me loud.
You want me to leave?
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister. Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.
She still is.
Why are you sorry? I just said hi.
It doesn't mean anything. It was written before I went out there. Before the ho.
What about the letter?
I'm going to run back to Walter's arms, if he's still have me.
So he can't write. Big deal. I mean, verbal ability is a highly overrated thing in a guy, and our pathetic need for it is what gets us into so much trouble.
Made for each other.
Somebody told you.
I am dubious, but I don't welsh. Meet me at The Stuck Pig. Seven o'clock. You're late, I walk. So help me, if I find out you cheated.
Who told you?
Who told you?
Is it this aisle or the next one over?
Aye. He's a good lad. That's why I ask you, MacFarlane.
Aye --
No, it isn't. Because it isn't everything. And we want every- thing, don't we?
I'll explain everything later.
Well did you or didn't you?
Cortez, see if you can dig out the tools without losing the rest of out gear. Try a wrench on that thing.
Nick...
They're truck drivers.
We're gonna get out of here, Nick. We're gonna get out of this...
Oh, yeah, that's really nice of you.
No bodies, no West...
How much?
I have been waiting for this ever since.
Victor!
Nine!
Hey, pal. I don't know about you, but where I come from there's a little girl's room and a little boy's room and the little boys don't go where the little girls go.
Nine.
Your name's Harlan? I got an uncle named Harlan!
Nah.
No. I saw her with Tod.
Joanne?
Got any parts? I'm free. Not free- free, but, you know, free. I don't really do this.
And then, just before it got so bad that he had to be committed, he said that he could...
I couldn't tell if they were real memories or just phantoms. You know, he might only have thought he actually remembered them...
When he was around your age... almost exactly your age. He said he figured out a trick to remember the past.
Why do you ask?
... That's what he's here for, isn't he?
Okay.
Tell him I said "hi".
You're joking.
Who will?
I want your life for a minute where my big problem is someone offers me a free convertible so I can get out of this city.
Well, almost ... unfortunately I do have to punch in by 5.00 every day.
Well hi Vanessa! What brings you to the mall today?
Happy? Oh, you mean like, physically. I'm good. Look, I have a snooze button now!
Oh, okay. So... how are you feeling?
Please excuse Leah. She's mentally challenged.
No...
They're starlings.
There's little chicks! You want to see?
I don't like starlings.
Eddie... A guilty client's not the end of the world...
She hasn't actually done anything...
Yes, sir.
Oh. Right. I'll call him.
Well, we must see a lot of you, Senator. Come, Father.
How nice.
I'm afraid we won't have room in the car, Father. Senator Smith can follow with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.
Don't say that!
I know, but sometimes...
That's five hundred dollars.
Five hundred.
I was wearing that dress the day I lost my virginity.
Why do you even want it? It would look stupid on you.
Don't you want it?
This whole place?
Why not?
Thank you honey. are you sure you don't want it?
But, Sidney darling, the man must be out of his mind - it was only eleven o'clock in the morning!
I don't know - it's a big apartment. But I wasn't interviewed. In fact, I was totally unprepared for what happened.
In his apartment -
Do you think you could do something, Sidney?
Can't that wait, Hubert?
I don't know.
This isn't a home, it's the crossroads of the world!
She's quite cute you know. Young supple breasts, a tight firm ass and an uncharted pootie.
I need you to seduce our young Cecile. Introduce her to your world of decadence and debauchery.
I don't find this very funny,
How come you're not at Sal's?
I'm in here.
Sal's gonna be mad.
Is this another one of your patented two-hour lunches?
I think no such a thing. Sal pays you, you should work.
It's obvious you're not a woman.
Well, I have more than a few days, ha, ha... I uh... I'm sort of... not an editor anymore... right now... First time I've said it out loud.
I don't thinks you'd want me tripping all over you in front of everybody.
Even if I wanted to - as you say - be less humble, blow my own horn... how would I do it? I'm less than nobody.
How long we going to keep this up.
Hey, where did you go? We were worried about you.
She did that before.
Yeah. I know. She did that before.
Hello Tom. You're off? What are your plans?
Joe, you look absolutely divine. Turn around!
Come here!
Come on!
I don't like those studs they've sent. I want you to have pearls. Nice big pearls.
I didn't think they'd really do it.
That Kid... he's just a... boy. And that other one, Bill, being true to his wife...
I was teamed ten years with the best in the business. Cole Langley.
It is, Roy! And now, right now, it's the perfect time, the best time since I've been in the game.
You're from out of town?
Bye.
She'll be all right baby.
Okay...bye daddy, I love you.
I was looking forward to this evening.
This is Captain McGann.
Thank you. Thank you.
No, I can't go, but if it, if you weren't offended, it would be very good of you to allow us - every other cabin is crammed. This is as private as we'll get.
You've got a mustache.
Do you really want me to?
Can I take off my clothes now?
I don't.
Do you want to hear it or not?
I got up.
I got up. I ate breakfast and went shopping. During the afternoon I read a novel.
See food!
Uh huh, why?
Hey Shelly, like seafood?
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the grub, yay God.
Talk it through: Childs, Mueller, and Nunez know they're going out on the regular Tuesday Night drill, hurricane or no hurricane, so they plan it: Kill West, pin it on Pike.
Why didn't you tell us all this in the first place?
Where's the cabin?
Dunbar.
Go back inside! This is none of your business! I don't have to take your shit all the time anymore.
You know, you two are wonderful parents. I'm really going to try to behave myself.
Still stuck on her, huh.
Can I ask you a personal question?
You got a girl-friend?
Where do we go -- my place or yours?
Poor Mickey -- when I think of him all by himself in that jail in Havana -- -- want to see his picture?
You're not well.
There'd never be a hole big enough. Now took at me, for instance, when I was just one person, before Bobby, I had so much garbage collectin' onto me every day, I was thinkin' about gettin a dispose all...
I regret we have no servants to show you out, Herr Salieri. Respect my wish and go.
This is not his handwriting.
He's not going to work on this anymore. It is making him ill. Please.
I want you to look for Jacqueline.
And you knew he'd be here.
At least you knew about Dr. Judd.
No.
Holly.
tried him once -
What for?
She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit. Trust me on this.
Forget her.
Destiny? You living in a perfume commercial? She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride.
Cut it out, Tran.
You know, I saw you guys once. You and Frank. At the Roosevelt.
Yeah, they got a convention for everything. At least he was clean. Boy, the guys I met when I was with the service, you wouldn't believe. The older ones, they were okay. Nice. Polite. Pulled the chair out for you. But the younger ones ... Mama used to say, dance with a man once, but if you can feel calluses on his fingers, don't dance with him again. She thought she had it all figured out. But she wasn't so smart. There are killers with palms like a baby.
Soap convention.
Your advice!
No?
Where are we ?
This is to be a very important picture. I have written it myself. Took me years.
How long is a movie script these days? I mean, how many pages?
And you have written pictures, haven't you?
Everybody has a great body now.
Oh God, Patrick. Why Price? Price?
Everybody's good-looking, Patrick.
How's your brother?
They could clean around the arrangement.
...Oh Barton, I feel so... sorry for him!
When was the last time you cleaned this place?
No, sometimes he just... well, he thinks about Estelle. His wife still lives in Fayettesville. She's... disturbed.
Barton. Empathy requires... understanding.
I see. ... Say, would you mind seeing our family doctor?
Yes. My husband has been very ill. His doctor and nurses are staying with us. Those hospitals can be so impersonal - why, it might be hours before you are treated...
Fine, it will save a lot of unnecessary fuss and it will be so much more pleasant for you... David, we'll just go on home. Jeffrey, would you call and let them know?
Would you care for a drink?
Oh? Certainly...
You are, silly. He's a bad sheriff.
Quit it, Tommy. Evan gets to be Robin Hood. I'm gonna be Maid Marian, and you're the Sheriff of Nottingham!
Evan, guess what? Dad got a new video camera and we're all gonna be in a movie.
Is he here in Borderdale?
Yes.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
She talked him into it. She wanted everything.
You can't be an 'us' just when you want to. You can't play that card when it's convenient.
No. You think this is going to help the kids then you do it. You're on your own.
The great thing about life is that things keep changing.
What happened to them?
Well, then, sit down.
Honey, he's engaged. And for the first time in my professional life, I'm a part of something I believe in.
Don't you like her?
Where... do those men come from, George?
Africa? That's so far? How do they get here?
We gotta lay something out, strategy- wise. Somethin' tight. Y'go in there ad-libbing, it's y'ass.
Landon. I can't even do for myself.
Yes.
Capture them? Well, I've never seen anything like it, so... of course I'm curious.
Jus' keep doin' y'damage girl, keep these mafuckas off my as--
I DON'T KNOW!
He's okay isn't he?
Don't just stand there, get help!
He's coming over.
Yeah? Well, fuck you. Sorry doesn't feed my kids.
Look Mr Denham - you're not welcome here. Just pack up your cameras and go.
Bleeker told me Katrina's whole house reeks of soup!
Oh, it totally does. I was there for her birthday about four years ago and it was like Lipton Landing. But you know, boys have endured worse things for nookie.
Wow, someone's been actually doing her geometry homework for once!
I don't have a choice. Keith's been grading me really hard lately.
Please do not refer to Mr. Conyers as "Keith," okay? My barf reflex is already heightened these days.
Keith's hot.
Did you hear Bleek is going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Katrina? Pfft, no way. He doesn't like Katrina. It must be a pity date.
He asked her. I heard they were going to Benihana, then the prom, then to Vijay's parents' cabin.
Oh yeah. Charlie. How am I going to handle him?
Anything you didn't understand?
No, Doofus... blow it out!
Are you okay?
Yeah, I guess... call me...
You can open your eyes now.
What is that?
In Europe, Louis. We shall meet our own kind. Find the one who made him. Learn what it means.
The swamp...
Should we burn him? Bury him? What would he have liked, Louis?
Don't mock me, Louis. Help me.
Mama, that wasn't Marie, that was me!
Marie's dead Mama.
How do you survive?
I... I'm Martha, Mama.
Well that's a lot of land. You must have help. Do you have field hands that help you?
It could have been - fifteen years ago. It's my part now.
After all you've said... don't you know the part was written for Margo?
"Cora" is my part. You've got to tell Lloyd it's for me.
You talk just as Addison said you did.
Addison wants me to play it.
I don't think anything in the world could make me say that.
That won't be necessary. Addison knows how Margo happen to miss that performance - how I happened to know she'd miss it in time to call him and notify every paper in town... ... it's quite a story. Addison could make quite a thing of it - imagine how snide and vicious he could get and still write nothing but the truth. I had a time persuading him... ... you'd better sit down. You look a bit wobbly. If I play "Cora," Addison will never tell what happened - in or out of print. A simple exchange of favors. And I'm so happy I can do something for you - at long last... Your friendship with Margo - your deep, close friendship - what would happen to it, do you think, if she knew the chap trick you'd played on her - for my benefit? And you and Lloyd - how long, even in the Theater, before people forgot what happened - and trusted you again? No... it would be so much easier on everyone concerned, if I were to play "Cora." And so much better theater, too...
Over my dead body...
I'd do much more - for a part that good.
A part in a play. You'd do all that - just for a part in a play.
Washed away.
Yeah. No, no! No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
Here. Sit down! Quiet, egghead! All right, now, a serious expression.
Good night.
I love you, too.
Is this crazy?
No. That's the weirdest part about it.
Hello.
Egypt.
Whether or not I'm going.
I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
When can I talk to you?
Maybe he's wet?
No, but I think they might.
Stop it, you two!
Go home, Adam. Go to your hotel.
What class?
You don't know, do you? You're blissfully ignorant, aren't you?
Calls himself Dodd.
No!
Wants to know what happened to Jimmy. And his money. He thinks I have it. He thinks I took it.
Do you like being a cop, Bud?
So you saved her.
It doesn't matter. All they get is Veronica Lake. You got the real Lynn Margaret Bracken... Where'd this come from?
I was tired.
Don't bring that up. Like a different girlfriend would'd've let you die?
No way. You have this -- destiny.
Didn't you visit the campus?
Ha ha ha. Hoo hoo hoo.
I know.
Are you going to talk to me, or shall I get my paper out?
Right.
What are you going to talk to me about?
I'm sorry. But two days ago you were in love with that girl who interviewed you for The Reader, weren't you?
It's covered, okay? I appreciate your concern. Can I talk to her?
I don't know what to do, Walter.
Don't remind me. That's how we happened to --
That's all right, Walter. It's as much my fault as yours.
Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But -- I guess I can't, Walter.
Yeah. I suppose I could. But, Walter --
Eddie, what's my motivation?
Yes. And I also want to leave this city.
The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
What is it?
That something I shouldn't see?
Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
Annabelle, I know you miss your mother. So why don't you say hello.
You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
The problem is I don't happen to think my son should be spending all his time with a man who carried a gun under his coat and goes around whacking people.
Heaven.
Can I help you, sir?
Eighteen-- and a half.
Sir?
No you're not You're glad, because now you've got a witness. I heard the other police talking last night. They don't seem to like you very much.
Think about it. Okay?
I need a partner, Roy. I need an inside man, and you're it. You could be as wonderful as Cole.
Join up with you! I watched you, Roy, I've been watching you, wondering if I should talk about this at all, or maybe just...
I see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me.
Why do guys do such stupid things?
I can't! I can't put him in the pot. I can't put a live thing in hot water.
Uh-huh.
Peter, let go of the chair!
When's your birthday?
Your 33rd birthday. The transformation will be a perversion of Christ's rising from the dead. Townsend discovered it in one of Lareaux's books.
It'll happen at the exact time of your birth.
Now and then. He gets drunk a few times a year.
We don't.
No we don't.
About five years.
No.
Oooh! Here! Here!
God, you smell like whiskey.
No, I guess not.
You mean it?
There certainly is I There certainly is! Aw, to hell with you!
Of being found out. Of not being a genius
We've known each other too long, Orson. Sling the bullshit elsewhere.
Don't insult me with your cute press quotes Save it for Louella.
Goddamn it. I gotta have some kinda life!
Mickey, Mickey, listen, listen.
In-in-in-instead of the child molestation sketch, why don't we repeat the Cardinal Spellman Ronald Reagan homosexual dance number?
Yeah?
But the peyote is obviously affecting their brains. It's made them break a migratory pattern that goes back thousands of years.
Virgil, you wiener! You never could stand up to fight. You--
Oh, shut up, Buddy.
Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio.
Are you going to get your degree soon?
More history, Rose.
What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer?
Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola?
It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff.
But I only had sex with Telly.
I tested positive?
No, I didn't. I said, "Will it change my life," Alvy.
Are you sure all her signatures are real? It's not easy to get all those signatures.
And what are you doing following me around for, anyway?
Of course it's a good idea... it's our plan.
I don't know - I'm not sure it's a good idea.
I'm sorry about the other day. I don't know what's wrong with me... I really do want to move in with you.
I need to talk to you.
Please let me come with you. Please please please...
I don't know... I was thinking maybe I should live alone. I decided to rent that place we looked at. I'm moving in next week.
Hello?
I can treat him any way I want to - I'm an adult! Leave me alone!
You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
Haven't you heard what I said?
They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
No!
You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
I'm sorry.
Good morning.
wasn't even thinking about-
Don't come any closer.
I was one of those silent, listening children. Glued to the shadows.
That's for sure.
Don't look good for "Trial of the Heart."
Hello.
There's something wrong with your car, you said.
We did all the proper things, and we lost love. That's sad, Mac.
... Good night, Chauncey.
Yes... I know, Chauncey.
He does...?
Better times.
They'll be paid for by a great admirer or yours who wishes to remain anon - anonymous.
My name is Lorl, sir. I'm a maidservant. I was asked to come here and offer my services to you.
Are you Herr Mozart?
She won't talk to me. She says she has to speak to you.
And that's how Felicity came into the picture. During one of those two seconds.
It fizzled, baby. That's the way it goes. But we had our times, didn't we? It wasn't all bad.
Who the hell knows? He dropped out of sight fifteen years ago.
But I'm going to give it up for adoption. I already found the perfect people.
Oh, God...
Do you need a large sum of money? Legal counsel?
Hon, did you get expelled?
Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra?
How are we going to do all this?
I don't know, Booth.
When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
Come on... let's find you something to wear.
What's the matter with you?
Yeah. His band is playing a set.
What do you do?
That woman was a student of yours?
There's old saying my mother told me. Would you like to hear it?
I flinched.
That's not doubt. That's four hundred years of science fighting a billion years of instinct. I always wondered what you religious types did with your free time.
Shut up. I'm rich. I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars.
I can not tell you.
For as long as you'll let me.
I shall want you for always.
You wouldn't understand. I come from great darkness and deep peace
But where is that?
For always, then. Only you must promise never to tell anyone about me
Not even Daddy...or Mommy?
To my audition.
Wally Brown.
Thanks Coco. I'll let you know.
Get going. You don't want to be late.
Right. See ya.
Good luck, honey!
I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping. What's it for but to buy us anything we want.
Are you afraid for me? Where I'm going.
Honey --!
You're a mistake.
I'm not mistake, I'm here aren't I. How can I be a mistake if I'm really here. God doesn't make mistakes, you're a mistake...
Are you intelligent?
Yes I am.
Agnes, you're stupid.
No I'm not.
Are you pretty?
Yes.
Oh Agnes, oh Agnes, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright, I love you.
Do you really love me or are you just saying that?
Hi Loretta.
I guess I didn't look. You know I don't pay attention to those things...
Karen and I just don't want an accident-
It's not important whether you do. We are wearing long underwear.
Do you mind. This is like the most important moment of my whole life.
Lemme see that.
Well, what about it? Let them see him! We'll go them one better. They can also hear him. You own a radio station, Mr. Norton. Why not put him on the air?
No, no. Not at my hotel. I, uh, I have things to do in the city before I leave. I'll meet you at the station, huh?
That's too far ahead to plan.
Oh, darling!
I love you so much, and I hate this war so much. Oh, it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away, I mean, if, if something should keep us apart, wherever they put you and wherever I'll be, I want you to know...
Okay... but just...just to see.
Well, Bruce -- I don't think -- that would be possible.
Yes, Bruce -- I'm here --
No, I'll tell him. What am I going to tell him?
I wish you'd...
... When you dive... with that machine... What does it feel like?
GET OUT!
Get out of here.
What in the world would do that?
We just want --
That was kid gloves?
Put your guns on the table... If we wanted you dead, you would no longer be drawing breath in Miami. We wouldn't have brought you all the way here.
It's a simple subject.
I'll be ready.
My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast.
I want to stay.
It's the rough-cut, the other side's new commercial.
Ha! Where's that?
That sounds fine.
Oh, God! Here yuh go! Oh, good, now he'll think- Aaaah! Okay.
Oh, all right. All right! It's all right. Here.
What's happened to you?
See, now this doesn't feel right. When I made the decision to come over here it felt right. I had all these rationalizations... I just don't understand why Will never tells me anything, he won't let me get close to him, he tells me these weird lies--
I guess so.
Why is she leaving me?
Do you think the "Enquirer" shouldn't have campaigned against the oil leases?
How 'you gonna live?
No.
Don't eat the red ones.
I don't want to be responsible for his food. Just a small green salad. And a Perrier.
I could help with the debate.
A debate. Man's inhumanity to woman. He's pro women. I'm con. Ms. Flannery is twisted.
Detective, does it look like a murder?
What's Thursd...
Is she saying this in Albanian...?
It will be fun meeting Gregory every night at the station.
What d'you expect?
It will all be over in such a little while, Jacqueline, and everything will be all right again. Drink your coffee.
You'd love that, Jackie. Remember that last summer with Mother in the Berkshires? You used to help the gardener.
Will you call me?
We can meet for another drink if you want. So I can explain it better. I owe you that much.
You must have known it would happen. You couldn't have been entirely unprepared. Like you said, I've been living with the guy. We were bound to get around to it sometime.
And anyway, I keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it? The point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, Rob... Are you there? What are you thinking?
The house - Tommi - something just doesn't jive here...
Well of course they're me! That's how God talks to me. If you listen hard enough, even you can hear him. Everyone can hear him.
It's not time yet. My mission is not over yet. There is still more I must do before I can really -- finally -- go home.
No.
They've abandoned me... like everyone.
So... what am I supposed to do now?
All of it.
It's just a feeling. Don't you sense it, too?
Oh. Run.
If she comes down here, so help me I'm gonna mash her brains in. Everything in your life was sunlight and roses until you met her. Since then, forget it.
Did I say a thing against her? God forbid I should say anything against that fat cunt.
What'll you do? Come out.
I know you wouldn't need Leon if Heidi was treating you right. The thing I don't understand is why you come out and sleep with Heidi anyway? You got two kids on welfare now. What're you goin' to bed with her, you don't have enough with one wife and two kids on welfare, you want a wife and three kids on welfare?
Dr. William E. B. Dubois.
Fuck you.
It's always closed...
We still have to go in there sometime.
Fuck you, bitch!
Did you have to buy new hair dye or did you still have some left over from eighth grade?
Let's go hassle Josh.
Where are we going?
I bet they have tons of incredible shoes hidden in the back.
There he is...
"Hassle"?
I called you a taxi.
Oh, but I am!
What thought is that?
Don't toy with me, Doctor.
It's beyond perversity. That honor should carry a price tag...
Why don't you sit and I'll read you something he said.
Brumby.
What do you mean, how'd I get in? I pushed the door and walked in. What do you think?
You really do believe in destiny?
Don't worry. He's meeting the architects at the restaurant.
Mulholland Drive.
He won't. He thinks I'm simple.
Okay. That's good. I just wanted to make sure.
Hell, you know, Coca-Cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. I guess that's how come they stay number one.
You know, Mr. M., when I win the presidency, that means you and I are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. And I for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. Wouldn't you?
I'm hungry, J.F.
We scared each other pretty good didn't we?
I was hoping you'd say that.
I'm just in one of my moods. You know how I get.
Hey.
You don't gotta get up but... I gotta go...
I think if I just piss... I'll be okay.
Okay look, this like--wasn't my fault. They asked me what it was about and I like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, But I told them what I DID remember, and the next thing I knew the pages had filled in.
Keeps going ...
But like only up to the part about the raft, because I didn't read any farther.
You can't fucking say something like that and say you don't want to talk about it!
You're not ready.
No. I want to have a baby. I have to have a baby.
Joel, We're fucking gonna talk about it!
What?!
Engaging.
A little drastic maybe?
What?
Alla puttanesca.
Just tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault? Her mother's fault?
I think kids get bored and have intercourse. And I think Junebug was a dummy about it. But we have to move on from here and help her figure it out.
I'm not ready to be a Pop-Pop.
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.
I have no idea what kind of girl I am.
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop. And Juno's not going to be a ma. Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation. I friggin' hope.
Did you see it coming when she sat us down here?
He was just doing his job.
I don't need pity. I need a paycheck. And I've looked, but when you've spent the last six years raising babies, it's real hard to convince someone to give you a job that pays worth a damn. So I figure, since you're the one who said I was gonna be okay, you should be the one to hire me.
As the Old Mill goes around...
Of course.
I understand...
Metaxonycha Godmani.
No. I didn't. I'm listening.
Looks great. It does.
It's not a date. It's co-workers going to a professional conclave.
I'll be on board by noon.
I commute to San Luis Obispo twice a week.
I'm sorry - I didn't think
Well...
Oh yeah. Who cares? I'm the queen of typos. Wow, this is really starting to open up. What do you think?
Can I ask you a personal question?
She's in L.A., he's in the Bay area --
Meaning you didn't like it.
Well, what is it?
Apparently you can control this Malkovich fellow now.
As good as humanly possible.
I can explain about the portal, darling.
Oh shut up. Craig, darling are you in there?
Do you love him?
Can I ask you a question?
Well... You're all right now, I guess. I have to get down to the track.
Well, no, Roy. Your mother found you.
It's beautiful. I've always liked Gibson better than Fender.
But it's not true.
Fine. I'll do the shopping.
She's out there isn't she? She's in the lake.
Don't I, Norman? YOU KEPT THE FUCKING NECKLACE. Of a woman you killed!
Wow, you musta seen some things, huh? What's the worst thing you ever seen?
You must get a lot of overdoses. I bet you picked me up a couple of times.
James is odd. I know he has an aunt in Sewickley Heights. I dropped him there once, but... Come to think of it, it wasn't even his Aunt's house. He said she worked there. Or something. I don't remember.
Will you come in, please?
Please.
I just think you should'a kept him off me, that's all.
Maybe that's where the accident was. There must be a police report. We could call.
That's where I was going... Mulholland Drive.
But they don't have a case against you.
Jake, be careful! What're you doing to the belt?!
Can't you get the money from your friends?
If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me?
What're you... what're you pitching me, here?
You have a strange way about you... I mean interesting. I'm sorry. It's really none of my business. It's just nice to meet a man who talks like that. If David saw that paper, he'd say you're a fag. That's how he is.
It surprises me. It really does.
How long have you lived here?
Normally, I'd say no. Everything's quiet now -- no ships, no divers, no electricity. Makes sense. But what's curious is -- these aren't normal jellyfish.
They have six tentacles. A new species. And the squid too. They had no stomach.
What?
Yeah, why?
I'm okay.
Oh, nothing much. You know...
Listen to you!! You sound like Mom. What are you talking about?
The police are after him, he's a murderer!
...That's not true.
That's not true!
Something's up wi...
Then don't go to Hollywood.
I do it all the time!
Since our divorce Luke has seen a number of different women in three short years and without a lot of warning for the kids, he's now living with a woman half his age --
Miriam...
Shush.
I don't want to find out.
It could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.
If we reverse the feed and bring Edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. Imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.
He creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.
I've heard this argument before. It's not happening.
...a monstrosity! Who would do that?
And that's one!
You didn't mean it. You didn't think. You'd do anything to take it back.
Looks like a tie.
We'll say it together. On the count of three...One...two...
Huh?
What is your problem?
I'm sure everything'll work out. She really loves you...
Oh, I loved it. I wish you'd gone.
All the time I've known you, you've never once asked about him.
But... he only wrote nine, Major.
No, Uncle; ashes mean penance and death.
Who was next? Clyde? Or was it...?
You know what I mean.
I don't really want to talk about it, to be honest.
I'm sure.
He's at home. Listen, I can't believe he went to the store. I'm mortified, actually. I'm really sorry. He had no right to do that, and I told him so.
Yep. I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.
It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
You're naked.
No, but...
That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
I think some people are meant to be alone. Maybe I was a man in a former life and I used women for pleasure so now I'm paying for it - which would be fine, if I could just remember some of the pleasure parts...
Where are the others?
Did you pass out again, Grady? Did you fall somewhere?
Yes. Just don't say anything mean for a while. Thanks.
I believe you. I believe you want to be with me. But this is not just about me anymore.
Well, thumps like me leave appearance to guys like you.
What do you mean clean?
Don't be dim.
Tonight. Well, you've started a Tempest in a Teapot.
Is it the medicine that's making you thirsty?
I thought you said you didn't have a church wedding.
But, we're all going to Heaven!
How can I convince you to stop?
Makes no difference. Get him out!
He . . .
Him.
I know. I know. You've got the talent. I got the breaks.
Anybody! Er, er Beany'll do!
I am not with the Inquisition.
And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open.
The science of psychiatry.
Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
You have a lovely voice.
No I don't.
Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
Yes.
I just heard you.
That wasn't me.
Jimmy, did you touch her?
It's hardly yesterday; the signal's been traveling for over twenty-six years. As for why... I'm hoping your own expertise in decryption algorithms will help us find out -- to see if there's another message buried deeper in the signal.
Mathematics is the only truly universal language, Senator. We think this may be a beacon -- an announcement to get our attention.
You dropped this.
Well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.
Take us to Vegas. EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY The crew rides in the back of the Wanderer's truck toward Vegas. INT. VEGAS SECURITY LOCKDOWN -- NIGHT Domino stares at Taryn as she returns to the table.
Yeah? And what do you do the rest of the time, live off your trust fund?
Linda. That girl looks just like Pat Benatar.
I know.
No way! He just called him a dick.
God. People exaggerate so much at this school.
It's been a while. Maybe I'm just out of practice.
Why in the hell would you want to watch my kids?
You're gonna die soon with that diet, you know that?
Peter, I believe your baptism was perverted. Look at your certificate. Your mother was the only witness to it. Your blood-type doesn't match who you thought your father was. Peter...I'm sorry.
Right.
Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning.
Is that what you wanted to ask me?
Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
Yes.
Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean it when he said I was beautiful.
Yeah.
What are you guys doin'?
I missed you.
You want some company?
What are you talking about?
Hey, Barry.
Where's Rob?
-- for over twenty years because that's what I was taught -- you stick with it! Normal people don't get divorced. I can't remember the last time my husband made love to me so intensely that he transported me to Europe, for Christ's sake -- quite frankly, I don't think he ever did! And now I find out in between bake sales, my mother was Anais Nin!
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
Please, the children.
You kiss by the book.
How long do you think we'll have to stay here?
Until Pa gets around to driving us to Minden.
Blonde as a new mop. And beautiful as the girl on a feed store calendar.
I tried my best, but these things take time.
And we're running out of that.
There's still tomorrow morning.
King of the Housecalls! Master of the Living Room!
You are not a loser.
I'm sorry. I was on a roll. I meant something else. When do you want to leave?
Let's go. I'll drive you. 45.
What'd you do?
nothing.
I don't know why I keep hoping you'll grow out of this tomboy thing.
I won't. I'm a lesbian.
The coach from Tennessee was there and he has me riding the bench.
I was just showing emotion.
So that means it's alright for you to act like that?
That's not funny
Well, that's what you think, isn't it? Cause I'd rather wear a jersey than an apron...
I've worn some kinky stuff before ...
I could like kill a guy with these things.
So what's the point?
What do you mean?
He-llo? I've got like three pounds of underwire here ...
I think I would like that drink. I'll give you your Christmas present now if you'll give me mine.
She thinks you can. It wouldn't hurt you to find out if you could, would it?
What are you going to give me? I hope I don't like it.
If you tell me to relax, I'm gonna kick your fucking head off --
There are no ghosts, Ellie. I want you to go to sleep and forget all this nonsense.
He's a ghost. But he's a good ghost.
They have to clear all the local roads of mines. That's a big job. They won't stay in the house. They're putting up their tent in the garden.
Who is this Paxcow? Is he like the boogeyman?
Paxcow says Daddy's going to do something really bad. He--
Okay...
Honey, what is it? Just tell me.
Cute, Virgil.
I am running faster!!
My mood ring! It fell off! I gotta find it!
What do you want it for anyway?
Are you crazy, you'll get stung!!
Milo! What about --?
Damn you! What did you do that for? He can't prove anything.
Can you see the balloon man?
God, you're so obnoxious! Our work happens to be of great anthropological value!
Kings and sixes.
Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
What for?
Put it on my account, please.
A wife?
Yes. I didn't mean to sleep so long. I was afraid I'd have an accident last night, from sleepiness... so I decided to pull over...
Goddammit, Hardy, you can't just leave --
No, no! I'm sorry! What is it?
I got this dress at a thrift store for one dollar.
Oh. Hell. And what do we do now? What do we do now? Boy Producer? Mister Win-an-Emmy, Social Conscience, Whaleshit, save- the-rainforest, Liberal hire-a-convict shithead? Mister Affirmative-Action Peacnik. Commie... shithead....?
Ain't no new Negroes in this town I don't know about. What she look like? You sure that wasn't Denver?
Might see anything at all at 124.
You sure?
Better ask Paul D.
No reason you should, no reason you should.
John . . .
They charge extry at the comp'ny store but they ain't no other place.
Well, tomorra you'll get in a full day--full day's pay--an' we'll have plenty.
I sing now?
No dances, just tell me.
Hey, it's legit. Strictly dinner and dance.
Billy, that girl couldn't have pulled you in there forcibly...
All I wanted was an honest chance. And If I couldn't get it, I couldn't stay.
No shortage of suspects.
Maybe. Though it didn't seem like he was getting any satisfaction out of it. Almost like... Did I say he was class officer?
The hostages, but that was a naturally-occuring... It was a put-up job? But where was the, where was the money in that?
...the Yellow Ribbon, but who, who'd profit from that...
...where is the Back End coming from?
The thing with the Yellow Ribbon...
Yeah, he told you. Think. What was Barnes doing before they cut that cable loose? He was on the phone. Except that cable is a thousand feet long, Norman. They would've broken off communication with us four, five minutes before they cleared out.
And I guess we didn't talk about money. So, I'll just dive in --
So who was Barnes talking to at the last minute? Nobody.
I'm not sure. I've never seen anything like it.
... He lied to us. He left us down here.
Fuck you, Norman! It's right here...
No no, I know --
I brought a few of my own.
Since seventh grade.
So I know this is a bad time, but -- you will have a medical program, right?
My favorite aunt is hearing impaired. He said "you complete me." 40.
I've killed my husband!
Jesus, if you're glib about this I'm going to lose it. I was up all night and...
Why? Are you a sex fiend?
No.
How important do you think sex is?
Neither am I.
We're just alike. You think sex is so unimportant you don't do it. I think sex is so unimportant I don't care who I do it with.
How long... how long I been out?
Two days?
Well...
I have to talk to you.
It's jus' till we get some distance. Then you can come out.
I know, but that's enough.
All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
No.
Holy cow!
Walter, there's something I have to tell you --
Then don't.
It gets worse.
We know all that we need to know --
I'm sorry --
What was it like?
I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
I'm sorry.
No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
No, I don't. He happens to deserve the credit. He's right here.
Aaron should be hearing this so I have an extra witness.
I'm still asking myself--what is he-- animal, vegetable, or mineral? A Senator! A United States Senator! I thought I'd seen everything but-- why, he doesn't know what time it is, Diz! When I think of myself sitting around--playing straight for all that phoney, patriotic chatter-- me , carrying bibs for an infant with little flags in his fists--no, I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I quit!
Moi?
You want to talk about the baby don't you?
Yes.
You've been alone together?
At least once a week.
Often?
Oh, yes.
And you like that?
In the confessional.
She was afraid you'd make a big deal out of it.
Drew told me.
Will you relax? I know it is a big deal day --
Yeah. I guess so.
I hope so.
...Then don't.
It's beautiful.
This is how you see the sky?
Nice. Where?
That tends to happen when you're the boss's daughter.
Talk? To you? After what you did!
Just being obstinate, sir. I'll handle it.
Perhaps you've got the time for that, Mr. Treves, I certainly don't. I've got an entire hospital to look after, and you have your real patients. Don't waste your time with him sir, it's like talking to a wall. I don't mean to be harsh, but truthfully what can you do for him? I'll be back later for his bath. And Mr. Carr Gomm would like to see you when you have a moment. Good day sir.
Is that not enough?
Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is -- Now you'll have to kill me.
Then they may read about me.
But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli.
You shoot like a girl.
Stranger my foot, it was my grandmother who helped you into this world.
Doesn't it get noisy?
It is. It's very warm. I wonder how long it will last?
What about them?
To you, too?
Neither do I.
I'm sure you underestimate yourself, Eve. You always do. You were about to tell me about Eve...
I just love you in that sweater Mary-Sue. It's so flattering.
I'm sure.
Why, Craig. why?
It's right to the point. Also that it must have sounded so new and fresh to you - so exciting to have the lines read as you wrote them!
Oh nonsense young lady. You're going to start your day with a nice big breakfast.
Actually--I'm not real ... hungry.
Find that plant. Cut out its heart.
Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
Oh my God, the others!
No, the marriage isn't a fiction.
Gabriel!
It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
You told me that I was...
She wants to know who's staying in her apartment.
But I mean isn't he Faith's new--
Hey, isn't that Tran Vo?
No. I haven't noticed because I make my payments. So, Max Pelcher, how's the P.I. business?
Free?
I'm not callin you Big Black Africa. Mommy and Daddy named you Julius.
I order out mostly. So what do I owe this visit to?
Please.
It's just for a night or two, until she finds her own place. I tried to explain that to Aunt Ruth, but the connection was bad and her plane was leaving and she got it all mixed up. I kept telling her it was my friend and she kept saying she didn't know any Ritas ...
Peggy Lee?
You're kidding me.
I'm glad you	did too.
Nick! Nick! There's someone to she you,
No.
To celebrate how masterfully you destroyed Roston today.
Sweetie, look at me straight.
I'm sorry.
None of your business.
I was looking for him earlier, but...
Coco...she's very nice. We went to school together.
Well, the widow Curtis will bring you riches, position, land, even half-grown children. You won't have to do anything at all! You shan't have to do another thing to prove yourself.
Is that the truth? Well, we can't carry on like animals any longer.
George, you know I only love you, but...
And what is this, then? Been off to fight the French because you are a patriot? Or is this you, gaining your long sought after rise in society by becoming victorious in war!?
Not you. Some assholes on the elevator... are these bitches on a permanent smoke break or what? Why the fuck they call'm "working girls."
-- I don't think that's necessary. I think it's perfectly clear. I should have guessed -- it all makes sense now... it's why she never goes anywhere, never seen in public...
You don't drink?
You have anything to drink? You want to go out and get something?
Huh?
You're not a private detective either, are you?
Are you lovesick?
It's not going to come up.
Good, you brought your violin. I want you to play.
From my father. He was the tribe's Shaman.
Them other two, they been takin' advances on the payment.
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. It's called "nesting."
You should read the book. I even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.
Well, I wanted to pick something gender-neutral for now. Once we get the baby, God willing, we can create a more decisive palette.
I think I'm leaning toward Custard in this light. I don't know. I should paint a small area...
And I disagree.
That wall is going to need something. Maybe we could put our first family picture there.
Enjoying your reading?
You have?
The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that?
Ooh. You're gonna give me goose bumps.
In maybe three or four issues.
...so he already had the tattoo that said, "Naomi Forever"... and now they're broken up, see, and he has to have it removed. But while the scar is still healing, or whatever you call it when you have a tattoo removed, he meets Chandra. And it's serious, immediate love. So in no time, he's gone from the most gorgeous model in the world to the most gorgeous actress in North America.
Don't do that thing... ...that shrink thing.
At the block party?
But...who...
Okay, okay... I won't say a word...
Hello.
And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing
Look there are a lot of unanswered questions here.
Thanks...
So whose route is this?
And he's where?
Well, that's our life now, isn't it?
I don't finish till eight. Make it nine and you're on.
What are you doing here? You know the rules.
Haven't you got a conscience of your own?
What do I mean to you? I want to know. Tell me.
Well, that's my poor upbringing. I didn't go to no private school. I haven't got no class. I want to live with a writer. Not a fucking croupier. I don't even know what the word means. Croupier.
No! Not crazy!
Look unimpressed.
Margo.
...Office 2702.
They certainly don't waste much time.
We're having lunch with a movie talent scout.
Nothing definite yet - it's just to have lunch.
You were there? At the play - last night?
What if you can't read what's written on there anymore?
Come on, Jeff.
Yes--
When?
You weren't there. Give me time to get some proof.
Then what are you afraid of?
Then he couldn't have committed those other murders.
The shape doesn't bother me. It's just that goddamn rotten stench.
Hostile and uncooperative.
You knew Sergeant West?
They're watching us now.
Charlie, what do you think of Richard Norvik?
How was it?
Norbert was just beginning practice. A real man would have sold her to a catfood company, I suppose. As far as that goes, J. Edgar Hoover still lives with his mother.
A lot of people don't.
You know she has no feet! You want him to abandon his mother, who has no husband, who has no money of her own, who has no feet?
In a railroad accident many years ago.
You were going without saying goodbye?
Okay, get in to bed.
-- Well no. It never came up.
You said the worm was untreaceable!
Did I kill my mother?
The bees killed Thomas J, and I killed my mother.
He hired you to build this place ?
You're trembling.
You're really a love -- you sure?
Lucky I was there to save you.
Well, water isn't exactly the best thing for pictures... Not even for pictures of dolphins...
If you want.
Well I just don't think we have much to say to each other.
Are you tired of it?
Nothing.
NO!
You are marrying the greatest guy who walks this earth. Who I have loved from my heart for twelveyears!
I'm-I'm okay. Yeah, I-I-I, you know, I...I'm just, um, I got dizzy all of a sudden. I'm-I'm...I have a headache.
And cigarettes. I smoke, too.
No, I don't have time.
What book did you want to buy? ELLIOT What? Book?
Well, you sure picked the right place. I mean, you can stay here all afternoon, not buy anything and just read.
Yeah, sure.
Isn't this great? They have everything here.
Pray. We never find out.
Dead people?
Oh, that's so amazing. I wish I could see it.
Yeah, I'm a nurse's aide at Mercy.
A cloud?
Oh.
No, I, you know, I help 'em out. I empty bedpans and bring 'em lunch. That kind of thing.
...I don't know.
I'm gonna pull it out and I want you to pin it down, okay?
Stop it!
They went out scouting when they saw your fever broke.
On the Bar T... looking for... them.
I have no idea. Are you ready?
Why did your ship land on this planet... on Earth?
You thought we were a different planet?!
Stars... When a sun is far away, we call it a 'star.'
You did? That's funny. So did we.
You know, you've been picking on her ever since she came in here. Now just leave her alone for a while! I'm just suffocating.
It's been weeks since they spoke to me. Since the coronation... no signs... nothing...
You don't think I can grab bulls' balls?
Hey--I can be out of control.
Okay. Remember when they took your office chair in for repairs and forgot to return it?
Yeah.
You stood for like a month.
Are you okay?
Why are you so upset?
It's alright.
I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
I got lost. Oh here ... look at this!
No way.
It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
What's the matter with you, Lee? Why are you so sensitive all of a sudden?
She's sixteen years old, Rob. That's totally and completely illegal.
I'm afraid people around here provide her with quite a bit to gossip about. Take care.
I suppose we'll make an appearance.
Maybe we should go in a different room?
Thank you for showing it to me first. I'll... I'll take care of it. Can I have the picture?
What is it?
I'm sorry, but can it wait til tonight? I'm already late for work --
I'll be waiting.
Here it is; the last chapter.
What?
I gotta find him.
No. I just gotta go find him.
I'm gonna go to jail. I know they're gonna make it look like I did it. They gotta put it on someone.
What do you think I've got? A gun? Maybe I'm gonna kill you too. Maybe I'll blow your head off right now.
Yes.
To show you this. It's a letter from that lawyer, Koehler. He wrote it to me the day after I saw him. He's the one who told me I could get the money if Miss Lawson went to jail.
I'm starting my own collection.
No, I--
Something happened with Marty and Ray--
No, thank you.
It galls you that I know so much about you. You don't have information to compete.
I'm curious about you.
The way you've underestimated Bud White?
Oh yeah?
Is that my -- scenario? Tell me.
He's out of prison?
...Milo?
Where'd you read all that stuff?
Dwayne put the gun down --
You know I do.
Any time, sailor.
Zack, when you're through with a girl, what do you do? Do you say something or do you just... disappear?
What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
It's okay. This kind of thing happens. It's just never happened to me. I'm sorry. It's true though. Mm. So, um, what's your TCB tattoo stand for? What's that about?
Soon.
Do men have sex with each other in that theater?
Gay pornographic movies?
What kind of movies do they show there?
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh, yeah, you're just so smart.
Like your story is over.
How come it feels the same?
There's nothing on the walls. No pictures--
How long have you lived here?
Did you find your father?
Give it back!
Girl with a baby always gets prettier.
-- Can't seem to escape you today.
Petty good.
I don't understand. What about you?
But why my name, Richard?
Oh, this is Betty.
You too, Lieutenant.
Neither do I.
And? Are you going to tell him?
You'll what ?... Come on, Pa. Come on an' whup me. Jus' try it.
But not right away? First the business of fighting them off, chin up, stout fella...
Check.
Very classy stuff, lots of technique-
Not much.
Groom- - may I have a wedding present?
There goes Eve. Eve evil, Little Miss Evil. But the evil that men do - how does it go, groom? Something about the good they leave behind - I played it once in rep in Wilkes Barre...
Copy. And Lundegaard too.
And then I'll see you in New York --
Not for the kind of place I want to do. I won't be in Chicago that long.
Mmmuh...
Josie Grossie.
Oh, some of 'em. But it's mostly just strokes and shit. I mean, most of 'em just sleep all the time and get kind of yellow. Usually they die id they're, you know, really yellow.
Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
Copy.
What a nightmare.
I'm a little worried about the... ...about how much bleeding is okay.
A bit heavy on the powder, isn't she, Jimmy?
You were not baptized. At least I don't believe it was Christian. Your baptism was performed by your uncle, James McKenzie.
How do we explain that?
Gobble, gobble, gobble.
There's the car! There's the car!
He sells guns.
Help you get Ordell Robbie.
If I'm working, I can help you.
'Course I do -- I deliver money for him.
You never asked me if I did or not.
What about the schools?
Okay. ... I love you...
I beg your pardon? MISS OLSEN I'm Miss Olsen -- Mr. Sheldrake's secretary.
Oh, I used to be such a Catholic.
How many of those drinks did you have?
Oh, I got a pimple... This stuff is supposed to blend with my skin color... Like it really works, ya know...
I thought so.
Why not? They seem friendly enough.
Come on, Truman. Haven't you studied enough?
Second thing this week I can't explain.
What kind of machine can bend a stalk of corn over without cracking it?
There are none.
Some animals around the county exhibiting uncharacteristic behavior. Sometimes violent behavior. Theo Henry had two of his fingers bit off by his cow.
Shit!
Did you see that guy?! He was right in the middle of the road!
How long do you think that'll take?
Shit!
About two hundred and fifty miles.
How far are we from Mexico?
Then you'll have to make your own home. Lots of people do.
Then come find me.
Just where I wanna be all Saturd...
I can't help feeling that I'm cheating when I take them.
I don't know...I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
What are you waiting here for? Why don't you go?
Charlie, please don't -
Hello, Brad -
...the better to eat me with, your dear?
...well, we do that anyway...
Happen to know where there's one for sale.
Not without a rolltop desk.
Till she showed herself.
Don't be so upset. It's OK...
I'm not a whore. I'm not a whore.
You don't know. I'm sorry. I was desperate. That's not me. I shot a cop. Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison?
I know. I wouldn't know what to say. If it were you.
Walk in the park. And thanks for the 'we'.
I live or I die.
The camerawork's nice.
You can't talk underwater!
Call the police!!
He's kidnapping me!!!
Help me!!
Help me!!!
So go.
Oh!
Do you want to be questioned about you and Mr. Jimmy? Please, Clayton. It will be better if I find the body alone.
You are right. Yes. We must put him back.
You must leave. You were not here this morning.
The police will not know that. They will want to investigate.
Just hold your water, okay? So Kirkhill, we gonna do this or we gonna talk about it?
Deepcore, Deepcore... this is Cab Three on final approach.
Can I see the map? My father spoke of references to a Beast God ...
And I know that one of them fucked like two other girls, who were both virgins, so I knew he was safe.
And the other person I just fucked, which was a mistake. But I went to the clinic last week with Jennie.
I've known the past of all the people I've fucked without a condom. Like I know one of the people got tested and was negative.
I made her get tested with me because I didn't want to go alone.
Oh, I've got to get a shot of this.
I know it's over, asshole, I --
Bye, Joel.
Hello, Walter. Hi, Louie -- how's the slotmachine king?
Why, I'm surprised, Mr. Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife -- even if she's no longer your wife.
Editorials?
Well, we have to do something about this -- "stuntwoman".
Oh. Right.
Will you please keep your voice down, there's people --
I didn't know it was a secret. There aren't supposed to be secrets between the city and its investigators --
Brian. What's wrong?
It is?
I think it should be outlawed.
Slowed things down? Where have I been? Have we been going fast!?
And he never knew, and the girl kept this bad thing locked in her heart? That would be all right, wouldn't it?
-- Will he keep his word?
Yes, Monsieur.
I'm eleven and a half.
Oh, yes, please.
Don't do it!
Tom was telling me about his trip over. Made me laugh so much I got a nosebleed.
This day just keeps going from bad to worse.
The replicators?
Yes, that is what I was thinking.
Yes, he might be.
Oh, I'm almost back - I'm driving around Moose Lake.
And when I confronted him about his affair with Cecile he told me it was none of my business. Then when I said "Well what about Ronald," he said you were nothing more than a stupid... the n word and that you deserved what you got...
Yah, the loudmouth. So the whole state has it, Lundegaard and Gustafson?
You are. And I'll come again.
Thank you for inviting.
It's not you. He dislikes that you're a Wallace. He just says... the Wallaces don't seem to live for very long.
Do you think J.J. likes Steve...?
Good night.
I've got to see you alone!
Tea would spoil my dinner. One meal a day, I'd hate to spoil it.
That.
Have you seen it?
Dictation. You know...
Just think about it.
Move in with me.
I think it's a fucking good idea.
It'd have to be pretty good.
Don't be. I'm going. Where we all go. Now how can that be bad.
Daddy calls it an "altercation." How you doing, Sam? You look skinny.
--they hadn't pulled me off that woman I would have jerked a knot in her.
--and that squeaker the Aggies dropped to Oklahoma-sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal--
Last year was awful rough--Mama passing on and the whole business with O.J.--I mean it's not like it was Don Meredith or Roger Staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop--
Do I seem jumpy?
No, I understand.
And you're a big liar! I've got your ring here!
I said it didn't sound like you.
This is hysterical.
Well, I was thinkin', maybe... you know somebody at the bank... could help me get my jewelry out? There's a lot of money in there. Lot of money in there, and I'd be willing to take care of anybody who helped me out.
No more chocolate chip cookies.
Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
Daddy, do you think Missy Dandridge went to heaven?
At school Michael McDowell said she was gonna fry in hell. Michael McDowell says all sewersides fry in hell.
'Please remember that Dr. Furtw ngler risked his life to help anyone who asked him. I personally testify to having seen literally hundreds of people lined up outside his dressing room after concerts to ask for his help. He never turned anyone away. After he heard me play... I am a violinist... he gave me money because I was unable to feed myself or my family and then he helped me to escape to Sweden. He helped countless people in similar ways.'
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?
Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.
Joe... Joe...
Huh?
Who do they think I am?!
God, what a fight that was.
Do you suppose that was our problem? We met before our time? I think that happens a lot. People, events, planets all just circling each other waiting for that moment when everything clicks into place.
God, when we were in that store all I could think about was that one time, when we were in school, and you attacked that little kid who wanted some cereal. Do you remember that?
No.
No. Never.
...No, Ralph. I don't believe I ever was sick. But when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...
Night an' day.
She's loyal and efficient-
No, there's no problem, Dr. Helburn just needs to have his oil changed.
Hmm?
Do you want an argument or an answer?
An answer.
No.
Why not?
Now you want an argument.
I smiled at him.
Uh huh. And I said, 'That's good, because I like the feeling of someone watching me. I acquired the taste from Lenny.'
Should I wait up? We've got to get up early for the beach tomorrow.
Coming to bed?
Let's see if you've gotten any better.
She sounded strong...
I felt a lot safer having it. My milk went bad when I was in jail.
I am. Have a seat.
Sometimes we deliberately step into those traps.
I'll talk to the cops tomorrow and tell you if it's on.
I been thinkin about that, too, and I got me a idea.
I took the early rounds.
Nope. The studio pays. Thank you, Harry.
For not chopping off his head and serving it to me on a platter.
I don't know. It hurts, Harry. Some things, no matter what you do with them, they just hurt.
Do you think we did the right thing?
I... I am Rheya. But I am not the woman you loved ten years ago.
Where'd you get it.
What do you take me for? It's a Navy Cross.
Okay.
You should stay.
I'll pack a picnic -- a night picnic -- night picnics are different -- and --
Yeah? Oh, great!
I don't believe in that soulmate crap anymore, but... he says so many great things. We like the same writers. This writer Stephen Dixon he turned me on to. And he's cute. It's fucked up. Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.
Exactly! I used to do it in college and I had this urge to go do it again, so I got Patrick and we drove all night to get there and he was sweet and said nice things to me, but I was really disappointment to be there with him. Y'know? And that's where psychic stuff comes in. Like, it just isn't right with him. Y'know?
What I know is what I see: a nigger woman hauling shoes.
I'm a Libra too. That's why we get along so well.
We're bring'n im in tomorrow, five AM.
Gimme the weather for tomorrow morning, five A.M. Andrews...
Who's a killer?
Reporters... have to... rise above their hormones.
Thanks. But either way it still feels...
No, don't make trouble. It's nothing.
Titanium Power! Get more snatch by the batch!
I became a bounty hunter because of cunts like you. I remember all the cunts in high school who were mean to me. Eventually... they all grew up to be just like you. Angry and bitter because they peaked early... and now they're stuck in some dead end marriage... or worse yet... an unfulfilling job that keeps them from meeting a man.
Three weeks ago. To borrow money. I wasn t here but he got to my husband, sold him some fancy story about an exhibition of his work and needing money to get new prints made. Carlos handed over 1,000 to get rid of him.
I'm not sure you answered my question.
The 1,000 is on account.
I'm sorry... ... And what about Louise? YOU mentioned that she had gone, were you close to her also?
And is that it?
Oh, I see... Your mentor, perhaps?
Forgive me, Chauncey - I didn't mean to pry. You must have been very close to him.
... Chauncey... Last night you mentioned an old man, that died.
Was he a relative? Or an intimate friend?
At 2.00...
Do you want me to go...?
What?
What? How long was I asleep?
Why did you unleash the pipe, I don't know?
How shall we get out now, Leon?
I don't know... Five minutes.
They're killing him!
You should have heard him talk about you tonight. Like you were the hero in the China Seas.
Could you do somethin' for me?
It is not arguing to speak the truth.
Yes.
I don't know either. You spin around, when you lie down.
Have you ever had a nocturnal emission?
That's the name for when you wake up and find this little pool of sticky stuff, like after a sexy dream.
That's nice. Are you drunk?
You're allergic to hay.
That's not why I'm here... ... though you have no idea what it's like to have a real conversation with a doctor about Spencer...
Are you at leisure Holy Father, now? Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
What if this mixture do not work at all? Shall I be married then tomorrow morning?
Oh, yeah? I wish I had seen it.
Yes.
- shows up for an audition when everyone knew I'd be here... and gives a performance! Out of nowhere - gives a performance!
What is it, a surprise?
Hunh-uh. What's that?
After Drama Group.
A brown suit, brown shoes and a white shirt and a grayish tie with red, or reddish brown figures on it.
Such nonsense, what do you all take me for - little Nell from the country? Been my understudy for over a week without my knowing, carefully hidden no doubt-
Is everything alright?
I've finished for the evening. Will you be needing anything else?
Whenever you lose, you get this attitude. But it's just a game.
I have a better idea, let's run It out of them!
What?
What is it?
I'm not sure. That's the funny thing about him. He's the kind of guy that you never know what he wants or what he might do to get it.
Yeah. I knew him when I was still in school.
Who are you? Who are you REALLY?
Bone? Boom? Something Bee. I hire him while you were in the hospital. He came cheap.
-- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
I need to sit down.
I have faced him. Have you?
I am cheerful with a plan to soothe your miseries. All of England shudders with the news of renewed rebellion.
He will fight you forever. But what does he fight for? Freedom first, and peace. So grant them.
You want my number?
I ain't got the money.
Tell me what happened on April 9th -- 13 years ago.
Shhh, shhh. You're not going to jail, Frances. The Judge has put you under my care. I'll see you get the rest you need.
Mama, what's...
It's alright now, little sister, everything's going to be just fine.
You're taking me home!
What did ya do?
What?! Parole officer? You mean you're a criminal?
J.D.! Just tell me. I know you're not some schoolboy. Now come on, nobody ever tells me shit.
Oh really? Well, I guess you can kiss that career as an art appraiser goodbye, because we paid over four hundred thousand for it at the contemporary picture sale last June.
Everyone is gone. Rhonda is in the bathroom.
No!
- and for you.
You're always after truth - on the stage. What about off?
Don't run away, Bill.
When you told me that whatever I became, it would be because of you-
Then face it. I have. Since that first night - here - in the dressing room.
What changed?
I'm not a man, Sidney, I'm -
Like you?
I have to.
Because I have to.
...or that the guardrail wasn't strong enough.
Is it true that you gave Nicole one of Lydia's dresses? That she was wearing it when the bus crashed?
Of course we're ready. We've taken all the classes. The nursery. The books --
What's that -- mistake number two, Norman?
Getting your nails done is one thing but going to dinner with a bunch of strangers and him... She didn't even look at him.
See you home...
Kill the people. Got your key?
Byron couldn't have said it more graciously... here we go-
Can't keep his eyes off my legs.
Yeah, I'm fucking fantastic.
...what have you done to me...
It is an emergency, isn't it?
You'd better get Dr. Woodly.
I sat there once. It was hot. Like today. I'd been shopping. I had all these bags around my feet I kept having to move every time the waiter came by...
Then get him.
I just feel like I'm getting a little ... out of control that's all. It's kind of frightening.
We have to wait and see. I think that, for everything in life, you have to wait and see.
You were not.
Come over after I'm done here?
Sort of.
You rat.
I'm not in danger. I have a dead bolt. Remember?
Honey, all the great ones came through here at one time or another.
Have many famous actors and actresses lived here? I was meaning to ask you that.
You probably don't remember her, but Louise Bonner lives right over there in number 29. When she isn't drunk she runs a damn good acting class.
I...
No, I don't.
Sweetheart, you don't know the half of it.
I guess I've come to quite a place.
I can hardly wait, Coco.
That's good. They're allowed, but I don't like 'em...for obvious reasons. One man used to live here that had a prize fighting kangaroo. You wouldn't believe what that kangaroo did to this courtyard ... let's see your Aunt's apartment ... it's a good one.
I've got a lulu -- why?
I didn't say that.
Well, you must have realized the chances an encounter like this would happen here. In the ocean. 70 percent of the earth's surface is water, Norman. That's first grade geography.
Just keep your mouth shut, alright? This could mean everything to our careers, you know that? Don't jeopardize this.
Susan, I really think -
What are you going to do? You cannot drive them out onto the road. They can stay with me.
What are you looking at?
There's a million birds here.
Walter.
You don't molest little girls anymore, do you?
I wouldn't accept it. Also, I'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.
Is this testing whether I'm an android or a lesbian?
"Dad."
Do I need it?
No.
Yes, please.
I know, I know, and your hamster.
Tch, well, you know, eventually it, it is going to happen to all of us.
Tell me even if you're scared. Tell me why you wanted me here. It's okay.
That wasn't payment. When you first came into breakfast, when I saw you -- I thought you were handsome... Then, of course, you spoke... So now that your soft li'l underbelly is all exposed. Tell me, why did you bring me?
Sex with Simon?
That's why you brought me? Look at me! Is that really why you brought me... Like I'm a what and I owe you what?!
Nice... Very interesting... Great! ... I guess.
I seen a man die. He couldn't breathe... his heart was... was givin' out.
No.
I was just talking a walk. I tried to call the kids but everybody was out and I couldn't find them. I hate my life. I just hate it.
Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming. He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left. And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me. Then I ran out of the house.
Yes! I don't know! I mean maybe he doesn't mean it but he acts like he does. We're altogether and we're going to celebrate Easter and catch a double bill. Big deal. So I put on my new dress and I came out and he--
He calls me a dirty tramp--my own father!
Okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. Does that clarify the situation?
I guess.
"I want to meet you..."
Copy that, continuing forward. You just want me to get shots of everything, right?
Just ask it!
Hey, I got some great stuff... it's okay.
Did you speak to the Governor?
John!? What the hell's the matter with you?
I'm not through asking my questions.
Why doesn't Claudia talk to you, Jimmy?
I think that you know.
Do you feel better now that you've said this?
I'm not mad. I am, but I'm not. Y'know?
I'm a ballplayer. If anyone knows what that means it should be you.
I never asked you to choose.
Gentlemen of the "Enquirer"! This has, I think, been a fitting welcome to those distinguished journalists - Mr. Reilly in particular - who are the latest additions to our ranks. It will make them happy to learn that the "Enquirer's" circulation this morning passed the two hundred thousand mark.
I know.
You're right, Mr. Bernstein.
Yes.
Is that normal?
She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
How did she hide it during the day?
She likes him.
Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
How did she hide it from the other nuns?
I think he's been sick. He's alright now, but I think he's been very, very sick.
Well, think about going to sleep. Good night, baby.
I like him, Mom.
Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
He's like a great big bear. 'Creasy bear'...
You do?
Will you take me back to my grandparents?
What about us?
Yes.
Yeah, right! That's where you'd go to find girls! Nome. He's gay, by the way.
Not in...
What?
You did that?
Thank you.
How did it go with the pantyhose?
Just like that. Load up the Lincoln... point it West... stop when we hit the fucking ocean.
The suspects! They won't come.
That's pretty good.
You're lying about one thing, Lester.
It's gone now.
Lower. Same page.
Better. I was really angry.
You can't even give me that?! What were you gonna do, Jack?... Just gonna organize your life... ... walk out that door, move in by yourself and what -- drop the news when you find somebody else? What were you planning to do, Jack?
No. So what time do you need? I love you -- you love me -- you want to get your career going, great! I'd like to be a part of it -- I think I deserve that! So what do you need to figure out alone!?
Good, 'cause I liked what I saw.
He says he's too hot. He doesn't even know I came here today. It's like he's crazy. Jimmy.
Yeah. Does that mean I'm cured?!
I said... you must come out to the house for dinner on Thursday.
Let us settle this tomorrow.
Yes. Jeremy will be home for the weekend. And you can meet the kids.
Come on.
I have to ask you some things... Are you taking any prescription drugs?
Nervous?
What about narcotics?
Any psychiatric medication?
I know your partner's here, but it's very important that you're honest.
What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you. Is that it?
Okay. I think... I think sex is overrated. I think people place way too much importance on it. And I think that stuff about women wanting it just as bad is crap. I m not saying women don't want it, I just don't think they want it for the reason men think they do. I'm getting confused.
Then I got the hell out of that room and called the doctor and I think I woke him probably, he wasn't any too alert. He just said, 'Yeah, he's been expectin' it and said he'd send somebody over...' Lord, what a mornin'!
... Back up those stairs - damn... That Man's needin' me more and more just before he never needs me again...
He's dead, Chance! The Old Man's dead!
Must of happened durin' the night, I don't know... Lord, he wasn't breathin' and as cold as a fish. I touched him, just to see, and you believe me, Chance - that's doin' more than I get paid to do... Then I just covered him up, pulled the sheet over his head...
I am no one's wife. I live in my own house. I do not live in a man's house. He has a wife. We are together. I am free. Because of banking and finance and travel... And I can do anything I want...
Later! Do you dance?
I insist.
Okay. Then, tomorrow, I take the kids with me to the picket line.
Pull over. I've got to get back there.
If he didn't want to go through the roadblock, is there any other way to get to Vegas?
Yes, I want to kill you! I hate your fuckin' guts!
Yes! Hi.
From back in Houston. We both come up on Fifth Street.
Leave him alone!
He's doing his best.
Why worry about me? You're the one who says only look out for yourself.
I can't get away just yet. I'm at Aaron's.
Hi. It's me.
It wasn't as bad as he think, was it? -- it wasn't unprecedented or anything?
I'm not sure. It seems like he had sort of a mishap on the news.
People beat it, don't they? All the time.
Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
Well... OK... here it is... Uh... I'd like you to take a look at my horse. Now -- it won't take long and if, after that, you still don't feel...
It's, uh... beautiful country. I had a little bit of a hard time finding the place. There are no signs.
Oh no. She's here. I brought him along. And my daughter, too. We're staying at Peterson's...
Paul, don't let them die.
I won't, Earl.
That's awful kind of you, Sheriff. I've got to get started on my interview. See you later.
No, thanks Sheriff. I'm leaving town tonight.
May I use the phone please.
I care a great deal about him, yes.
How's work?
You'll never find the answer for everything God did.
I thought you didn't believe in miracles today Mother?
Well give me a reasonable explanation
A miracle is an event without an explanation. If she's capable of putting a hole in her hand without benefit of a nail, why couldn't she split a cell in her womb?
How ?
Don't be ridiculous.
You're saying God did it?
But how did it happen?
This is insane.
There as no man in the convent on that night and no way for any man to get in or out.
Here we go.
I know you. You're gonna run back to work right after dinner. I want my kiss now.
Milo?
Oh, right. Hold on.
Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it?
I remember the song. I just couldn't remember who sang it.
You really believe that?
I had a big brother who died over there, too. He wasn't no flyer though. He was just your basic Marine Corps type. I was only twelve when it happened, so I don't remember much about him.
Yeah, I sucked his cock.
I tell you this world just keeps getting more and more violent.
Caesar ...
Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
A perfect night.
Oh my God, the sitter.
Hm. We should do it again.
Booth. Don't. It's nothing. It's not worth it. Remember what happened the last time?
Let's not get into this again. I know him. If you said something, he'd take it out on me.
Who can forget this great hit from the 50's?
I feel as though I've stepped into a time warp!
"Authentic 50's diner"? Since when were there mini-malls in the 1950's?
God, it's so totally pathetic.
Okay, okay!
Hey, look at this...
Or maybe not.
Maybe they're slowly poisoning us or they're planning to brainwash us and --
That lets us off the hook.
Maybe there's some weird secret satanic society that meets at the Quality Cafe and all of the other regular customers are in on it except for us.
Who?
hey.
How long with Ellen?
Why are you talking like that?
Arnie, I feel like Alice stepping through the looking glass.
What is he being charged with?
Oh, no.
What good is it going to do us to go to some ranch?
We have to get to Sonora. There are jobs waiting for us there. We'll pay you for your trouble.
Our kind of women?
Uh...yeah.
I don't know what I take you for anything...
We decided the night before last, before we came up here...
The setting wasn't romantic, but Lloyd was. He woke me up at three in the morning, banging on my door - he couldn't sleep, he told me - he's left Karen, he couldn't go on with the play or anything else until I promised to marry him... we sat and talked until it was light. He never went home...
We sat and talked, Addison. I want a run of the play contract.
Well, say something - anything! Congratulations, skol - good work, Eve!
Please.
You can ask any price you want, but you must give me those letters.
The stairs from the street.
Richard, I had to see you.
Oh. Geez.
I know how you feel about me, but I'm asking you to put your feelings aside for something more important.
Okey-dokey, thanks a bunch. I'll let you get back to your paperwork, then.
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away. Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take.
Sure... What's Grace up to?
What?
I should be in by two.
No, but then I don't talk to John that much anymore.
No.
We used to, every summer.
Linda Cooksey?
Roosevelt finished last in his class -- Beethoven was deaf, an' Helen Keller was blind -- I think Rocky has a good chance.
I'll be waiting.
Congratulations, Enzo.
Would you knock it off, Sam?
There's nothin' to figure out. I'm home... we're workin' it out.
Yeah, I guess you're right.
Yeah, but I like the sun. I grew up on a reservation. The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us. Jake's the same way. He loves the desert. I guess we're alike that way. That's about the only way.
It'll warm you up.
Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me.
I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love?
That's the XKE.
Care, but just don't let it get to you. It gives them power.
It is?
As long as he keeps out of the park.
This -- him -- Landon -- is what's best for me!
No, no.
The dessert fork!
...fish fork, salad fork, meat fork and. . .
You must have.
Fine.
What is he doing there?
You hated being alone. Couldn't stand it. Busy every minute. Always plugged into something.
This is so unfair.
You okay?
What will you do?
I've got to get back to Memphis. Hannah's babysitter has finals.
I've you to look after me, haven't I?
I haven't been to see the Marquis for ages. And I won't -- ever again -- I swear it. I won't speak to him, I won't even utter his name --
You've really got to go.
I'm relaxed--light your cigarette.
All those articles you people write-- where do you find that stuff?
I never worked for Sloan or Stans.
No, Jabez -- all I need is some rest -- You go and pay our debt. Everything'll be all right then ... everything.
Yes, Jabez -- don't worry.
Jabez ...
He does.
Yes.
Sometimes. Afterward.
When we're making love?
So, you wonder why?
It's not hopeless...
We just need to figure out a place where you can meet somebody who isn't a total idiot, that's all.
Okay. In a few minutes.
I'd rather end up like you than those people at that stupid bar... At least you're an interesting person... at least you're not exactly like everybody else...
Goodbye, Mr. Gillis.
Yes. Tell me.
Who is he?
It will be perfectly all right, Walter. Mother is coming with us on the train.
Peter, where are you?
Why's it here?
OH MY GOD. Look at that.
It was great to meet you again. To see you again, thanks for helping me yesterday --
What's all this pudding?
I can't find that thing in my car, I can't find it so I'll just get it and give it to you later. So?
You ready?
Are you coming to eat with us?
Yah - how are you doon?
Heck, it's been such a long time, Mike. It's great to hear from ya.
I'd better come with you, then. Are you sure you can drive?
They're questioning Vaughan about an accident near the airport. Some pedestrian... they think he was run over intentionally.
You'd better drive him. He's a bit shaky. I'll follow in my car. Where is yours?
Good night, Steve.
There's a nice boy.
That why you always took him on the other side of the street?
Like what?
I don't see how you can even think of it now.
I couldn't resist them.
No, no. I'm not ready for you. There's some vodka in the freezer.
This is the group I was telling you about.
Oh, no!
Well what was I supposed to do?! He wants me to live underground with him! That's like Silence of the Lambs, don't you think?!
...I do.
Zoe, come say hello to your father...
Chasing what?
You were very different yesterday.
What is it -- what are you talking about?
Read it. It'll be fine.
Einstein flunked out of school... twice.
But you said we could be together.
Now what?
I said you were a loser!
Come in out of the rain. In the morning we'll have both our stories for breakfast.
I'd better get in there.
His father walked out on his mother a couple of months after he was born. Louisa was Henry's younger sister, and she and the baby moved in with us. Four or five years go by, and then one day Cyrus shows up out of the blue, tail between his legs, wanting to patch things up with Louisa. I thought Henry was going to tear Cyrus apart when he saw him walk through the door. They're both big men, those two, and if they ever started to tangle, you'd see some teeth jumping on the floor. I guarantee it ... So Cyrus persuaded Louisa to go out with him to talk things over in quiet. And the poor girl never came back.
She was a liar, she was a liar!
I had to get in, to meet Margo! I had to say something, be somebody, make her like me!
Now what?
Bud, that water's only a couple degrees above freezing.
They're waiting for him to walk in.
Terry...?
Hon, maybe your mom would like t...
Jesus had nothing to do with it. If He'd been involved. He would have seen to it that things worked out the opposite from what they did.
Well, that's what I was saying. My father is getting old. And we're very close. He's a wonderful man, really...
Don't put words in my mouth. What I'm saying is she drove off in Cyrus's car and went to the Five-Spot Lounge with him for a drink. What I'm saying is that he imbibed too much in the way of alcohol and that when they finished their little talk three hours later and got back in the car, he was in no shape to drive. But he drove the car anyway, and before he could get her back to where she lived, the damn fool ran a red light and went straight into a truck. Louisa got thrown through the windshield and was killed. Cyrus lived, but he came out of it a cripple. His left arm was so mangled, the doctors had to cut it off. Small punishment for what he did, if you ask me.
We've got to put that, into the Inaugural. "I have here, a ribbon. You haven't seen it before, and you will not see it too often now. For it is the Proud Possession of a few, a very few Men and Women... it is the Ribbon of the Albanian Campaign...."
It is, isn't it? It is your first time.
You can admit that, can't you?
It's nothing to be ashamed of --
On your first time --
Says who?!
You can't print that!
One can tell you are from back home. These people nowadays don't know what manners are.
I'd better go in.
How?
You're the one always turning your nose up at me.
Mr. Van Orton... ?
It's fine.
Don't curse.
Not yet. That old lady makes him sweat. Where's that card?
Did he tell her?
She's dying. But I could still hear her big mouth.
There you go.
It's not that --
Terribly sorry I'm late, lunch was long and I couldn't find a cab - where's Miss Caswell, shall we start? Oh, hello, Eve...
Are they dangerous when they're awake?
No. I can't. Not yet.
What? Where?
Wow! They're so quiet.
Hi ya, big boy? How's it goin'? Like it in here?
All that animal fat. I feel it in my pores or something.
I'm gonna hurl, David. I swear to God.
Yeah, you mean not at my age.
Yeah!
Really?
You know, let me tell you something! I'm not that kind of person. I don't do people favors. If I talk to you it's because I want to. So we're not all ...uh...Jerri Hall...Big deal... What a boring world if we were. You do the best you can with what you got. You're not so so invisible, ya know... You want make an impression? Try this; you can be a real bitch.
I'm paying you.
Why not?
No, I didn't.
What do you mean he doesn't want me to come over? Did you tell him about me?
I don't... he doesn't want you to come over.
What the hell happened over there? Did he make a pass at you?
Because. Cynthia, look, John was right. Graham is strange. Very strange. You don't want to get involved with him.
Well, why?
Because I never got around to it.
Then what's the story, what's this "strange" bullshit all of a sudden? Is he drowning puppies, or what?
No!
Right now. Tell me someplace you've been -- someplace on the other side of the world. Anywhere but here.
Yes, I did, John. But I I had no idea what was going on.
I used my own money and got a great deal, it's a Q47NR five day fare, which means that I have to change planes in Dallas and stay over a Saturday.
I already bought a ticket.
Oh come on Harry, we're talking about five days here.
Oh yeah, Sunday night. You guys been out tasting today?
I'm doing good, good. You look great. Did you lose some weight?
Hi. Well, nice to see you guys here. Bye, Miles.
Well, not yet. The gate was open?
Oh, you see an analyst?
Hey, well, listen... hey, you wanna come upstairs and, uh... and have a glass of wine and something? Aw, no, I mean... I mean, you don't have to, you're probably late and everything else ...
You sure?
Fifteen years?
But you knew this was important to me.
AND A SONG SOMEONE SINGS ONCE UPON A DECEMBER.
Lemme see.
That was a nice girl last night, Marty. She wasn't a very good-looking girl, but she looks like a nice girl. I said, she wasn't a very good-looking girl... not very pretty...
I said, is she Italian girl?
She looks thirty-five, forty. She didn't look Italian to me.
Just want to be a little sharper. For a few minutes.
Is it possible...?
Yes, sir.
Yes, sir.
By our standards... yes.
I don't have the figures in front of me, but yes, that sounds about right.
Hey, you going to watch or you going to do?
What brings you inside?
Some things never change, do they?
Not in this thing.
Yeah. So sue me.
You noticed.
If it isn't a baby... what is it?
He didn't say very much. Wanted to know how I was and how the children were.
I didn't expect --
Caesar, this is Corky. Corky, Caesar.
No. Rajeev's in India.
She's doing the work herself.
No really... I guarantee I could get you a date in like two seconds...
Oh, come on! What are you talking about?
No you're not! You're a cool guy, Seymour.
And above all, just because this happened gives you no right whatsoever...
What? I'm sorry, talk.
Find the bird cage?
I want him to at least see the sky!
No, Calvin. We're not going to make do. Not me! Not Adam. We're going up no matter what! We deserve it. Even if it's terrible!
And the ocean! A mountain range!
Oh, no! Oh, my goodness! Let's get him into the bedroom.
He seems to be doing all right now. I don't know if he's had a heart attack or just... a horrifying experience. But we need supplies and I've got to stay with him.
Aren't you Nick Charles?
Everybody knows --
Ohh!
Just a minute...
Go you Huskies!
I know, no-- I know.
So early?
I mean, y-you know, don't say it that way, you know, because my confidence is not my strong point, I--
The Halfords have invited us again this year.
I don't really need to practice. I just play a few notes, you know, so I thought maybe I'd stay in.
Well, I'm sure your father and I would love to hear what you're playing these days. Maybe after dinner.
No, no! You don't understand, I love you! It's real love and I can't help it! Please kiss me, Mr. Hillyer, I love you, I love you so much...
Uh-huh.
Easily.
Gray. They were a lovely, lovely gray.
And my eyes...my eyes are gray. Look! You see!
Anybody could know that song.
Look at me. Look at me, mother darling. Look into my eyes. What color eyes did Barbara have?
Oh, doesn't that prove something to you? Doesn't it?
I didn't need you to take the blame for me, I'm quite...
His mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. He could do a lot better if you ask me.
He's pitiful, Doc, a goddam puppy. I don't know how much longer I can put up with it. I already got two arms and legs, I don't need another appendage.
I don't recall inviting you.
I need practice.
You're not terribly good at taking care of h...
It's, uh, it's under twenty-five.
Well, I can assure you, it won't happen again. Thanks for your concern. Goodbye.
I never stop thinking about it, Detective. The only way in or out of this school is through that gate, and it is secured at all times.
I hope you won't talk that way to the police when they come here.
Gilbert!
Nonsense! She got at she deserved.
Don't. It's horrible.
Well, I don't really listen to her when it comes to men. I mean, look at John, for crissake. Oh, you went to school with him didn't you? You're probably friends or something.
Give it back Nicholas!
He was very polite, worth the entire five dollars.
I, uh, know a guy at the power company.
I hope everything goes all right.
Nope.
Stamped?
Hollis' death. I tried to keep it from her, I didn't want her upset before I could make plans for her to leave.
I want to report a wrongful arrest.
She's too upset.
The police?
She's not tied up!
Joe, I can't look at you any more.
Come on, Joe.
If you love me, Joe.
Don't make me sick. I'd sooner drown myself in Puget Sound.
As usual. Everything as usual, Mr. Farmer. Just give me my due.
Dad, please, don't leave early. Just because of Mama --
It's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what I mean. I-I... I can't put it into words. The important thing is-is-is it-it breathes.
You think so?
If there's gold. If!
Okay. These are good.
There's another gig starting in Saudi Arabia. I'm just a walk-on this time though. Bit-part.
May I have a drink?
How are you?
Uh-- APRIL I-i-it has an o-organic quality, you know.
On the cervix transfer, you almost lost the T297.
Hello, Benjamin.
Right.
To calm my anxiety.
Clear?
A game?
Nope.
Come with me...
You don't know who she was, Annie --
I saw her. She looked just like this --
Yeah, well, I'm, but I...
I mean, I can go uptown, too. I live uptown, but... uh, what the hell, I mean, it'd be nice having company, you know I mean, I hate driving alone.
Me? Oh, downtown!
It's okay.
It' s alright Jack ... it' s alright.
You can't make me stop caring...
I said, you can't make me stop caring about people.
I was just tryin' to help him. It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy!
OOh, yeah...Don't know if it's the floor or the skating.
Do you know what Ethan will do if he has a chance?...He'll put a bullet in her brain! And I tell you Martha would want him to!
I don't know where. In your store, somewhere in your town... anywhere.
Don't you know?
I want to know if my sister is here.
With you.
Of course.
Why not?
God! It looks like the Army!
Isn't it beautiful?!!
It's grand!
What in the hell is it?!
It's the Goddamn Grand Canyon!
Way up ahead!
What in the hell is that up there?
Where?!
I'm sorry, Mom. I'll call Grandma back and apologize.
I don't know, I don't know, I just know it.
Oh yes. When he came up on business.
Adam....you should go with Dr. Aron. It's the best thing. The best thing for you. I promise.
Yes. I met him last year.
I like calling you David.
I've done the slut thing, David. It's really kinda old.
You're gonna forget about me.
Well, Ill tell you this. I have learned a lesson tonight. I wasn't gonna run around, but when I start botherin' your Daddy and worse robbin' a cradle, I gotta face the facts of life. Tomorrow mornin', I'm gonna get myself up and go out.
Brother, when I have to wake you up at eleven o'clock in the morning you're either sick or you were up very late last night. And you weren't reading Huckleberry Finn. I looked and its not in your room. Now what were you doing?
Buddy, Mr. Right is out there somewhere and I'm gonna find him!
Oh, Buddy, you do love me! I knew you did, knew it all the time...
Oh, Brother, I am so disappointed in you. You mustn't look at those horrible things, they degrade the human image.
What's the matter with her?
Isn't that what all this is about? Letting Jamie go out, cooking me dinner, -- your next assignment?
... That's great.
-- what?
What's wrong?
Who is to say our morals are better than hers? But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly...
15, sir.
What?
Dysfunctional --
...And how much is it?
Huh? Why?
Can I sit on the stairways now?
Oh.
Oh, speaking of records...I bought that Mozart Trio you recommended...
That'swhatI'msayin'. I'm not blowin' my young career, brother or no brother, for you or anybody else.
I don't want it to taste different. I don't know why I bother. Is that enough for you? Hey!
Yeah.
He's not the man who's cast a shadow here.
-- think what you have time to think, Lester.
Oh, and Holly met a wonderful man who loves opera. An architect.
Let's do that.
I don't believe this is happening...
Isn't that beautiful?
Isn't it obvious? I'm trying to seduce you.
Because I want to. I've wanted to since I first saw you in the elevator.
Why?
You dropped that earring down the drain on purpose, didn't you?
You're here... I'm a bit surprised.
He shot the Chancellor's dog, didn't he? The blind one.
At first the police thought he just ran away, but this afternoon Dr. Gaskell found some blood spots on the carpet --
Crabtree said it sounded like something James would be messed up in.
Who does?
They want your autograph.
I don't remember saying yes.
'Nam oyo ranged kyo.' You think it's dumb of course.
I'd invite you up but I know you'd hate the incense. I chant.
This little guy thinks you're Robert Redford... the other one thinks you're Charles Bronson...
It's for motion sickness.
That boy you brought in, he was shot, wasn't he?
You ratted on my mother??
snatches up an exercise book from a large pile.
These stories are not going to get you School Certificate! You don't seriously think anyone's going to publish them?
It's because of the Marquis, isn't it?
You're rude . . . rude and insolent! I don't see why I should keep a horrid child like you at school a minute longer.
I don't wanna be in bloody school!
All right! You go out there and get a job and you damn well pay your own way!
What are you talking about?
Anywhere?
Hawaii. I've read all about it. I've dreamed of going there and just lying on the beach while the water licked up against my feet. Oh, God. I'd kill to go there.
No. Too... upright. Might've been a person.
Come on.
I think we should follow him...
Well, what're you going to do?
A year? How'd you manage that?
Go ahead. I'll expose you.
Telling me off. Is it going as well as you hoped... ? "... Mr. Taylor."
No, it's not that, it's...
It's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.
Sure you could, in Wildwood, New Jersey. If you sold this, you could have a pretty nice penthouse on Fifth. But you wouldn't have much left over for decoration.
Wait a sec. I want Tita to take a picture of you an' me in front of the place...
There goes another scrub lady.
Yeah!
Not really. I'd say that Gordon is one of the most astute collectors around. He has a great eye and he only buys the best. Like this rug for instance, a silk Tabriz, the finest of its kind. The day after he bought it in London, a dealer representing the Saudi Royal Family offered him twice what he paid. It absolutely makes the room. See how this little bit of celadon in the border is picked up in the cushions oh the sofa... although... I don't know if I would have used that tea dipped linen for the upholstery - too dingy. And it's a sacrilege having that Pre-Columbian pot in the center of the coffee table. Some dope might use it as an ashtray.
Why are you so cold to her and Carlo? They live with us on the Mall now, but you never get close to them.
Will you?
Yes?
I'm sure you're going to love it there.
Are you okay?
Now I remember. Annette Harrison. Your father's the new headmaster at Oakwood.
That's right.
Have we met?
I don't think so.
I'm Kathryn.
Annette Harrison.
Write me well.
Sleeping pills.
Doctor.
Don't you want to make one?
What difference does it make why I do it?
What would you know about a normal frame of mind?
What do you have to do to get ready?
Then do it.
What are you doing here?
If only I could. But one of us must stay. Father's not strong. Willie's just a child. Who can look after them in your absence? Who can run the estate?
I will be here when you return.
Not as weak as I.
Our decision. Together.
They know I'm delivering for you. I mention the half-million -- they don't give a fuck about that -- They want you with guns. So I say, well, if you want proof he's getting paid for selling them, let me bring the money in.
Is it dead?
Well, so far he is. But you have to admit he's not too bright.
I have that date -- remember?
You know I do.
Where are we going, Jeff? Not back to that leaky boat --
See if they make sense. To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind.
This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles. Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes. To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay.
Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school. The first time they meet ...
I'll make it short.
I'm not good enough to write it alone. We'll have to do it together.
-- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him.
Oh yeah! Better be good and hurry away then! Who knows? We might be being watched! Maybe one of your stupid French companies has got a detective prying into your life - after all, that s what they do to their employees, isn t it? Huh! Hope you enjoy ruining people s lives. Thanks for the lift!
Is it intelligent?
Is it a planet?
Yes. But not until you mentioned them. As soon as you said those things, I remembered them. And they have associations that make me think of other things I remember. It's like filling up.
What do you mean?
Where are we, mean man?
Really? Oh, so she's really going to do all this nudity?
Mmm.
Viktor, we simply have to talk about "Eternity..."
Whatever. I still haven't received Simone's script notes.
I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me!
Doesn't she look pretty?
I don't even know you.
Come on.
She's in bed. She was throwing up. Ever since Mrs. Rogers called and said Missy--
You're lying.
Good morning, Mister... It's Danielle!
Get it.
You're not going to Gray.
You must leave this house.
Hello, Bob, it's me.
So we passed some kind of test?
Open it.
Okay... but I want you to know one thing. I've got to look great tonight, I mean I have to look great, okay?
Really? Look in your ex-wife's eyes.
Oh right...So it's just complicated for you and Jackie -- for me it's pretty simple cause I just don't understand...
You know I don't need another person in this family making me feel like an idiot...your ex-wife's doing a bang up job and I have to face it every Tuesday and Thursday and every other goddamn weekend and I just don't know how the hell you were married to her for so goddamn long! Jesus what did you see in her? I don't get it -- I just don't get it.
You know what I mean. I know you've at least thought about it.
Is everything getting worse?
The Countess has come to our aid. The Rubber Rose Ranch is officially deeded to all the cowgirls. And I have been asked to oversee the ranch. For 300 a week. And as it turns out, the Countess is not going to be the vegetable the doctors thought he was... here's a picture!
She had a one way-ticket to Kansas City.
But that's an old story now...... I can't believe that you would leave the Butte.
At six o'clock on the wake-up news they used the wrong missile graphic.
A half hour in the lobby.
You lived in Chicago?
It's a man's world, Mr. Booker. Most women have to.
You stand still too long in New York you get hit by a bicycle messenger. You know, sometimes, I get the feeling, Mr. Booker, that you're laughing at me. Why is that?
That's your cue to say you're not laughing at me.
Hardly. I couldn't be less alone.
I was looking at you, your clothes, I wouldn't have known you...
And co. A lot of co. Oh, God, I've thought about you so much.
What did you really see? This whole time... special effects, squibs, like in the movies. Please, you've got to believe me... He's got a gun, with real bullets!
Listen very carefully, I'm telling the truth... this is the game. This was all the game.
No, now wait... think about it. What did you see... ?
He's got a gun. Everyone, he's got a real gun up here! Real situation! ... damn it...
Nicholas, this is fake. It's all part of the game...
Fred. The way he looked when you screamed at him.
So Ed. What did you do before you became a bounty hunter?
Really? Did you play in a band?
Switch? What fucking switch?
Hi.
So, I'm a piece of equipment. Use me.
You use your equipment, don't you?
Two of us might be more effective than one.
There's two reasons a man rejects help. Either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.
I think you need more help than you've got.
Thanks, Melvin.
Let me go in back. You look like you need all the room you can manage.
But will he... ?
I'd love to. But aren't you supposed to meet up with Simone?
Ms. Kramer.
A perk for what?
Does he have to go?
I'll tell him. What is it? Is it a mine?
Any news?
No, I don't, I don't.
You're too good to me.
Hello....congratulations.
Hello. My name is Lydia Sinclair.
Oh...like Moses.
So how do we do this?
Why does Rachel scream?
I thought you were flirting with me a little.
Do you wanna go tonight? I mean, are you working?
What's she like?
Oh sure yes, that's fine, late dinners are good. Should I get dressed up or -- ?
Yes.
You don't want to be a war correspondent - how about being a dramatic critic?
I mean I've got a job for you.
Yes?
You start tomorrow night. Richard Carl in "The Spring Chicken." I'll get us some girls. You get tickets. A drama critic gets them free, you know. Rector's at seven?
You're wrong. It does make a difference to you - Rector's, Brad? Come to think of it, I don't blame you for not wanting to be a war correspondent. You won't miss anything. It isn't much of a war. Besides, they tell me there isn't a decent restaurant on the whole island.
Three minutes. It couldn't have been over three minutes, the Secret Service...
Six months. I found some marijuana, that's all. And a little pipe about two inches long. I talked with her. She said her friends smoked pot and drank --
Did you just make that up?
You guys should stop by the restaurant for lunch today.
David, I promise we will. Keep him happy.
You demand a lot from your readers, you do.
What about Grace?
You like it?
Well, it's almost over. We've gone to school together for three years... I might cut that part out.
Having taken a few courses at the university this year, I have glimpsed our future, and all I can say is... go back.
Alright, no more, I'm going to save it.
I don't believe it. You're a romantic, Frank.
I promise we're gonna get away from him. The time has to be right, that's all. I'd rather him get tired of me and leave me. Then he wouldn't want to hurt me. He wouldn't care then. We'll be fine. I promise. You go to bed now. I love you.
Huh?
I guess. He went to the garage. Poor thing, he's probably never seen such a crazy mess. He probably wants to go back and live in Mr. Cox's shop.
Mr. August, I'm not at all sure -
Thank you.. .goodnight.
But I reel guilty. It doesn't seem right for me to enjoy myself with Jacqueline gone.
I know he does.
Where?
Gloria -- sell the House.
This has been a real confusing day.
Okay, good. I think I should be the one to tell 'em, cause they trust me more than --
Oh no... It doesn't please me at all...
Fuck legal terms. We're talking about human beings here. Sick people. A whole bunch of them are gonna be dead in ten years. They need their money now! We gotta get 'em to agree to the arbitration, Ed. We gotta get every damn one of those plaintiffs to --
I LOVE YOU.
How is your father?
I love you.
He must have tucked a lot of women in that huge car of his. It's like a bed on wheels. It must smell of semen...
Isn't there something called group hysteria?
Yes, but...
Then where is she?
What's happening to me?
Oh, Paul--
I know.
I told you this was a simple-minded play.
And this is my son, Paul. He was only four years old when his father disappeared.
I'll go out with you, or I'll stay here, and do anything you'd like for me to do... if you'll just do one thing. If you'll tell me that you love me.
You know what, you are never satisfied.
Don't worry about it. He owes me some favors.
California.
I know that, sir. Ma'am. It's just that... Beggin' your pardon, Senator, but... do you understand that this involves combat training?
Stand still, Miss Jenny!
She was twenty-one when she came to me. ... Straight from leaving you.
...I don't know.
Hello, Mr Crane.
"Coronado."
She has never mentioned her family.
Some village in the mountains -- Alethera, I think.
I'm cooking pasta primavera.
I need sleep. Some of us are mere mortals.
No.
Of course it's the reason. It's terrible what you did.
Working up tears for a new piece cutaway...You totally crossed the line between...
It made me ill. You could get fired for things like that.
It just proves that the difference we have are...
You go first.
In Cluett's office?
Nothing. Tom, I thought you were going out with me tonight.
I drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound. And I wound up staying for a couple of hours.
I don't want to go home.
What're you guys doing? Huh?
What, you gonna give it all up for a maple twist? How dumb you gotta be? That's exactly what they --
See anything interesting?
Nor you. To you that word is as unfamiliar as love.
Sounds good, where are you now?
Why not?
Why?
Why not?
I'm not interested in the latest dating tips from Jonathan Taylor Thomas.
How is she?
But I do appreciate it, Mr Crane...
How's Peterson's holding up for you?
You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... do their... work.
The war's over - you told me yourself. How can it be desertion?
When he dies I'll catch up.
I don't know... every once in a while I just get the feeling something awful's going to happen.
Let me come, too. Please don't leave me alone.
Here in the canyon.
Gunshots, there were some gunshots.
What are you gonna do?
I don't know... just... somebody's going to get me.
Yeah?
I'm sorry.
Ludwig? He's gay - are you jealous?
Goodbye, Muffin.
No, you're the muffin.
... Maybe, if Jacques will let me fix up the place a little.
Scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. You came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. But I didn't even know what happened... 'til I heard it on the news the next morning.
John? John where are you going?
I hate him for what he did to me.
Yes.
I hate him...
Of course you do. Who was it?
Not your fault...
Agnes who did you see?
No...
He frightened you and he hurt you. It's not your fault. It's his fault. Tell us who he is so we can find him. Stop him from doing this to other women.
For what he made me go through.
Who?
I thought you had a girlfriend.
And you tore up your knee. Rehab is tough.
What?
Thanks for the lift. If the bike's any bother--
Tell me later.
What difference does it make?
No, Jack, I never got married. You?
Yes!
I found it!
You know - we do have enough money. Especially now.
I'm trying to help, Duff.
I could work even after the baby comes. A few hours a week, anyway.
You don't love me, is that it?
Is there somebody else?
How about ... you're too narcissistic to commit to another human being in a long- term way.
I've filed a report with Father Frank.
We need all the help we can get.
We'll see Father Frank in the morning. There's nothing to be done until then.
I smiled and walked away. She also told me Ordell killed Beaumont.
She didn't say.
Uh-huh.
Right. Everything's the same, except one change...
Something came up. I don't want to talk about it.
Always. Ow.
I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl.
All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
Shut up and tell me.
It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the "Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you, Brad, I envy you. By Bradford Leland, the "Enquirer's" Special Correspondent at the Front. I'm almost tempted -
Tell me. I could use someone up my alley.
Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose.
How would the "Enquirer" look with no news about this non-existent war - with Benton, Pulitzer and Heart devoting twenty columns a day to it?
Here you go. One champagne cocktail.
I thought only hookers drank those things.
I'm trying to be delicate with you, but you're not understanding me. It's not just because of Carl, or my music, but because of you... I mean, what would it come to? If a person has no love for himself, no respect, no love for his work, his family, his friends, something... How can he ask for love in return? I mean, why should he ask for it?
Out-of-town. That's all he'll say.
No.
I got things to do.
What are you talking about, you fool? Her fianc 's in Palermo.
Did you like school, Creasy?
We're taking a different way home.
Take that back! Fucking take that back. I'm not a cop any more.
I don't think you're normal.
This fucking job's getting to you. You haven't written a fucking word since you started.
Yes. It was, actually.
Who says I'm the one that called it off?
Laura.
What if it wasn't you that I came back to see?
What gives?
Go where?
She's home -- stuffing a turkey.
Who was that?
That's fine. But what are we going to do about grandma and Uncle Herman and Aunt Sophie and my two nieces --
The poem! I knew he liked the poem! Billy Prince is asking me to the prom.
What?
Yes, mine. I'm going to have one.
Typical male.
His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
We're taking a flight?
It's kind of weird sitting here with you in Stephanie's house. All those times you came into the restaurant. It's like you're a real person now. Almost.
So what's your novel about?
Yeah, weird. But great.
Do you ever feel as though there's always someone watching you?
Donnie?
The same way I'll know that you went to Scotch. Trust.
I've never met him?
It's for the pick-nick. And you won't get a smidgen of my fudge unless you stay for the pick-nick!
You can t really raise a kid in an apartment in the Village...
If it's real enough, he'll believe it, because deep down he'll want to.
I'm trying hard to follow you.
Jack, stop that. I'm still mad at you... ...who knows what would ve happened if you hadn t stepped in at the store.
Not quite. Just visiting. I live in Lincoln Park now.
We were young... Remember that little place on Charles Street we used to go to?
You made coffee?... You're going back to work and you made coffee?... I love this!
Whoah! Oh, honey, that's terrific!
You're kidding! What did he say?
So what's going on? Who's Lou again?
I'm beginning to catch up.
What, you think I just dried up and blew away when you left? The world does turn once in awhile Brian, even without your permission.
For God's sake, forget the money! I'm going crazy! I'm a walking anachronism. I'm a puddle of deja I'm worried about my kids, Scott must be scared to death, I think my daughter's doing drugs again. I can't have any fun here, I don't have that innocence any more. I can't keep all this in anymore. I feel Like I'm going to explode.
Well the answer is that I don't know either. We haven't done it yet.
Oh, Will!
But mama..
MAMA!
He doesn't like it.
Bring it in.
He's melting it as fast as we dump it in.
Pour it in.
I am, too.
Forget about all that. You want to do the right thing? Then defend your name. If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. I know the law, and the law's on your side.
But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?
I believe you.
THX!
Just leave'em. There's plenty of other girls.
God, I don't know who's weirder, you or me.
Yeah.
You a narc?
What's so important?
Your will! Your will! What else could it be?
The art of transformation!
Me!
What? Why?
I know you didn't but you have been so thoughtful.
That's all? That's enough! She was a beautiful little girl.
Stupid woman... and that's all?
It wasn't sex. It was a lot of things, but it wasn't sex. You know when I was in the first grade my best friend was run over on the way to school, you know what the nun said? She died because she hadn't said her morning prayers.
What have we done to hurt you? And don't deny it, I can smell an ex-Catholic a mile away. What did we do? Burn a few heretics, sell some indulgences? That was in the days when the Church was a ruling body. We let governments do those things today. So what did we do to you eh? You wanted to neck in the back seat of a car when you were fifteen and you couldn't because it was a sin?
Nothing...
What the hell has the Catholic Church got to do with you?
You just said...
Who said anything about the Catholic Church...
I wasn't. I wasn't. She was the pretty one. She died, why not me? I never said my morning prayers. And I was ugly, I was scrawny, I had buck teeth and freckles all over my face, do you know what the nun called me, Sister Mary Clitus, called me Polkadot Livingston.
And what has that to do with it?
I'm trying to.
A little Comanche squaw - SQUAW!
Rose, you don't have to.
You... You are out of order, Mr Lombard. I...
Sorry?
I... If you don t mind, I do not think he matters now. It... Things turned out to be as we thought; Leon was weak. There s no point in delving into his sad life anymore. Now, will you please tell me how much we owe you?
I... Well, we re burying Leon tomorrow and... Look, I wish I had more time, but it s late and with the funeral...
Nothing.
Mark? Why is Juno crying?
Juno? What's going on?
Not really. I'm sixteen. I'm old enough to tell when people are acting like total a-holes!
Please don't get a divorce! God, Mark, just do me a solid and stay with your wife.
Yeah, but didn't you love Vanessa when you married her? If you love someone once, you can love them again, I know it. My friend Leah has gone out with the same guy, like, four times. You're just not trying.
Do you find that this approach usually works, or, let me guess, you've never tried it before. In fact, you don't normally approach girls, am I right? The truth is that you're a quite, sensitive type but if I'm prepared to take a chance I might just get to know the inner you: witty, adventurous, passionate, loving, loyal, a little bit crazy, a little bit bad, but, hey, don't us girls just love that?
Well, what's wrong, boy? Cat got your tongue.
Ssshh!
Shut up.
I did not mean to weep again. Why should I weep for joy?
I was thinking tonight -- do you remember, Dick? Do you remember when you used to drive me on dates with the other boys? You didn't want to let me out of your sight.
Why don't we go down to Key Biscayne together? Just the two of us.
No, you're not. So stop comparing yourself to him. You have no reason to ... You have everything you ever wanted. You've earned it. Why can't you just enjoy it?
Yes, it's been a long time ...
Then what are you scared of, honey?
I'll be careful, darling. You be, please.
Don't tease me.
Time and faith... . My brother's dead and you stand there talking drivel about time and faith.
How could anyone do this to Joey. The best in the neighborhood... . everybody said it, not only me. Who'd want to harm Joey? Tell me who? -- who?
What do you want, Melvin?
What do you want?
Just ignore her, Mac.
This phoney war get's on my nerves. If we're going to have a war, I wish they'd get it started.
I doubt if a few bombs would wake up Dawn on a Sunday morning.
So you were unhappy?
Hmmm?
But why not?
Not at all?
Oh...
I don't want to fight, George.
He had one tiny, uncharacteristic moment of weakness. That's not the same thing as a lifetime of petty crime...
Yes, everybody is in love with John Bubber. The whole country, in fact. And they're not going to be happy if he jumps to his death because he was harassed by a lousy little money-grubbing low-life fence...
If anything happens to John BUbber, Mister LaPlante I'm going to see you prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
I bet. He didn't realize that nobody who talks such a good game ever plays one.
I'm afraid I spoke out of turn last night.
Look, Tran... Lenny just came by to give me some bad news. An old friend of mine has been murdered. You remember Iris?
More or less.
I'm sorry. It's for the flowers. Why don't you...
This fence...it's so...
Wait! Don't go...
Of him I think.
It's me. What is it?
Tuna, this is crap.
I'm not the one who put this scar here.
Who said I'm not getting recruited?
It's garbage.
Hello, Mr. Sheldrake. On that Bases Loaded. I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. But I wouldn't bother.
That's funny -- I never knew you to lose that much before --
What are you doing here? Please... leave... you can't stay here...
Duff - you know those women you used to know--
Caesar, what are you going to do?
Sort of.
What time?
Yes ... It's just that ...
Okay.
Would it? She kisses him, very softly, on the lips.
Just gettin' rid of the garbage.
No, I'm serious. You know what Kurt Potter is? He's the kind of guy who never would have taken this case in the first place. He's the kind of guy who would have sold these plaintiffs down the river when PG E offered 20 million. He doesn't work like us, Ed. There's no little voice in his head telling him to do the right thing.
Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong. And I want to have a little fun.
I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
No last names. Just Domino. The less you know about me the better, okay?
You can save that Pretty Woman shit. The name is Domino.
Have a nice day.
Do you love him, Loretta?
A wolf without a foot!
I am looking where I should to become a bride!
Because I have no Luck!
No!
Yes she is, but she's very upset, so she's not seeing anyone.
Do you think I should tell my dad about Jeffrey Pommeroy?
Can you swim?
He's in the living room asleep.
Well maybe she'll feel better in a couple of days.
Clarence, would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?
God, it's so like your father. Why can't people take responsibility for their actions anymore? I can almost forgive him for killing Simone -- but denying her existence. I can never forgive that.
I know it as surely as you're sitting here, sweetheart. She was the most vital woman I ever met.
Of course. What are you suggesting?
Good night Enzo, Good night Jacques.
... It's a comfortable place.
The Mamma's there too.
Oh, Jabez -- it was a wonderful day --
But I'm glad to be home again --
It's time somebody ate them .
I'm late for lab.
Right. 7:30.
Remember, that poet that we liked the reading he's doing at Big Cup? I got us tickets.
Daddy, it's a letter to me .
uhh, must have forgotten-
Hey, where's your sweatshirt?
Nope.
Maybe putting your nose in other people's business?
Don't you miss it?
With a sitter. We have a sensational sitter. Jonah's really comfortable with her. You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family. Amazing with kids.
So where is young Jonah?
Another satisfied client?
Not for a second. Cal can have all that.
So this sitter can always reach me. I'm still not used to leaving him.
What is that thing?
"... used as an anesthetic if given in combination with paracin trichloride... "
It's a soporific.
How do you spell it?
How often does one of our clerks have business in the house of records?
And Burgel is the bringer of messages, isn't he?
He used to like me -- very much more than I liked him.
Or what if there really was an error? -- I don't know what kind -- any kind that needed correcting -- and what if Burgel was responsible for it? One mistake -- even a small one in a firm like ours -- it could cost him a promotion.
She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
Why are you so hostile?
Is that Paul Goodman? No. And be nice to the host because he's publishing my book. Hi, Doug! Douglas Wyatt. "A Foul-Rag-and-Bone Shop-of- the-Heart."
Commentary.
Can I ask you kind of a weird question?
I'm not suggestin' that! I'm not goin' back. No matter what happens. So don't worry about me.
Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most?
Yeah.
Now what what?
Now what?
Oh, I don't know, Thelma. I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays. Maybe we could have children with the prison guards.
Whaddo we do?
Before.
You mean now or before?
But you're going skiing with us Yankees, aren't you?
At Christmas. To Cortina with Freddie Miles and --
Everybody knows Freddie Miles.
Well, with a shark running loose around the place, I for one won't get aboard that raft! They'll have to catch it first. I want to see it right here before my feet, dead or alive.
He sees himself in me! Romeo Montague, a young man of Verona.
A comedy of quarreling families reconciled in the discovery of Romeo to be the very same Capulet cousin stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother that was robbed of her own child by the Pirate King!
Better dead.
What are you wearing?
Kiss me.
Good.
I don't think we'll go to war. We shouldn't even be here. This isn't our fight, it's a regional conflict. It should be decided regionally.
Don't call them that.
I'm going to call the police.
Really? And how are you, eh? Someone called Pierre Dreyer said that a month ago he had dinner with a Brazilian friend of...
Can you help us?
Why, there certainly is. You must see a doctor, I insist on it. Please, let us take you.
... Won't you let us do something for you? Your leg should be examined, we could take you to a hospital.
Don't you like that?
Yeah. Like I said, I don't want to take sides. And I like Laura with you. She's more fun, more open. You guys are good together. I just wish you two could, I don't know. I don't think much of this Ian guy --
How're you holding up?
No, just so I can see ya, ya know. Don't have to turn my neck.
No, no, that's fine.
Well, they're a good outfit.
I'll tell you what I'll do. I get thirty dollars a week. I'll take twenty-five, twenty if necessary. I'll do anything you say.
Oh, I can do that. I know this town inside out. Oh, give me a chance, please.
Do you really have to go?
This is me in the eighth grade. Did you have Mr. Deegan?
Sandro, listen... Try not to get yourself too involved tomorrow.
Not the Maxine?
It means being without money.
There's nothing wrong in admitting that you want me, Frank.
You and me -- making love.
Or maybe... did you ever think that deep down we really might be lesbos? Maybe that's why we spend so much time together.
Where have you been?
I cannot believe you are saying this? You, who I have relied on all this time --
How do I look?
I'm Bella.
Hi, Jack. Welcome to the cesspit.
I love to swim, and I don't mind the cold at all. It's invigorating.
Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because...
Such as my man and how to please him! Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! Such as looking pretty for my man! And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal!
I had sold my fucking soul.
That was wonderful!
You were wonderful today, darling. Such authority with the ape-man boy. It made me so hot for you.
You don't.
Would you like to see that?
-- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck. One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't. Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us.
That's right!
Sure.
She s your dog, Jack.
And to you, Mr. Andrews.
Here you go...
Where all meat come from -- now git yourself washed up and be snappy about it -- you got six miles ahead of you to that school.
Jack...
No, why should I? It's yours.
Eddie, what's in that case?
Oh, it's not bad.
Oh, cut my finger.
Eggs. How do you like them?
The bills are right here. You didn't say what you wanted.
Don't come that bloody flannel with me. If you're a traveller, I'm bloody Twiggy. And who's he?
What are you doing? Where's George?
Susan, I want you to stop this. And right now!
Well, I'm not going to stop it. I'm going to say exactly what I think. You've never given me anything. You've tried to buy me into giving you something. You're - - it's like you were bribing me! That's what it's been from the first moment I met you. No matter how much it cost you - your time, your money - that's what you've done with everybody you've ever known. Tried to bribe them!
Susan!
You're talking an incredible amount of nonsense, Susan. Whatever I do - I do - because I love you.
Love! You don't love anybody! Me or anybody else! You want to be loved - that's all you want! I'm Charles Foster Kane. Whatever you want - just name it and it's yours! Only love me! Don't expect me to love you -
You'll never have another chance to hit me again. I never knew till this minute -
Susan, it seems to me -
No, no.
Oh, fine.
Oh, pretty good. They bitin'?
What?
Now Nick, what's that got to do with it?
Who do you think did it?
George!
Mimi!
I don't remember.
Yeah, um, then...are you alone?
What?
Him?
For what?
Tell me about Lina Moebius.
Which thing?
Bullshit.
Who did it?
You're crazier than I thought, Lenny. Coming here... Tran's just in there.
College?
What am I supposed to do, check in every two seconds?
What is it? Has he found him?
Oh, here she is.
Nothing.
I think every time I see a climbing tree i'll think of Thomas J.
He's all right. Isn't that enough?
Why'd you come to the house the other night?
NASA. Plus we have these really fun pizza study groups, and we go to-these all county meets. And, I mean, not that you need it, and without sounding too much like the Godfather, I think we could offer you a certain amount of protection", if you know what I mean. We all kind of stick together and watch out for each other.
I am not talking to you, bitch.
Arbogast! Sam, he liked me... or felt sorry for me... and he was starting to feel the same about you. I heard it when he called... in his voice, a caring. He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done anything without telling us. Unless he was stopped. And he was stopped, so he must have found out something!
From you?
Sam, if you owned a useless business like this motel... one you probably couldn't even sell... what would you need to get away, to start a new business, somewhere else? Forty thousand dollars?
Yes... a half-steed... white.
I am sent by God, and I submit all my words and deeds to His judgment. Or do you think that you are better judges than He is?
Five steeds and a few hackneys...
My king.
It's interesting.
No.
Jimmy... it's beautiful!
Maybe.
It's nothin' like that.
Stop it! Stop it, Jimmy, or I'll leave right now. I'm not kiddin'!
C'mon, Frank. What are you doing?
No . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over- throws life. Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. Love like there has never been in a play. I will have love or I will end my days as a . . .
Well... It's beautiful country, I'll give you that. And I could see having some kind of vacation place. Retreat. But I don't know how you do it full time. Don't you miss the rest of the world?
-- what? -- I'll see you later...
What he said..."There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result."
Gee, that is a problem.
Put that down, I'll...I'll call the police!
Are you in the middle of something?
I just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.
But you don't have hidden motives for feeling that way, right?
Hi!
I saw you sitting over here. By yourself. I thought, thank God, someone normal, who doesn't know how interact at these things either.
Hi there.
This is California, anything is possible.
How are you?
Are you suffering from a chemical imbalance or is it just an attitude problem.
I'm okay.
How did you know my name?
Where is he?? He was supposed to meet me.
...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive.
Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all.
Four hundred and fifty and I'll cut your throat if you try any tricks!
Most of the time, all three Precognitives will see an event in the same way. But once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the other two.
Obviously, for Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility. After all, what good is a Justice system that instills doubt? It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.
What do you want, Jim?
In the kitchen.
What about you?
What are you going to do to him?
Norman!
What are you looking for?
I want you to forget what I said.
I want to go back to Cape Town, I want to start again, clean.
Next time it'll be my neck.
God.
How old is she?
When you only see someone sitting at a desk all day, it's liable to create a false impression.
Oh, she'll love it.
Call him back. Ask him. I'm a little...busy.
She must have gone out for a walk with the children.
What complicated about it? All you have to do is do what you're told -- what could be simpler than that? I'm the drum on which God is beating out his message -- beating so loudly it's bursting my ears -- but you're all so full of your own voices, you're deaf to His!
Play it, Sam. Play "As Time Goes By."
No, I don't mind. I'm not from here. I was born in Italy.
Uh... uh... Umm... long time.
No, really?
Small town on the Eastern side no one's ever heard of called Bari.
You just... got off the train because it looked pretty?
Where? I don't see a thing.
Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie.
... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older...
... Good night, Chauncey.
... Ben, really...
... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours.
... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you?
Frank's touchy about his cousins. Well, it was nice to meet you, Mr. MacLean.
Oh Frank, don't forget the wedding present -- it's behind the door in the laundry room. I got her a pasta maker from the catalogue... Not that they'll know what to do with it in Branton, Missouri... Probably use it as a planter.
It's so cruel.
Let's talk to whoever can get this over with...
You think I manifested the snakes?
This house, the whole damned area around here is one mass grave... Now you might call me crazy, but there is something negative about the place.
C'mon -- what?
Damn it, look at you! Don't you see what's happening with you? We need to get out of here, don't you understand? Out of this house!
I wanna play a song on the juke. You got a quarter?
What happened to your hand?
Tanner.
Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going to get to his feet in a minute and speak two important words-- Willet Creek . When that happens--if my hunch is right--the Silver Knight will fall off his tightrope and Puss will jump out of his boots.
Ah. One of the supporting characters.
That gorilla in Man's clothing-- McGann.
Yes. Mostly "Puss." Oh, the other prominent character in the play.
The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on a tight-rope.
You play--left field.
Shut your big fat mouth!
I don't think so. Shelly, how can I get thirty five dollars?
It's not a real school, it's a writing class, I wanna be a writer.
It's a mood ring, it tells what mood I'm in.
Ooh, that's a pretty ring you're wearing.
No! No! No! Peggy Sue got married! Case closed. I don't want to marry anybody. Goodbye Richard.
We must do something.
Do something.
Won't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews?
The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean?
Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way.
You have been acting very strange the last few weeks.
I don't know, I'm just so depressed. Everything is just so... depressing.
What do you think it is?
She's there whenever I call her!
It couldn't be.
What do you think it is?
Of course it was Damone. If it was Ron Johnson, you'd be out to here!
It could be. I had a pregnancy test at the clinic. I'll find out Monday. I guess it was Damone.
Because she is my friend.
Why, daddy, you know my friend too!
It means nothin' at all! And all this time I been wonderin' about it!
That's it ?
What? What? What now?
My name is Jeanne. My little cross I had round my neck was taken away from me. I would like to have it back.
Not if what he left me was real.
No, it isn't, Lamar. There was nothing anyone could do.
You look great.
Well, excuse me for caring about words.
"You know..."
Your wife...
I came to work in the garden and I saw you with her...in my house.
I was there.
I snuck back to my car, trying to convince myself it never happened. And when I woke up in the hospital...somehow it hadn't. Until now.
Well, didn't you take, uh... uh, a shower at the club?
Well, I mean, you don't have to, you know.
Yes. Nick!
Now, Ma -- You just try to set an example for me, and keep hold of yourself.
She was just too young for you.
The next trip, when I come with all the money, it'll look like I hand it to the same one I did before...
If you want.
I don't know. One of your friends.
If you just listen, you'll see it's a damn good idea. The first time I do it they're lurking about. They see me hand the ten thousand to someone.
Listen, Mike. You really didn't have to get off the line. I just wanted to ask you one thing. I know I shouldn't have called, I mean, my friends said I should wait two days... Oh God, I probably sound like such a schoolgirl... It's just that it's tonight only... I mean, it's Sinatra's birthday and they have this thing every year at "The Room". Do you know where that is? It's impossible to find if you've never been there. I don't understand why none of the clubs in Hollywood have signs. Anyway, I'm so bad at this, if you're not busy I thought you might...
Eddie, I don't understand. Why are you the most qualified director for the Christine Jorgensen Story?
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat, I'm high maintenance. So I'm not going to tiptoe around your marriage or whatever it is you got going there. If you want to be with me, you're with me.
Why would they tow your truck?
You've been saying that for twenty years. While we were dating, you said it.
Money?
Lucky lady. Hi.
Ours.
NO ! I wouldn't do that.
Yes, Mr. Hillyer, it was. I... I heard strange voices in the night.
Yes, sir.
I will not sit here and listen to you be brutal to this poor girl.
You sending me home?
Oh, Andy.
And I'll give then proof!
Mother!
All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
I tell you -- he didn't do it.
Ruth McHibbon offered to pick you up at the airport.
Why would he ? His parents are rich.
It's me. Can you hear me?
Huh?
No kidding?
The both of them? In there?
Oh. So what's it doing here?
An animal? What kind of animal? A goddamned T-Rex, or what?
It won't even hold the one day, Ronnie --
Oh, yeah?
H'm?
No. You're a wreck.
Yeah?
You're really nuts. I don't know, you really thought it was good? Tell me.
NICK!
You'll find out when I get you home. Thanks, Sam.
Ronald?
What's this? December 8th, 1958?
It's my feeling that you really want to buy this shop, Marty.
Well, yes, George is a wonderful hairdresser.
What's wrong, Danny?
Hello...
Have another drink, Thelma.
I won't wait up.
How do I look?
Are you okay?
You should talk to him about this.
No.
Aren't they?
Who?
No, we just ate. I only remember how tough my father was. Now I know he had to be like that, to make us tough. This city'll kill you if you aren't strong enough.
OK, last night I was weak. it won't happen again. And all that shit I said--it was just because I was stoned. Forget it.
I wish these people would leave already. I can't listen to another story. Did you see him? That doctor says the brain is coming around. They're waiting for the heart to stabilize. I don't know who to believe. He says they still have to keep him tied up.
This is not a good time.
Not since November.
Victor, I, I feel somehow we shouldn't stay here.
Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
Ah.
What could have possessed that girl!
Mister Powell!
Of course I know it's gone. You remind me every day!
Rabbit, Flu-shot, someone talk to me.
Cancer?
Hi.
You've read The Fountainhead?
I question the thinking behind sending the first ambassador to another civilization in armed -- basically announcing our intentions are hostile.
Don't worry. I'll have a cool scar.
Call it xenophobic paranoia. Don't you see the absolute absurdity of this? This isn't about them, it's about us -- our violence, our fear and mistrust --
He's flying to Sicily. His mother's dying.
In a month.
Mm-mm!
How do you know this?
...any sister talk?
No more drapes to hang. Now what should we do?
Don't act so goddamned innocent! You and your own mother, gah! You like to go back where you been, huh?
By God, it's your mother. It's Lilly.
Sure it is. That's why you act so funny around each other.
Bullshit!
What is it? What's going on?
What's happened? Kip! What's happening? Don't shoot, please, don't shoot anybody.
Going back, huh?
I'll take the parasites.
Maybe what?
I said the record is destroyed. The original report exists for all time. I designed the system so that whenever a report occurred, it would be stored in a safe place -- but not declared.
-- I guess it's all got to do with this shop.
listen...listen to me now, Phil: I'm sorry, sorry I slapped your face. ...because I don't know what I'm doing... ...I don't know how to do this, y'know? You understand? y'know? I...I'm...I do things and I fuck up and I fucked up....forgive me, ok? Can you just...
Tell him I'm sorry, ok, yes, you do that, now, I'm sorry, tell him, for all the things I've done...I fucked up and I'm sorry.... And I'm Gonna Turn Away And Walk Now And Not Look At Him Not See My Man, My Earl, I'll leave now...and tell him it's ok and I'm ok. The whole thing was ok with me -- and I know.
What did you do?
How much do I pay him?
If all our assets are frozen and our "sales force" has scattered... How am I supposed to survive? I'm giving birth in three months. How do I get through this?
And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
Okay.
And you be careful, you who claim to be my judges, for you too will be judged one day...!
What?
Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
I love going to movies, especially at the drive in. I don't think there's anything more romantic than going to the drive in. I'll let you get back to work.
Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day.
A girl's always gotta look her best.
No.
Come here, sit down.
Who is he, Pop?
Pop, I'm not ready to go back yet.
You have to learn how to take a complement. Movies, movies, ahhhh, quot;Love Story quot; at the drive in, I cried my eyes out, did you see it?
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic.
No.
We were close to something with Kendall.
In lieu... quot;instead quot;.... No contest.
You have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.
What's your friend's name?
You love him?
I've got to stick by Kit... He feels trapped.
No, it's okay. Believe me, there were plenty of times I didn't know what the hell was right.
Listen Tom, I let my cab go; can I come in to call another one?
When I'm certain, I'll let you know...
I've tried calling and writing. I want to reach Michael.
What was that?
And not a sign of the leopard?
Our first real break -- and we throw wild animals at the audience
How much?
If ye should lead her into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross kind of behavior, as they say: for the lady is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double with her, truly it were an ill thing, and very weak dealing.
What, you growing gills all of a sudden? You got it on, keep it on.
Funny how life repeats itself, huh? Over and over. Like a song.
Yeah.
Sneak out in the morning. Before the guy could wake up and ruin it. Never figured I'd be on the other end of it, though.
Oh, Mr. Dickson - they're going to arrest Matt. They think he did it!
We can't pretend this isn't happening.
Oh God...you knew.
I was down in Adamant...
No way! Forget it. Not an option.
Why didn't you come to me?
Oh, Lotte...
Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
Lotte? Is that you?
Yes, sir.
You don't have any money left, okay?! That's the truth. I don't wanna say it, nobody else will say it, but it's the truth. You spent it all. You can't buy the Tribune in Chicago -- you can't buy g-g- goddamn thing. Now you better face up to it--
A million dollars a year on art and st-st-statues and there's nothing to explain?!
Then you explain it to me?!
You gotta wake up now. Pops.
I'm not asking you to defend anything. But we're in a pickle and we gotta talk about it.
Twice a year.
How do you know this place?
You go slippin' around in front a my face, an' in front a Elton an' Stoney. What do you imagine they think a someone you treat that way...
I'm not some piece a crap.
You treat me like I was.
You're goin' a find me dead one time.
A baby... and she isn't even married.
Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die!
I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied?
What's goin' on?
Thanks. They weren't related to Humpty Dumpty, were they? Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee?
Do you want to go home, Ryan?
I'm worried about my spine. I'm very worried about my brain and my spine.
I love it here. Don't you love it here, Ryan? I love it here. And I love tonight. And I love these people. And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. Utterly fantastic.
Sure you don't want anything?
I'm gonna go in that cafe an' get some coffee. You want anything?
Leave me alone!
Are you still following me?
Yes. Come out, I know you're in there
No. I mean your other secret - the one you kept bidden even from my father. That old doctor in London -- he told me.
I don't know. Everything's so mixed up --
Sometimes when he looks at me in that strange way, I'm afraid of him.
I'm not sure about this.
I know you're afraid of something. We'll be careful. Tomorrow we'll go over there and we'll find out.
Don't be ridiculous! They're just a bunch of harmless old men. My grandfather was in there.
She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson.
They were stained.
How many times have I burned into your thick skull and the thick skull of your fellow novice, that menstruation is a perfectly natural process and nothing to be ashamed of.
No.
I burnt them.
Why?
In the medieval days the nuns and monks would sleep in their own coffins.
We're not in the Middle Ages, Sister.
It made them holy.
If you knew, Leon...! I killed one thousand in my head... And this never disturbed my sleep.
Mommy, could Edward take me to Mrs. Farren's house to give her her present?
Merry Christmas.
I got lots of presents.
A merry Christmas to you, Amy.
Darling, Peter says I could stay
Hey, I don't believe it.
Well, I need grass and so do you.
It's healing now.
I'm going to this stupid art show and I want you to be my date... There's something I have to show you...
Of course you should. C'mon, I'm already a million hours late.
Well forget the art show... let's do something else.
Let's just do it, all right?
Oh, you have my body.
Tell me.
Indeed it is. May I take this She removes his tray.
How're you feeling this morning?
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's assistant.
That you were just indulging me.
What for?
Oh yes. He's really proud of his work.
Tonight?
Oh, thank you, sir!
It feels real good.
This is one of my favorite things, her passport.
Is this Juno?
No it's Morgan Freeman. Got any bones that need collecting?
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.
Maybe it's just a food baby. Did you have a big lunch?
It's not a food baby. I took three pregnancy tests today. I am definitely up the spout.
Only the one in my pants.
Dude, I'm pregnant.
I drank like ten tons of Sunny Delight. Anyway, yeah. I'm pregnant. And you're shockingly cavalier.
I'm sorry, okay? Let's not fi...
Don't touch me! I'm allergic to you!
Well, you certainly had a good look around.
It's great! They're behind you. They feel like they know you.
I hope she's all right.
And your father?
What does that mean?
Going for a pony ride at Kiddielands, want to come along?
A real swinger. He's been trying to fuck me for about two hundred years.
Hi, Leonard.
That's right.
Poster-Kleiser.
Fine.
WE got it back, that's all.
What can I tell you?
I feel so bad. I had nightmares all night long. They all knew you at that place.
I know you are and you don't have to do anything crazy to prove it.
You're not mad at me?
I can't help you there.
Was I wearing something of yours and you got mad at me?
Mom's going to hate it.
Thanks for loading me on the stage. I know now why you did it.
Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving. Now why don't you use that character...
I'm not fucking with you, Norman. You've fucked yourself.
Oh. What happens now?
Of course you're going to deny it. You want to blame someone else. You want to blame Beth. Because you hate Beth.
No.
Later. When I finish the ironing.
No, Estellita.
I've been expecting you; I got a letter from the lawyer.
I talked to Miss Simms. Miss Simms was your caretaker and neighbor after your mother died in 1980.
I was told that your mother died. That your mother died when you were young --
I don't anymore.
That was so weak.
I'm telling you, Coach wishes she was here instead of me.
I don't have it easy like you, alright. There's no red carpet laid out for me.
What are you? A mouse? Get out of the car and do it. This is your chance.
It's just that I fantasize about you and, well, speaking to you now has gotten me sort of excited and...
I like your nails. Where did you get them done?
Ah... I do them myself. I used to work in a beauty parlor.
Yes! They'll be in soon.
Well, I guess I'll come back then.
Wilbur, the adopting couple is waiting in your office.
She was lonely, I talked to her. Norman, I know how it looks, but--
Fine.
Gino travels with a big man named Roy. Caesar calls him the driver.
When?
Oh.
Tonight?
Scotch, Glenlivet. I remember that Caesar made a huge deal about it.
Any bodyguards?
The plane is in at seven, so I'd say about eight.
What time did you say they would be there?
Benjamin -- do you dislike me for some reason?
But I found the money.
I don't know. About three hundred thousand.
Swear to god.
Swear to god, I need to know the truth.
Dad, did you do it? Did you take that money?
What am I supposed to think?
Mummy!
But, what if I go into labor? That could happen any time.
How long will we have to stay down here?
Nathan!
Our Lord said just the opposite.
I'm not.
Tonight, tonight, I...I have play practice...
Your novel? Are you fucking kidding me?
Bobby--! What are you doing up at this hour?
Tell me what?
Now, Bobby, just a minute--
Bobby, you've been dreaming again.
I'm ready.
Sorry.
I'm sorry, baby. I can't help it.
Who's Ted Bundy?
Patrick, have you ever wanted to make someone happy?
What's that?
Are you gonna do it?
Hey, hey, you should ask her out -- what do you think, she's cute, right?
-- do you think you'll ask her out?
It's not cool?
I can't believe it. Oh God, I can't believe it. You're an angel, Auggie. An angel from heaven.
Right. Right.

I had a lunch break so I thought I'd come by and see you. Your teacher is a fox! Why don't we discuss that after class. But the burning is totally normal. Oh look. Class is over already.
Hi!
I don't know.
Something's happened. He isn't trying anymore.
Yes. He called some of the biggest people in town.
You think you're special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?
What is your job title, exactly?
Or stage parents!
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. Have you considered that?
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.
I said, what-is-your-job-title, Missy?
I don't understand it. Even in the wild days she was never as late as this.
Because! Because I've always been faithful to God, and I've followed everything he said... and I've done everything he asked me...
What do you mean, they won't come?
Like... like the wind... and the clouds... and... the bells... and what about that sword lying in the field... that was a sign...!
If it makes you feel any better, I don't think you could've gotten more than ten bucks for all this stuff.
You don't have to show me anything, Mr. Rogers. I believe you.
You don't think I'm going to let this blackmailer intimidate me, do you?
No. And you have to be.
You do not! Roy Dillon? Cornball clown pictures? Commission salesman? It's all a front, isn't it? You're on the grift, I know you are. You're working some angle, and don't tell me you're not because I wrote the book!
And that dump you live in! Those clown pictures on the walls!
That's me. That's who I am. You were never cut out for the rackets, Roy, and if you --
You're a liar. But you upset my plans.
I suppose we could people the world with vampires, the three of us.
Is that supposed to frighten me?
Does it?
How am I going to conduct an interview if I can't ask him any questions?
They took over a club I was working at. Caesar started managing it.
Oh, they'll publish it all right. But that's not going to stop me -
He... He is dead! MY HUSBAND IS DEAD! Call my parents. They ll tell you. Call them!
Do you think we d let him get away with the murder of my brother?
What are you doing? You can t. I...
No. Not us...
Calm down. You're not going to jail.
Holding hands?
I don't see why not.
Saint Mario!
To be known as He!
James will be there . . . and Mario! Only they'll be saints.
I'm not! I'm going to the Fourth World! It's like Heaven, only better because there aren't any Christians.
I wish James would do a religious picture . . . he'd be perfect as Jesus!
Daddy says the Bible's a load of bunkum!
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!
Well, you're catching on.
John Doe.
Then I must have been supplying it.
You won't. You won't have to.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom real quick.
A little longer, Paul?
'Kings and sixes The pot affixes'... Poetry. I learned that at my grandma's knee.
We'll just go in for one minute -- it'll be a riot!
Styles couldn't reassign him, he's a legend --
Please, Seymour... Becky and I have been dying to go in here but we can't get any boys to take us... Please?
Why?!
Oh my god! We have to go in here!
Yes.
I opened the bathroom door one day and saw Miss Lawson pouring Cocaine out of a vial.
That s good but...you did forget the anniversary.
No -- never.
Well, my mother was the only good teacher the colored school ever had. Nobody bothers with those kids.
He, uh, has he been in the "jail" long?
Get away, get away!!
I want to be at one with Him now.
My place faces a truck street. I've got cracks in every window from the shaking.
I've been thinking about that. I've decided to give it to you after I've collected the inheritance. You can take that one if you want -- but there's another copy.
Is that a school?
Don't push me, Frank. I might lose my temper and send it out just for spite.
It's me.
Please open the door, Danny.
We been through that.
Thank you. So Catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.
Thank you.
You told me so. Maybe you'd get some sympathy. You came to the wrong place.
You do what you want. You want to leave... You want to go kill yourself?
You want me to tell you it's your fault? It probably is. What are you going to do about it? I thought it's not over till the jury comes in.
And it's over...?
Well, then what are you doing here?
Yes.
Aren't you going out with Catherine? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. I didn't mean...
Is that what he told you?
I'll help you with the coffee.
Huh?
Oh Chet, that feels fabulous,
I was looking in one of your magazines and saw that picture of the couple getting married at the Pyramids. Were you ever in Egypt?
I was there for that shot, actually.
Oh, Tom, of course. What are you doing in Nashville?
Well, part of what I said in this entire history of my life which you won't read is that somehow you've done more for my mother, my son and me, than anyone else ever has... And that makes you the most important, surprising, generous person I've ever met and that you be in our daily prayers forever.
I didn't. I just realized I already knew.
Yes. Who's this?
Who is this?
I'm not sure. Where?
Yes.
Oh, hi, I mean hello, we've met.
If you really believe in God, why is it so inconceivable that his enemy is just as real?
Thank you for being honest.
Are you sure you parked it there?
And the jacket?
I'm not very happy with you right now, Grady. But more importantly, Walter's not very happy and he's gotten the police involved. They seem to think James Leer is somehow responsible for all of this. You wouldn't happen to know where James is, would you, Grady?
They talk to you?
You see ghosts, Cole?
We're taking back the Tourelles!
Yes, She's a little odd, I understand.
I should really give him a call. He's a character, isn't he. Well, not to you. I meant to us squares in the outside world.
I gave him yours. Said, here, you want to write, I think this is a relative. I guess I thought I was being true to Jenny. Who told me she didn't have a father -- before proceeding of course to tell me why.
I might've been away for the weekend.
And you've seen Eddie Rama.
Were you still married at the time -- to Jenny's mother, I mean?
Can I please have a cup of coffee?
We don't have any coffee.
What is this? The Betty Ford Center?
Annabelle, how's your video rep...
What happened with Annabelle? Has nothing I said gotten through to you?
Maybe you could back off just a little bit --
What did you do?
Nothing. Look, I want to talk to you about...well...Luke said to ask you...
She's been talking about this little editing machine, it's only...
What if I do?
In the service you do, but we're not particularly in the service right now. Way I see it, what we're doing, that doesn't particularly give you the right to toss orders around.
You've got an awful lot of orders in you. Always giving orders.
Good morning.
Four years. I came over from the Capitol merger in Chicago six months ago.
Actually it's down .2 from the last quarters highest, but I think it will pick up.
Get lost Bobby.
I was right behind you, but you're too dumb to turn around. If he turned around he might get dizzy and fall down.
Sorry.
Everything is wrong.
Yeah, I guess so.
I know.
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
Alright. Where's the Met?
Alright.
I... a... slept with my fianc 's brother.
Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fianc , and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
He was in a 4G Negative dive and you were on his six?
Where were you?
Lieutenant, I have a top secret clearance. The Pentagon sees to it that I know more than you.
If you were directly above him, how did you see him?
Here he comes.
Oh, I suppose you is a doctor, Homer?
Exactly.
Yeah, it sounds lame. Why would we want to go there, and stand around?
How did you know?
Stop.
Who's gonna do that?
Then you're safer in here.
... but it won't cover Annabelle Daniels's medical bills.
What kind of things come up?
So what are you thinking?
Whoa. No shit.
All right, all right. Doll and Waski are upstairs taking their nap, you go get them and bring them down to the living room. Where is the girl?
Are you all right?
I'm going to hang up now, Miles.
Miles, I don't care if you come to the wedding or not.
Miles, maybe it is better if you don't come to the wedding.
You always were a son-of-a-bitch, weren't you? A little weasel with a quick, dirty mouth.
I don't want to talk about it. If you really want to know. I lost it. And I'm not sorry I did. That eye was cursed, Auggie, and it never gave me nothing but grief.
This is private, Auggie. Just between you and I.
You're kind of a sellout, aren't you? What would the Melvins say?
What if I've figured a way?
Oh.
Like what?
No shit. Like Johannes Brahms?
I am really sorry about this.
Yes. But do you know?
I swear, before yesterday, neither one of us would have ever pulled a stunt like this. But if you ever met my husband, you'd know why I just can... You wanna step out of the car, please? You wanna put your hands on your head, please? Louise, shoot the radio.
Shoot the radio!
That's right. Our motives are selfish, so we're cooperating.
County water board. All righty, thanks.
Somewhere in between.
I don't know.
You want this ticket?
Your thumb tells the driver that you want a ride.
You keep this. Now this is hitch- hike... You stand on the side of the road, the highway... you understand? And you face the cars going in the direction you want to go. When you see a car or a truck coming, you stick out your thumb like this...
Not every car, but... a car will stop... Maybe not the first car... maybe number eight, number fifteen...
You propose to a woman you should offer her a ring of engagement.
Okay...
You promise not to say anything?
Well, good to see you, Miles. Jack.
Oh. I was putting the...
I can see why.
I'll bet he's got an opinion on the stock market too. This apartment is already ahead of its time. I call it the "demolished" look. They've already heard about it at House and Garden and they're coming next week to photograph it before it gets... lived in. Is that alright? I'd love to have it in my portfolio.
That's in two days.
I hate to tell you this but they cancelled this bus line two years ago... There are no buses on this street.
Goodnight, Joe.
Jaeger?
Why!? Because, I'm having thoughts I hardly know what to do with. I... can't seem to... stop them.
Where? Near the doorway or the near the front of the church?
And arraccinos and zeppolis. Yes! I know it!
You will. You'll get it.
Hey, I'm not --
What "all females"? If I'm the only --
Pardon the hour, sir. But you told me to come to you immediately if I felt I was being mistreated in any way.
It's you, sir. And it started the day I came here.
Maybe not, but it is the truth. And Zack, you didn't kill him either.
Am I wrecking my car?
Never mind. That is so awful that they hide your cars.
Maybe even my destiny.
I wonder if he's just totally insane and he really thinks a bus is coming or --
Me?
You can't do this! Max! Max! ... I can't face life without you, and I'm not afraid to die, you know.
Try being named after a guitar- playing pussycat.
That bastard!
Who told you that?
There, there. Don't you upset yourself --
Oh. So you were just pretending to be an asshole.
Buzz off. Go patronize somebody else.
A walking penis capable of intelligent speech. A dickhead.
We? I'm going home. And, judging by that coat, I'd say you have to get back to the barber college.
Forget it. I'm sick of working for that dickhead.
You're lost?
If you want to stay you'll have to exercise a little self-control, and be a bit more humble to everybody.
What's in Big Sur?
Swear on my life.
I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation.
Up the coast.
What job?
What are you doing here?
I wasn't asleep!!
Is it a secret what you're doing here?
Because...
The man from Sloan's is coming. I called you about it.
I will hide you in the room where we sleep, said Candaules. She stumbles over the word.
Yes, thank you, Gyges, son of Daskylus - Candaules said to him I don't think you believe me when I tell you how beautiful my wife is. And although Gyges replied he did find the Queen magnificent the King insisted he would find some way to prove beyond dispute that she was fairest of all women. Do you all know this story?
When my wife comes to lie down she always lays her garments one by one on a seat near the entrance of the room, and from where you stand you will be able to gaze on her at your leisure
Candaules you're laughing at me.
But then the Queen looked up and saw Gyges concealed in the shadows. And though she said nothing, she shuddered. The next day she sent for Gyges and challenged him. And hearing his story, she said this -
Do you feel sorry for the girls you have killed
It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees.
You do?
Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise.
Well, come on in.
Tonight, don't worry about yesterday's game, the recruiters, or anything else. I just want you to enjoy being beautiful. Will you do that?
I gotta find Chet. Make yourself at home.
Did you cry when your father died?
Who's winning?
You wouldn't want to hear a lot of what comes into my mind about myself and Mr. Charlie Kane.
I had a toothache.
How do you want to handle the whole thing - ask questions?
Oh please.
"I actually feel good about myself?"
What do you want me to tell you, Monica, to go beat that girl up? To go have sex with him? I'm not going to do that. Yes, I believe thinking of other people is important and yes I'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. If that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.
So that's why we can't get along? Because I'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?
Find out where they're registered and send them a gift.
Whatever.
...how do we explain that? With the World Watching.
Everybody! Annie has an announcement --
Walter and I are engaged!
-- because Irene threatened to put the dog to sleep if he didn't --
-- who is the most competitive woman in the world --
I hope he doesn't get out his slides.
They're going to love you.
But you've tested it?
What if it attacks?
High Voltage?
What do we use for defense?
You know, we know each other.
Hello, there!
But...
He's never forgotten a promise to me. I'm worried about him. I know something's happened to him.
Shouldn't we go to the cops? I mean, I think we should tell the police.
I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
She already hates me. You've seen to that.
I didn't do it for you. Believe me.
I'm sorry. Look, I'm not real comfortable being here, but...
...in.
Get the car!
Jesus Christ! Louise, you shot him.
West. Left.
Shit! I... I, which way?
Louise. Where are we going?
I suppose any note, no matter how sour, is a song if you hold on to it long enough.
The king said you're his finest archer...?
Not for long...
Smile, little sister, smile.
...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face.
I don't know. But you and I already know that he has saved lives.
Bruckner's Seventh, Major.
He came to see Mr Kinnear.
I look at my kids in school--tenth, eleventh graders. That's who we were. Children.
Don't point it at James!
Well, I was goin' to, but Bobby said he hadda kind of feel things up here first, which I can understand, but then it went an' took so long, I ran flat outa money... I didn't have no number to call, you know. So I hadda clear outa there an' come on up here, in the hopes that I wouldn't be intrudin' myself...
Well, thank you, that's a very nice thing for you to say.
What?
We thought we were something, didn't we?
...You're hurting me...
Every time you and Marlon--
Johnny, I have something to tell you.
You... Jesus Christ!
I can t believe this... What s coming now, eh? If I don t pay all Hell s gonna break loose, is that it?
Is this some kind of sick stunt? Let me guess. You want money, right?
I don't suppose one of us could stay with him. In case he... In case he wakes up, one of us should be there.
Your father had a stroke. He's upstairs with your mom and Dr. Bennett.
I beg your pardon.
I like "godsend."
I think maybe we're missing the point. It seems to me James' strength as a writer is that he doesn't take us by the hand. He treats us like adults. He respects us enough to forget us. That takes... courage.
You will help me with my other problem.
I brought these walnuts to trade.
Will they give him a trial?
If he files are you going to take the case?
She sounds like quite a woman.
That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- "Everything that's wrong with you is in your head." I suppose that's true.
About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit.
Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve.
I saw it. I saw it in your eyes.
You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you?
...Yes, sort of a birthmark...
The fuck I'm not. I don't care what the doctor says --
When? Where?
I know you think it complicates your work, but I'm here to help.
Attendant. He'll give us gas. Put the gun down. Under the seat. Under the seat...
Oh God! You're going to get us both killed. Okay... in your pocket...
In your pocket, please...
Okay.
Oh that... It's a flaw in the iris...
You're lying.
No.
We'd go to his car.
Hello, darling.
Yes -- yes -- yes.
And now?
But now, you must go... I give you the pearls. But now you must go ---
So --
Weird.
Well that's great. There goes MIT.
Why did he come to you?
It's Beaumont.
I don't know. I've never thought about it... what was the most exciting place you've ever been to? Unless you're tired of talking about it.
My children. And Richard didn't like my working.
I'd like to think so. I know one of them went on to Medical school.
I didn't mean that the way it sounded.
A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other honeymoon in a coal mine!
Yes, sir. It was a very unusual automobile. It was a Cadillac, but it had water buffalo horns where the bumpers should be. And what to drink?
I'm sorry, sir, I'm engaged to be married. My boyfriend would be mad if I went out with another man.
You mustn't take it so badly.
It's about me and David.
I'm sorry, I've never seen any of them.
Don't you ever stop?
The bank. OH MY GOD, I FORGOT TO MAKE THE DEPOSIT!
Is there anything you want to tell us, honey?
You? No.
In a minute. They're outside with Esther. I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you.
Take that back.
I know it's yours.
You sing. All the time.
Actually, you sing.
Comb my hair out later, honey.
No, baby... I'm glad you're coming tonight.
Right now, I just don't care.
A friend dropped me off.
Buddy, I am wandering in a wilderness, lost. I just feel awful. Do you mind if I get in bed with you for a little while?
Well ... ... Your father would never do anything like that.
What?
You sure you want to know this?
Yes.
Yes.
Goodbye, my boy. Take care of Dorothy. Show her that there is such a thing as a happy marriage.
Wel-l-l, it seems he has a secretary.
George.
High school and college, yes. Pretty hokey, huh? I knew on our first date this was the man I was going to marry. God... he was the funniest man I'd ever met.
It's only eight o'clock.
He could live with us.
Not here! They can see.
What Kendall said -- "the type of guys you don't feel comfortable going to sleep around." That's what Dunbar said about Childs to the letter.
They got their stories straight.
No, no. It's fine.
Toby! Toby Tucker, leave him alone!
Positive. Hardy, they planned this.
Never say 'never' -- it's not fair to say 'always' -- and no name calling. Use your words.
Nothing.
When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down.
What is it?
I'm afraid not.
I did her hair.
We have to go into that cabin and search it, Sam... no matter what we're afraid of finding and no matter how much it may hurt.
Daddy?
How about if you record over the one we already made? You could have the same date and not use another tape. Who would know?
Just--bang--we have a honeymoon.
Have you got my dough?
Come on with that money!
Sor-ry We have to do something. He can't wake up half done.
Well, what should we do?
This guy's only half cooked. There's no time to fuck around, Stan.
No. I don't think they all did what I did.
You are in serious trouble.
Ann, I don't understand why this freaks you out so much. You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't bother me, why should it bother you?
I don't want to discuss it.
Then why do you keep asking about it?
Ben likes to be read to. Do you know Dr. Seuss...?
Yes. To plan for the picket line tomorrow.
All right, but later. I've got a meeting now.
Good. Come in, we'll work it out. Sit down, sit down.
No, no ... the Sheriff had enough of us. We drove him crazy.
I always wondered what the world would be like. But now that I've seen it, I don't need to see any more. It's all right. Once I'm in the tank, I won't remember any of this.
I am going back. I see myself there.
I have to go back.
The other two will die without me.
Oh-kay...
Are you going to leave me too?
Oh, I can't be the cause of anything between you and Hannah. I jus--
What do you expect me to say?
Why, you know the situation.
Not because of me, I hope.
Wh-- She's never said anything, and we're very close. She'd tell me such a thing.
There's nothing for me to do here anymore... I don't belong here I want to be with Him now...
Wow. It's packed.
Louise, is that you?
You're a vision, Louise, a goddamn vision of loveliness, you always are.
Well, next time you talk to him, tell him to pay his actresses more.
She thinks so. What do you do?
He's such a loser!
It's, uh, you never know--
Oh, he's such a loser!
He's not a loser at all!
Oh, perfect! He reminds me of Ichabod Crane. His Adam's apple keeps jumping up and down whenever he gets excited. HANNAH Listen. He's a lot better than your ex-husband. He's got a good job. Would you light those, please? He's-he's-he's not a dope addict or anything.
He's the headmaster of Daisy's school.
But you've stamped this form before! Why won't you stamp it now?
And is that what you're going to do? Is that what you're going to do...?
Oh, okay. Like this.
You do?
That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
Don't see me to my door, there's no need.
Who is he?
Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared!
Right.
I get the feeling they came more for the potroast than the apterids.
Ironic, don't you think? These guys can hatch hundreds of offspring in a single clutch of eggs, right? And here we are...
Yeah. Yours?
It's alright. I think he got the message anyway.
Do you think you could be a little more forceful next time?
Muncie.
What right? Do you want me to tell you?
YOU KNIT?
It's just for a couple of months.
Dunois... was it you who ordered the attack? Answer me?!
Hello.
I'm not used to that kind of treatment.
I've never been treated that way, and I'm not going to start now.
George.
They want me to go to Egypt for three weeks.
Oh, him. Well, he died.
Top shelf, is it?
Can I undress and talk at the same time?
What about the Mayor?
The driveway's on my side of the house.
Mom liked it.
One year he had a solar system named after her...
Let's go, Duff.
That's impossible. I'm a doctor, I'm --
Patients have visitors, not doctors.
Thank you, Wilson. That will be fine.
But, uh, Egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. It's like going back in time. I remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and I felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. Ha, I never realized how hard it was to describe.
I'd love to go there one time...
It's my subway defense system.
I'm always here for you.
I'm here.
Yeah.
All right.
Yeah, right. Fucked.
I am.
Yeah.
You mean, like a trip?
He killed her. I'm not crazy. He killed her and--
Kill him.
Oh... no, no, no, no, uh, uh. No.
I was hoping you would call me, but... Anyway I decided not to wait. I was thinking, it might be nice to go to dinner together.
What's your name?
Anything is possible.
When she said it, there was something familiar...but no.
I can't let myself fall in love with you.
"...are close to naming the man they believe actually killed Jimmy Chin"?
"Dowd also reports that his team of private investigators..."?
I want it understood.
I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
You always get what you want?
And now?
Twenty minutes!
I don't think that's funny!
Clyde Fitch, thought you may not think so, was well before my time!
So you've pointed out, so often. So many qualities, so often. Her loyalty, efficiency, devotion, warmth, affection - and so young. So young and so fair...
She's a girl of so many rare qualities.
The moment I saw you.
Not now, my dear. I'm playing three no trump.
It was a Ford, Benjamin.
I don't think we were the first.
Oh my God.
What?
I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you!
Actually. I could only help him.
Wrong answer --
See, I just take your gun to the morgue and fire it into one of their skulls; then I call every newspaper in the country with the story about how Senator Kendall's gay son went nuts on a training mission --
What.
It will and you know why? Because you're not a person anymore, you're a cadet in the United States Army; you have no identity, no Miranda warning, and no rights. So I'm gonna throw you to the wolves, and unlike you, I'm gonna get away with it, because you're pissing me off!
Enjoy your flight to Washington --
There's something pathetic parked in front of my house.
Fuck that.
You got to tell em that you saw the accident. Don't you?
But that's what happened.
You are looking unseasonably hot. Let's go inside and grab your rocks.
She's young. She'll get over it.
Frank. Frankie.
You should break all my fingers, Creasy, then tape them back together. I won't be able to play the piano, but I could still swim.
You could have told me any time you were Jacqueline's husband.
A poet. He's sitting right over there. That's his table the one at the feet of Dante.
Hello again.
I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
But no one knew until after...
It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
I don't know. I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. And when you left, all I wanted was...
Every time I'm on the lunch yard, and he's with twelve of his retarded dorkface little adoring out-crowd henchmen...
I don't know what she's talking about. I never said any such thing.
I should be going anyway.
Of course.
What was her major?
Five hundred.
Never saw the point of 'em.
Paperclip?
Better idea...
Ah.
That's...a comfort to hear.
You were very nervous.
I remember you...in the elevator.
The battle is over. The war is over. You've won!
You need to come home!
I've been overseeing production myself for the past three years, you'll be surprised at how wonderful our oil has become.
Who else? I'm the one who runs the estates while you're here risking everything we have for the glory of Rome! Or for the glory of you!
You must have been very proud.
Do you have great devotion for the Virgin?
Where will you live?
Look, I wasn't serious about you taking Sam, so you don't have to get into any actual construction to get out of it.
Friday...God, I hate the thought of him home all day.
He doesn't want to spend the weekends with you anymore.
Take care.
Don't do anything silly.
Is it pretty?
Yes...
What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
That's cool.
Now, what do you want?
Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
What subject? That I wasn't there to take crap from you and bring you eggs? Do you have any control over how creepy you allow yourself to get?
Are you totally gone? This is my private home...
What are you doing here?
My son is sick, okay?
Well, you showed them. You're rich and famous and successful. And you have a beautiful wife.
You know, I never told anybody this, but I always had a feeling that when you die, before you go to heaven, you get a chance to fly around high school for a while.
Well, if it's any comfort, I's goin' in to there to act a fool baby. Straight rockin' heat and slayin' niggas --
Got hit twice.
Like a mafucka.
Mmm-hmm... and your boy very well mighta been one of 'em.
I probably woulda busted on you too... and what a shame that woulda been.
"I can call them... I can call my dad... "
"My parents are right upstairs! They think you've left..."
"So... surprise"...
"Get out! Get out before I call my dad ... he trusts you ... your his best friend. This will be the end of everything... "
"What about you? What will your dad think about you?"
Oh, Jabez! ... Did you hear, Mr. Webster? -- Now you'll help him, won't you?
Are you trying to get me wasted so you can take advantage of my womanly charms?
Be still!
Why?
Can I come in?
I guess.
Yes!
You might have killed him!
What guy?
You are, Holly. Stop it.
Right.
Thanks. So... do we talk about this... or what?
Thanks, Stan.
You made me have an abortion.
Well, I'm not really sure what you're trying to say. It's funny, I suppose. But it seems glib and facile to just make fun of how idiotic these people are.
You're still jealous.
You and your touchy investors.
Really? How about starting with tonight?
One brother, one sister.
Yeah.
It's fine.
What are you lookin' for?
ok.
About two years ago.
It's the Gestapo. They say they expect to be in Paris tomorrow.
Ten years ago? Let's see... ...Yes. I was having a brace put on my teeth. Where were you?
Julliard, yeah.
OK.
Yeah.
Thanks.
Actually, I never rode Western. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
I think Cancer's make the best lovers. My whole family are air signs.
Yes.
What are you doing here?
Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose?
He never killed nobody. He's a Libra.
So you feel like coming into a lady's room -- and you come... What now?
Up the trail.
Why do you hide in my room?
Because you love me -- you love me?
I was so alone -- always alone -- and suddenly you were there and said that. No. I am not afraid. It is strange.
Nerves -- just nerves. You must forgive me. I have had a bad evening. I am very tired. Do you know what it is to be tired -- tired of a routine existence?
Cathy - how does it feel to have a father?
Don't tell me -- was she killed?
Take good care of it.
Not so! No. I think I've been very supportive. I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice.
Me, too.
Come one Will. I just want to know.
So, do you play the piano?
Don't.
Steve, I'd rather you didn't say anything for a day or two...until I tell my brother...
Mrs. Simmonds.
I have to go back now.
Uh, huh...Yeah...
I'm scared.
I have to go back.
It's Madison Fra--
Do you have to call me that?
Ha! What a load of crap. Look at yourself, Caesar. You're a thug. You launder money for the mob. You rent women like you rented this apartment.
Everything you couldn't.
Let us go and we'll make a deal.
That took guts.
You're not.
He wouldn't use around me. I don't like any of it.
Sam took them to a movie.
He's not gay. I found out purely by accident, believe me.
That would be the reason.
So it's like you want to be secret friends.
Yes. And?
Oh. Just not at school...
You haven't even looked at them once.
When will you be going?
It's the lights. And the scotch.
Yeah, when's he coming?
You could've come over.
I hate that.
No. I'm not going to the van, it's so gross. Come on. I'm doing my performance right now.
Hey, Tim.
I feel different right now.
I'm not going to marry anybody.
Tom, you mustn't -- ! You don't know what you're doing! It isn't just you and Mr. Carpenter. The rest of the world, is involved!
Sort of. Sometimes. You're not building an obsession about Steven, are you? Look. I understand opening- night jitters, but you've got one of the great actors in American theater starring in your play.
This is your place.
You're late!
No.
This is where we're going!
Steven goes to extremes to protect his privacy. No friends. No phone.
... Mike.
What's this?
It's a portfolio of my work.
Your pictures. Can I see 'em?
Sure.
Took 'em all.
That's me.
I don't know.
What?
He's a great poet.
Tonight we open new doors.
But doesn't Jacques dive without anything?
What's that little air bottle on the machine?
Jacques, you set a world record.
Yes, son. You better get back to bed.
Can't sleep?
I've been in a horrible accident. This is a coma-induced nightmare.
But you'll be away from home for days -- what will you do when the dark comes, where will you sleep? I can't send you away from here like that!
No, I don't and I oughtn't not to after the way you've taken over since they took him away -- and I would like for you to see 'im so you can come back and tell me about 'im. The field's all planted, so I guess I can spare you for a little while. When do you wanta leave?
He came to see Mr. Cluett.
I can't do it anymore.
Take your time, Jer.
Let her carry this shit inside.
Nobody's helping me. Tommy got four years. Marty and Fran are broke. I asked your friend Remo for the money he owed you, and you know what he told me?
Well, shall we start looking over the paperwork? Gerta has already drafted some preliminary documents.
Well, I was born to be a mother. Some of us are.
Jacqueline, you have spoken so often of ending it all, I can't understand why this should be so difficult for you. You have only to drink a little.
Well, haven't you ever felt like you were born to do something?
Yes. Heating and air conditioning.
I want to be a mommy so badly!
You don't say.
From my father. He was the tribe's shaman.
Can I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes you pee like Seabiscuit.
Sure. The powder room down here is being re-tiled, but you can use the master bath upstairs. Go up, then turn left and on your right...
Bisbee, Arizona. The air's good for pensioners and I know where everything is.
Of course, medical! 42.
That's great. I -- didn't know.
Then and now. But not right now.
Look, are you coming or not?
I don't care. As long as you don't expect me to hold your hand.
No. No. Mom wants you to come to the funeral. It's on Friday.
My dad liked you. And Mom never told him we'd split, because he wasn't up to it and... oh, I don't know. I don't really understand it. I think she thinks he'll be able to see what's going on. It's like... He's been through so much, what with dying and everything, that she doesn't want to upset him any more than she has to.
What are you doing out here?
The English??
Doesn't suit you.
Just answer.
Nothing... Tell me, what do you Want out of life?
Of course not. Please.
How much?
It looks fine. How much will it be, with my car...?
Wonderful - like a great release - He was a malignant cancer and I had to remove him - the world is better without him
All right.
Is everything all right?
You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally. It's only five months since Joe came back.
We're fine. We're great. We're having a baby and we're moving to London.
And Cal's this massive adult?
Cal knows who he is. Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight?
Hey, let's sit down. I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin.
Don't try and change the subject. Oh God, it feels great! He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable.
Neither does Joe.
His sister does. Big time. And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article.
You weren't exactly horrified.
I don't have a drug problem.
What did you say about a pet shop?
Right now I'm going to run a hot tub and soak myself.
That's all right, that's all right...
I'm gonna see you tonight...
Sure! Sure! It's gonna be nice! It's gonna be nice! I'll come over tonight to your house, and I talk with Catherine, and you see, everything is gonna work out all right.
Siddown, Thomas, siddown.
What was that you said about a pet shop?
I'll call him, then call you back...If you want you could stay at my place.
Okay, but you don't know what you're missing.
Yes. But -- that was the other night. Now -- I don't think I would.
I'm going to be so happy to get to college. I hear at Northwestern they don't make fun of you for knowing the element table.
I've been asked to compile a log for the investigators--they want to know everyone's whereabouts last night.
Can that be, er, verified? Were you alone?
I call myself Phoebe.
Phoebe.
It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
What about medical?
I'm becoming quite attached to Chauncey - quite attached... ... And so are you, aren't you, Eve.
I changed the lock you son of a bitch!
Yes. I can live in or out just as you wish.
Really.
This is not relaxing.
You're on vacation, remember? You're supposed to be relaxing.
Yeah, me too, mind if I tag along?
"You're playing a dangerous game here. If you're trying to blackmail me... it's not going to work."
"You know what I want...it's not that difficult."
"Really?"
...What?
There's no comparison.
No... Not yet. He's very shy... and very sensitive.
I think you're very sweet, Corrado.
I know what's bugging you, of course.
You don't know what I'd do, Roy. You have no idea. To live.
I'll get it.
No, but I'm goddamn thirsty. Ice water?
Oh, really? You've got a legitimate complaint, Roy, I don't deny that. I wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.
Maybe.
Talk to them! Heavens!
I feel like before I can talk to him I have to see his face.
Hair stuff?
I don't know what to do.
Yes. And so terribly annoying when they cry. I just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?
Buddy, you're just a child.
Well, nothin'.
What do you mean you're hemorrhaging?
I'm hemorrhaging.
Vada, Vada, what's the matter?
Daddy??!?!?!
Well he just left, what's wrong?
Where's Daddy?
Oh, fuck you! Fuck you, Sam Rothstein! Fuck you!
So what? So who fuckin' blew you in the parking lot before you came in... huh?
I wouldn't do that...
I know. I don't understand it either.
I wouldn't -
You finish the reading for E-con?
Thanks, Sidra.
What's up with that?
Hey, don't take it personal. And don't think just cause we play the same position we have to compete with each other. We're teammates, okay?
Coach hates me, doesn't she?
She hates all freshmen.
You can't work if you can't think. You get in bed. It's all right. I'll stay here with you. It's all right. Come on...
What happened...?
...and is that serious?
Do you want me to go...?
Why don't you get some rest?
Why don't you go in and sit down. I have some gifts for you.
Seriously, Ben... I need to keep pretty low-key around here. Maybe next time you could nap this side of the door. That was the landlord.
I cut it on an old rusty knife.
What?
Best way I know to get ink on your hands.
Did as of last week.
That's something a man could do...?
Press still works.
No problem.
And you said...
What else? Keep on keepin' on.
Listen, Toby, I can't really talk right now. Do you mind if I call you back?
Apollo?
Don't you?
My relationship with God is my own.
Do you ever wonder why things happen the way they do?
Wasn't that cowardice?
No, Uncle, and now I'm pleased to have been able to do this favor, because, although I didn't think so at first, you are really a good man.
Yep. How was your trip...? Help me clean up, okay?
Thorpey nearly died laughing.
And what about you? Did you kill Brumby?
What about Keith?
What'll they do to him?
They bloody hurt me.
What you going to do?
I'm a monster. Exactly.
You think this was to hurt you?! My God, Joe. It isn't about you.
Don't make allowances. I'll never be ready. Some people just shouldn't have children. I'd be a terrible fucking mother, Joe. I did want it for us. But I couldn't do it. I don't really think I can do it.
Yeah. See you there.
I know.
So Josh...
...I'm positive this time...
Hello.
Bonita, you shouldn't be discouraged so easily.
And...?
I think you must have had a love affair with her...
And these were drawn from life?
You liked this woman. You used her several times.
That's sick!
Alvy, come on, for your own experience. I mean, you wanna write, why not?
Yeah. Come on. It'd be fun.
I know.
Ethics are...
It's not the air conditioner that's making me cold. Nothing moves in here. Not even your birds.
I'm cold.
I have to go, Julian.
Getting dressed. I've got to go.
You told her?
My thumbs hurt. I've made a mistake. I've been negligent. I haven't exercised. I have to hitchhike a little bit every day, no matter what. It's like a musician practicing his scales. When I don't practice, my timing gets off, my thumbs get stiff and sore.
Joel, you're a liar.
More?
Really? Rob-, that girl is sixteen.
You never said anything. About the drapes.
What are you doing?
You know the rules. You do know the rules, don't you?
Then start taking them seriously.
-- she's a very compulsive girl.
Fuckin' A --
You think so?
You're not a monster, Craig. Just a confused man.
I need a shower.
Nuh-uh, 1977! Punk Volume 1. You weren't there, so you can't understand the magic.
We have to meet.
One hour.
J.M. Inc. Be all that someone...
You cannot, Wessex will kill you
Stage fighting! Oh, Will! As Thomas Kent my heart belongs to you but as Viola the river divides us, and I will marry Wessex a week from Saturday.
Cool.
You don't live around here, do you?
Two million dollars?
What is that?
Ed, I swear, I'm not --
I wasn't gonna --
Okay. See you around.
I had a good time tonight, Miles. I really did.
You know how to get back to the Windmill, right?
Oh, yeah. Sure. Of course.
I love your script.
It certainly is...
Oh, just a old letter from a friend.
And there's no chance you had this experience simply because some part of you needed to have it?
Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any.
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else?
How's the water?
The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
I sincerely doubt it.
This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
Is this Charles?
What is it? What's happened?
Do you love me? Did you love me? Something. I listened to my tape. I can't believe I've been sitting right in front of it for a year. It's like listening to someone else's story. I mean, I hear myself talking about having sex with you and I can't even imagine you naked. I can't even say "naked" to you!
Well... I'm not gonna put you out of your bed...
...Well, I'd be okay in here--
Yes. Absolutely. You have this habit of not needing and that it's hard to break. I understand. Of course, in that case, why sleep -- you don't need rest or for that matter eat, you don't need food.
To do what? Be with someone who needs everyone and no one in particular? I mean, what would be the point. Would you pass the butter?
Well, what is this?
Well, I just want to know the procedure. I don't want to upset your routine. Do you want any jam?
Yeah?
Okay.
Copy. Yah, send me back-up!
And the soldier -- He looked at me so strangely -- who is he?
It's me.
You mean, the insurance frammis?
It can louse up your insides. You can get puh, puh, puh...
You hit a person with the oranges in the towel, they get big, awful looking bruises, but they don't really get hurt, not if you do it right. It's for working scams against insurance companies.
Better let me talk to him.
And may I go to Mass?
Well -- I said I might marry him.
Well -- I have to see Carl first.
Well, what do you think?
You would?
I found this.
No.
Well, you know where it is.
Mm-hmm. Lunch. Not even dinner.
To tell you the truth, I'd just about given up waiting.
You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
It's bad enough that you are. It's even worse that you can stand here and lie to me.
Why did you lie to me?
This isn't a courtroom. Don't try to turn this around on me.
We still have you and I.
Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong.
Oui.
Okay! Damn!
I knew this would happen! You're like a lost puppy!
Please don't follow me. Don't do it!
Oh. Okay. Well, so long. Enjoy your visit.
No.
They got... a sign on him says he was a killer.
In front of Greely's. It says, "This here is what happens to..."
Unless I get that hair-color-naming job.
About where you an' him was... an' where you was from... an' what your names was... an'...
L-lies... at first. About how you was just passin' through and didn't kill nobody... an' Little Bill kept askin' questions, mixin' him up, catchin' lies... an' then he'd beat on Ned an' Ned would cry and lie some more an' then... then...
A cowboy come in sayin' you killed Quick Mike in the shit house at the Bar T...
Lizt was my parents' favorite, they were Hungarian.
Oh, well, I don't wear a lot of jewelry.
Let's just say I...eh...I'm involved.
Well I'm sort of involved.
Where he can't get it?
It's Sebastian. He's out of his mind.
With the whole world crumbling, we pick this time to fall in love.
Oh yeah. He's a sweet man. I wanna have a big church wedding, Ma. And a reception.
Good. When you love them they drive you crazy cause they know they can. But you like him?
Ahem.
Who's dead?
Truman, I think I'm going to throw up.
You blaming me for the traffic?
I'm not positive... but... he knows.
Because I took some sleeping pills. But I'm all right now -- so let's go.
Mmm, what?
No... no.
Why did you change your mind about bringing us along?
You're calling Lydia in my office. You must think I'm some dope. You fuckin' bastard... You... ... stay out all night long...
As much as God loves you.
Take a top coat.
Hello!
Good. I want to talk to you.
Victor, tell me why! Trust me!
Does this have something to do with that man you saw?
It is
I got a delivery around here. Name of Tucker.
I am funny. I'm real funny.
What?
Have you been heating the house? Not just with the stove.
Sooner is better than later!
What happened? Who gave the order to attack?
Were the men confessed? Where are the priests?
What night?
Dick...
Dick, I can't even breathe here...
Where are the bond certificates for the First Ladies?
Is that the decoder?
My real father was an actor. He died when I was a little girl.
"The mill grinds the grain, but the grain is not destroyed. Although it is altered..."
What?
But I really should get home.
Sounds nice ... Once you get used to it.
I need to lie down for a bit.
Of course.
Yes.
Yes, Will, I do. And don't presume things you don't know.
Would you say you understand Josephine?
Bully for you.
Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
"Life is crushing in on me."
Where what was.
I can't have them any more.
Would you like some?
No.
No questions.
Does it bother you?
Why do you smoke?
I've stopped menstruating
Goodbye.
What sort of plan?
Tell, tell, tell me again.
No gentleman caller, Doc. Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening.
Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park.
It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. Then I did my laundry... watched 20 20.
I paid the money.
Thank you.
The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells...
We are almost out of water.
I thought we had a deal about you watching CNBC in bed.
Yes.
Jack. I said the kids are asleep...
Yes!
...peanuts.
Oh, it doesn't, huh! You got your little 250 dollars a week plus tips...
You are too crude.
Against anything. Just protest.
Why the hell are we delivering them out here? I can't even find any warrants in the system for these four.
Jill, I'm just trying to be helpful.
Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money.
It's this double-standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment. It's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.
I can't afford civility, sir. How am I supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider? Even if I make it under these rules, I still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file -- "Yeah, she made it, but..." I mean, really -- why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?
Pardon?
I think you've resented me from the start, sir.
No, sir.
When did he lapse into the coma?
What the hell happened, Ray?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ray--
I... I mean what're you talking about, Ray? I haven't done anything funny.
If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
Thanks. What's the matter with you?
Jah...
What're you looking for?
Whoever she is, she doesn't give up, does she?
-- it'll help me if you'll tell me.
Epps!
Why not?
Yeah, a bird in a gilded cage.
Lied? What do you mean?
Near as I can figure must be about a hundred-thousand.
He's gone, hasn't he?
Not if you see them for what they are, Duff.
Oh God. Oh God.
Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes.
Mr Brown.
Look at my face. It's the face of the people who did that. My father hardly speaks English. We're in bad trouble, you have to see that.
Thank you for going along with me. I just didn't want to explain anything... I'll send you a check.
Oh... thank you.
...Just a minute...
Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated.
Damn right.
...Mike Yanagita!
...Well, yah. Who's this?
Then say it.
What man had access to her?
Oh, in the garage. Walk me over.
Nothing.
No.
A girl can never wear enough eye shadow.
That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
What is it honey... the frenchy?
You know, Linda. I've finally figured it out. It's not sex I want. Anyone can have sex.
Nothing about him, unless he's got a problem about me dealing with you.
Don't, Duff.
How do you know?
But I'm scared Telly.
Not good.
Clay Phillips.
Stop it --
Pa! Shh!
Ok. Maybe I'll see you later. Thank you for your help.
Maybe I'll see you later, when I pick up my car?
I think I will pass...
We just having our first date when you showed up.
And I would like to see a priest.
I would like some fresh straw.
Act like one then. Be a man.
You're to the curb. You better step off. Get a life.
The DMZ?
I--I was wondering--is there anything you shouldn't eat--because of jungle fever?
Is he coming back here?
What tickets?
Where's Bruce?
Where's Butch?
I'm Cynthia Bishop.
How about inviting me over to dinner?
Get out! Me too! What are the odds?
Yeah, I know what you mean.
Just, you know, to chat a little, maybe. I have a long trip ahead of me. How far are you going? On the train, I mean, of course.
No, I don't want to bug you if you're trying to --
Oh. So...
It's okay if I sit closer? So I don't have to scream. Not that I don't need to scream sometimes, believe me. But I don't want to bug you if you're trying to write or something.
Look, here's some of that chicken with salsa too, I warmed it up -- 74.
That's your favorite, too? Tried to slip it by me, eh?
Hurry up! I'm freezing!
I heard.
And fifty other lines to get into a girl's pants.
You know, if you ever got me, you wouldn't have a clue what to do with me. That's the thing, Romeo.
She's very beautiful.
I went out last night.
Should we?
FLEA! KEEP YOUR EYES ON THAT SPOT! Mark it, mark it! Cortez? What the hell you waiting for?
Flea, 'Cool, Cortez, Newman -- take your minis, hit the water. Go, GO!
I said: I DON'T KNOW. You can't just come in here and start pokin' around --
I can try my father's safe. I'm sure I can get the keys to his office.
That's great! We'll have the fare in no time!
They'll blame the bloody housekeeper. She nicks stuff all the times!
This lot's got to be worth 50 quid!
I know, I'll lean forward and show more cleavage!
What do you think?
Zip me up?
Where's your dad?
What are you doing here?
Where to?
Your dad's really gonna build his house?
Do you think she's invited you up for her sake or for mine?
No, no, shut up! I've had enough. I tried, Tyler... I have tried...
You making a feature?
Sure. Like in Mikey and Niki. Did you see that picture?
It's your money. You talk.
Too bad. I wasn't in it.
Do I know you? Weren't you on the set the other night? With Ramada.
They couldn't be worse for the Buttles.
Why don't you say, no system is perfect.
How many terrorists have you met? Actual terrorists?
Who is this war against, Sam?
Look at that - right on time.
What you did changed my life.
You are an insane person.
Their sound is quite musical.
It's hard to describe.
What?
Aw c'mon, this is a fun party.
Whatever. I'll take my food to go...
Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.
Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me?
She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street.
Like old times. Same booth, same song --
Prove it.
Don't be scared, Walter.
You're such an asshole.
Let us talk plainly. You invade England. But you cannot complete the conquest, so far from your shelter and supply. The King proposes that you withdraw your attack. In return he grants you title, estates, and this chest with a thousand pounds of gold, which I am to pay to you personally.
I totally, totally hate you.
Oh my god, I remember this hat... this was during your little old lady phase...
Fuck it. Everything must go!
This is it? I can't believe you're selling some of this stuff.
Leave her alone! You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard.
Oh yeah right, like I'm gonna let some asshole with a goatee own Goofy Gus.
What was that all about? I thought everything must go!
Packs an emotional wallop.
Brilliantly moving.
A flat-out hit.
Yes.
I'll give you something you've been jerking off about ever since our parents got married.
Because I'm the only person you can't control and it kills you.
You can put it anywhere.
It would feel so yummy.
It's a beautiful home you have here Mrs. Rosemond.
I didn't stutter. Take care of your responsibilities. Y'know exactly what I'm talking about.
I just don't want you to lose the one job you've been able to keep, that's all. I'm carrying you as it is.
Yeah, then ya should take better care of your responsibilities.
Come on, John. You should be happy, we've gone this far without Ann finding out, I'm making it real easy on you. Just walk out of here and I'll see you at your house for a family dinner sometime.
He'a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box office. Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
How about straightening up the living room?
Oh, please. Come on, John. You're fucking your wife's sister and you hardly been married a year. You're a liar. But at least I know you're a liar. It's the people that don't know, like Ann, that have to watch out.
I see "Hot Cross Buns," but okay.
--But you can do my O-chem lab in under an hour, you can--
It's about a dimwitted editor who --
I'll just strap it on the roof.
No, just a friend of mine. I don't think he Likes Jell O.
What? What is it?
You live in the neighborhood?
Who told you that?
When Mother died Pop sent me out to school in the country. He was afraid with no one home I'd get into bad company.
Just follow me.
Cute. Let's have some drinks.
Careful, it's slippery. I had it waxed.
Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut factory? Six scoop interviews!
We've certainly been in some swell jams.
In a way.
We sure did, but we had to go in hiding for a week.
You're on the grift. Same as me.
Roy, you're a short-con operator. And a good one, I think. Don't talk to me like I'm another square.
I watched you. Working the tap on those soldier boys.
The tap. What you do for a living.
Oh, come on, Roy.
The long end. Big con.
No, those are socials you're thinking of... Saturday's usually.
Oh.
That is not what I'm --
Yes...
Oh.
Does it bother you?
You ever think about killing another human being?
You don't have to kill it.
You're horrible
What is he saying? Come on, what did he say?
Sounds perfectly clear. Where does the Ostrich come in?
What if it takes 20 minutes, Norman? What if it takes an hour? And he can fight it off? We can't afford that.
It's an idea.
What?
Benjamin?
Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
Say, this is Snugsville.
I don't know you at all. BUD Permit me -- C.C. Baxter -- junior executive, Arthur Murray graduate, lover.
All right...
First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you.
Yes, we've got a 4:30 train to catch. Why?
Yeah, for about a month now. Lenny, just stay away from Tran, okay? And stay away from me. Stop trying to rescue me. Those days are over. I'm a big girl now. Stop trying to save me, okay, because I don't need saving... Just... give up on me.
You have to get out of here. If Tran catches you he'll... he's acting crazy. He's doing way too much playback and he's getting completely paranoid. He's such a control freak, he's even paying Max to follow me around.
Damn right.
Maybe.
...she's having a bath now... why do you want to see her?
You know one of the ways movies still have Squid beat? Because they always say "The End." You always know when it's over. It's over! Now please leave. I have to go on again in a couple of minutes.
All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you?
Are you?
No, that's fine. She'll tell everybody, but that's fine.
Oh. Hi. Sorry.
I promise. I will never let go, Jack. I'll never let go.
Well, I guess so. You're the guy I work for.
Frank said ---
I see.
Oh.
I wouldn't know.
We've made a lot of pictures together.
Who else ?
I hate that word. It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen.
Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man. She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils. He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips.
They will love it every place. Read it. Read the scene just before she has him killed!
Why, did you tell Corey what happened?
Your father practically owns the company. You can do anything you like, silly.
Marzipan. Pink tents. Hundreds, thousands of roses. Photographers. Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz. And we'll hire someone to videotape. Patrick, we should do it.
Get married. Have a wedding.
Come on, Alvy, they're only baby ones, for God's sake.
Stop it, Bill!
Three fifteen.
You have Corey and DC. I have my dad.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
These can be such trying situations everyone seems to make such a to-do over a simple little accident. Of course, they can be very frightening, and I must apologize for David, he's never had an accident before.
I hope you're comfortable.
But you must have something to go on?
Then maybe you can read mine.
And the bad news?
Arrest me.
I am calm!
Or anywhere where people might see us.
Tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago? The music sounds kind of the same from where I'm sitting.
He said... take his right arm.
You're breaking up... I can't hear you.
What!!?
Yeah. What?
Yeah...but you're not dying!
Mickey, you're off the hook. You should be celebrating.
You're just realizing this now?
Can I -- go out?
What's the time frame?
Oh, but you must not mind my talking about you! In fact, William says my main job here at Belvoir is to civilize you; to make an honest English gentleman out of you.
So, you are William's wild young neighbor? Or should I say, 'brother'; William claims you as a member of his family. I have heard so many unflattering tales about you, and I understand, that except for you, this 'family' is quite cultivated.
Philadelphia. Then he didn't do it, did he, Nick?
They musta been beefin' big time with one another, cuz this shit, got way past words, whatever it was.
...What are they doin' right now...?
...Shhhhhhit... girl, there's these two dudes, just sittin' here in this elevator, all shot up...
What?
I'm not givin' it up jus' yet...
I'll get you some coffee.
No. Not something new.
I never like to talk about my work.
Thanks.
Nothing's wrong. It's great, okay? Having the time of my life. Mac's a fantastic director. And what can anyone say about Cal that hasn't been said. And it's great working with friends, blah blah blah.
Oh you know. No doubts. No second thoughts. Am I a monster?
Are you jealous? I thought you said you didn't care what he did.
Yeah, well, Bleek trusted me. We're best friends.
I wouldn't be so sure about that. He did it with you. He's a man now.
There's no way in hell they're having sex or even holding hands.
Are you honestly and truly going to prom with Katrina De Voort?
Prom is for wenises, anyway. Once you're old enough to go, it's not cool anymore.
Okay Juno, I'm really convinced.
I never got to know him, really. I couldn't speak Japanese, and his English was terrible. But I couldn't say anything, because his English was better than my Japanese.
You picked the unrequited variety. Very bad for the skin.
What can I do for you?
Do you have any idea what its like to have two people look at you with total lust and devotion through the same pair of eyes? No I don't suppose you would. It's quite a thrill, Craig.
No, no, I'm fine.
Hi.
What?
I know. It's not like it makes all your problems go away.
Don't Louis --
I'll put you in your coffin. Forever.
What, like a girdle?
Yeah, well, you're not the only one. Everybody I know has totally fucked up problems... It seems like only stupid people have good relationships...
I mean, I'm eighteen years old and I've never even had a real, steady boyfriend for more than like two weeks!
Never...
Uh huh.
This convent is locked solid. The only one that has a key is Sister Marguerite and she wouldn't let Christ in after dark.
Well, it's been known to happen in the day too. Maybe Agnes went to him.
Oh come on, you've talked to her. She doesn't even know how babies are born, let alone made.
Sister Anne, which was Agnes' room?
The one up on the third floor?
When did you first learn about her... innocence, the way she thinks?
Shortly after she came to us.
I have committed no sin.
That is idle talk.
I have done nothing against the ordnung.
I am not a child.
You have decided to leave, Moncho.
If they've sent that little shmuck Baum again, I'm gonna be real pissed off.
Nothing of the kind. Karen and I had a nice talk.
Just some coffee.
Oddly enough - she didn't say a word about Margo. Just that she'll be happy to do what she can to see that I play the part.
I discussed it very openly. I told her that I had spoken to Lloyd - and that he was interested.
Just like that.
Because faith is rewarded.
No. I'm just depressed.
Don't worry. It's a test.
No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
Way past it.
Does that have a hidden meaning?
You were standing in the middle of the street?
I love that dream.
You know that dream where you're walking down the street naked and everyone is looking at you?
But he saw you, right?
That was nothing compared to this humiliation, nothing.
He said hello.
What, I couldn't hear you?
Go to the bathroom.
You're not from Alaska! Where'd you learn to dance like that?! And there are no starving people, are there?!
Don't change the subject! I want you to tell me the truth about yourself.
If you were tore up I would not be claiming you. Trust.
I told him about your car.
This guy's dangerous, let's think of something else.
You found Patchett. You found me. You're smart enough. Be a detective if that's what you want.
Very persuasive.
Don't sulk. What brought all this on?
No. Probably not.
Well forgive me if I don't think of you as the world's safest bet.
No. I don't think so. I'm just curious about how one goes from making tapes for one person to marriage proposals to another in two days. Fair enough?
Because I'm a newspaper woman, Heaven help me!
All right. Heads I go -- tails I stay to write the story. Ready?
Don't touch me! I'm not doing it for you!
What's the difference? I'm going to write that story -- and you know it!
Wood Productions. The mark of quality.
Of course I'm here. Today is the file clerk's big scene.
Oh really? How much money did he put up?
I see the usual gang of misfits and dope addicts are here. Say, who's the lug?
She could have hurt me if she wanted to.
You don't know that. If it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. Somehow you have to break the connection.
Ed, you've got to snap out of this. Bela's dead -- you're not!
Well you tried --
This is the right day.
And Paul D...you don't have to stay 'way, but be careful how you talk to my mama, hear?
Thank you.
Yes sir
I don't. I have my own.
That's Ed.
I know it is, Brad -
I know a thing or two about marriage. You... you understand me more than anyone, Harry... maybe even more than Mama. But... you're too important to me. I'd fail you. I don't know how or why, but I would. And that's a chance I just can't take. Do you understand?
There's nothing else here.
He couldn't stop us and that's how he was punished. Peter, what time were you born?
No, Benjamin. I don't hate him. Unhook my blouse.
Is it?
On New Year's Eve. Sometimes on his birthday.
Not exactly.
We've talked enough, Benjamin.
I'm not eating alone. Can I ask you a question?
Older.
They wouldn't?
So you ever gonna do a picture?
You're just scared.
It's gonna be fine, Orson. You're gonna do great.
Please, Jacqueline.
What do you want to talk about instead? Your day? That's a fascinating subject.
I'm really afraid.
That guy knows you?
I can't believe you let them do this!
I was, but I managed to bum a ride on the last flight out here. Only here isn't where I left it, is it, Bud?
We were that close to proving a submersible drilling platform could work. We had over seven thousand feet of hole down for Chrissake. I can't believe you let them grab my rig!
My rig. I designed the damn thing.
You wimp. I had a lot riding on this. They bought you... more like least rented you cheap--
Ryan's really angry with me.
What am I, five?
I'm a little in the puke zone.
Lemon.
Okay.
No.
Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose.
We did no impact evaluation. The consequences of...
You know what I mean...
Please.
I'm sorry, I can't help it. It's too funny.
You just said very food.
You're lucky. She couldn't come anyway --
Fuck me, Mr. McAllister
Will it change my life?
She said, your name was Alvy Singer.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, you. Because in the dream... I break Sinatra's glasses.
Oh, and God, Alvy, I did... this really terrible thing to him. Because then when he sang it was in this real high-pitched voice.
Well, she said that I should probably come five times a week. And you know something? I don't think I mind analysis at all. The only question is, will it change my wife?
It doesn't matter to them.
Shhh!
Oh yeah, like he even noticed.
I'll be back.
How long will you be?
Not long.
Or what you see in me, for that matter...
Well, I've felt that way, hadn't you?
Buddy, I'm worried about Rose.
You took this picture?
"Rise, one need not bend the knee before the throne of justice."
They're all preparing for the auditions - your movie.
What are you doing down there?
...lost the screw...
No it is not!
Hold still.
I have no idea how to spit this out.
Prove it.
Mars doesn't rise until 2:30
You planned this --
Are you trying to seduce me?
"Take-back?" What is that? I don't want a take-back. I want you to come to California with me.
I thought I would ask you a few questions if that's okay.
Well, I used to go to the Dodger on your nights, and I saw you're doing it again and that your putting out a record, and it's sort of a then-and- now story against the backdrop of the Chicago music scene with the emphasis on now.
Thank you, Harry.
I'm Caroline Fortis from The Reader. I want to do a story on you.
I'm looking for Deejay Rob Gordon.
What's wrong?
Yes, this is not life, Will. This is a stolen season.
Very smooth. It's Palmer, right? Where I came from a palmer was a person who cheated at cards. Really though... the Bible describes a God who watches over one tiny world a few thousand years old. I look out there and see a universe of hundreds of billions of galaxies, each with hundreds of billions of stars... I mean burn me for a heretic, but your God seems awfully small.
Well it's been a while, but I don't recall the Bible saying too much about alien civilizations.
Irena. But who are you?
Who are you?
Some day I'm afraid we're going to have to tell her about Irena.
Amy picked it off the top of that stack. Perhaps you'd better go through the whole bunch. There may be others of Irena in there.
He might be weird -- he can talk more freely if I go alone -- why's that so hard to understand?
I've wanted a friend.
I'm your friend.
Thank you... thank you very much.
Betty Elms.
Yes, Sir.
Good-by, Tommy.
Good-by, Tom. Later--when it's blowed over--you'll come back? You'll try to fin' us?
I'll get Rosasharn.
Disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.
Don't be so sure.
Think carefully?
We're supposed to be honest.
Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince.
Free?
Sure, it's a meal ticket for me. I admit it, but it's also a windfall for somebody like Mr. Norton who's trying to crash national politics. That's what you bought the newspaper for, isn't it? You wanta reach a lotta people, don't you? Well, put John Doe on the air and you can reach a hundred and fifty million of 'em. He can say anything he wants and they'll listen to him.
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much of a dumb cluck as he is! Excuse me.
I love it when pistolero's talk of trust.
Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. -- What's that?
... How long have I been out?
What is this stuff? Kevlar?
My hero. Let's go.
What's C.R.S.?
I'll wait.
Hey, you're still here. I suppose you like it here with us.
Oh, yeah?
You mean the one who --
What?
Oh my God --
You were saying you don't want a million dollars.
Instant celebrity is overwhelming to anybody. You've known John Bubber all your life, you're used to him, you know you're the same human being you were before all the excitement. So you feel like a fraud...
Yeah, he has to go to work in a little while. I do too.
Yes, sir.
No, c'mon --
He was in the bank yesterday.
Why are you doing this?
Just put me down as a avg -- a vagrant vagabond. Come on, this is a joke! Assault and battery? I barely touched that bitch!
Fifteen.
I don't believe this! You jerks drag me down here in the middle of the night and you don't even know who the hell I am!
Old fool!
Probably not, but I still don't have the nerve to tell him.
How was your plane ride?
Portchnik.
Hi.
Good.
You were the only Sullivan in the phone book.
This is your house, right?
What's happening to us?
You said he was dead.
Nothing - if she dosen't love me -
The personal note is all there is to it. It's all there ever is to it. It's all there every is to anything! Stupidity in our government, complacency and self-satisfaction and unwillingness to believe that anything done by a certain class of people can be wrong - you can't fight those things impersonally. They're not impersonal crimes against people. They're being done by actual persons - with actual names and positions and - the right of the American people to own their own country is not an academic issue, Brad, that you debate - and then the judges retire to return a verdict and the winners give a dinner for the losers.
Are you finished?
You're not going to like it in Chicago. They wind comes howling in from the lake. And there's practically no opera season at all - and the Lord only knows whether they've ever heard of Lobster Newburg -
You hang out with me because nobody else can stand to be around you.
Is it drug related?
Can we go up to the crime scene?
Ben! Mommy's so glad to see you -- Now stop climbing! Ben listen to me...
I think she went to bed I saw her going toward the house
Oh, Rob. What do you want me to say?
I told you I slept with him.
Is that why you wanted to see me?
So, how are you?
So how would you put it?
Why did you betray me? Paris was ours for the taking! All I needed was another few hundred men... Why did you take back the army you gave me?
Peace will only be got from the English at the end of a lance!
Yes. You're much too old to making a drama out of alienation, or whatever you call it. You've got to take responsibility for your own happiness. That's what I think anyway.
I think you're exaggerating. And if you aren't, you should jolly well change your job.
What's wrong with that? The FBI was very understanding when I explained it to him. Everybody knows it isn't you ... It's the pressures from your home life.
Oh my God! I don't understand. If you needed money, why couldn't you come to me? Everything I got is yours. I got two hundred and maybe twenty-five in the savings. It's yours. You know it.
He was very understanding - you ought to talk to him ... Algeria?
I said you were never a faggot.
Well, I'm only trying to get you outta this. I told them you were in Vietnam, you always had good jobs, you were with Goldwater at the '64 convention, but you had marital problems...
I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car!
Ryan, you've got to come! You've got to help me find the dog! I let their dog out. We need to find the dog.
How much is this?
A what?
Who cares? Who cares?
We're not having an affair. He's married. He just happens to think I'm neat.
Oh, well, now we're finally getting to a subject you know something about!
"Existential Motifs in Russian Literature"! You're really close.
But if the other fellow is quicker and fires first...
But... if he doesn't miss?
Once... long ago... in the folly of youth... he made me love him.
I am eternally in your debt.
Doctor... Can I impart to you his cruelest trick?
Right now, you're doing nothing?
What are you doing?
Are you going to the party tonight?
What are you doing?
What time are you gonna be there?
No. Just the coffee.
I have some, but I have to find out where they are staying.
I don't have one.
They left.
Hi.
What I love.
Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song.
What does it look like?
You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more.
You mean the time you're locked away?
Yes! I want to know.
You're insane.
Can I take your coats?
Oh no. Thank you. Come on in.
Hello. Thank you for having me and my irresponsible child over to your home.
Vanessa, right?
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff. I'm Vanessa.
Oh Mac, no! He's a sweet kid. You know it wasn't his idea.
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this. And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.
Oh God yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.
Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention.
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy. Not like those other people with the fake woods in the background. Like I'm really going to fall for that, you know?
Sure.
Doll, you and Waski run on, too.
Fust thing I'll get is coffee, cause ever'body been wantin' that, an' then some flour an' bakin' powder an' meat. Better not get no side- meat right off. Save that for later. Maybe Sat'dy. Got to get some soap too. An' milk. Rosasharn's got to have some milk.
No, no, I see...
I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better.
Yes.
What should I do?
Just take his order, look him in the eye and if he says anything remotely funny, laugh a lot.
I know, everyone says that.
What can I get for you tonight.
I don't know. Few days. Thanks for helping me. I appreciate it.
And I miss you.
Hunh-uh. Not yet. Look, don't take any of 'em on your bike, okay? Call a cab if you wanna go somewhere.
We're upstairs, George. Now come on. Behave yourself, and for Christ's sake, do me a favor. Don't let me drink too much.
Seven of clubs. Nobody's mad we just want to talk about it.
FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!!
It happens.
Nothing a good stiff drink can't fix.
It's always John.
It's not going to happen.
Suzette -- I told you not to bring the pearls. I will not wear them tonight.
...I heard he said... That's all... Thanks.
Everything! Prison -- humiliation -- being abandoned and betrayed by everyone -- I can't stand it anymore -- I'd rather die!
Get out of the way.
I don't know, Kyle. You're the fucking expert. Now get out of the way!
Hmm?
Yes, Tom -- I think I can manage.
See? You're laughing again. But That's what I want. Go places and Move and never look back and just Have fun. Forever. That's my idea Of heaven. Need someone to share It with, though.
Jane, yes. Tom? Tom, is that you? Is this Tom?
Just doesn't, that's all.
Drink?
Benjamin -- I'm sorry to be this way, but I don't want to be alone in this house.
What do you drink?
Please wait till my husband gets home.
I don't know.
It's finished. I won.
I want to know everything about you.
You always did.
Joe, I thought I was gonna be all right by now, I just need a little more --
I don't know --
That counts.
Trust me, Claire. You hear something... change the subject. You find something... get rid of it, throw it in the lake. You know what happened. The rest is only details. And no one's ever glad they got a hold of those. If you want to put this back together...just let it go.
Nothing.
I guess not.
You're pressuring yourself...
He's trying to put it behind him, Claire. You should too.
You don't have to do that.
-- which is --
He has -- something. A funny little quality I find --
I was in the fish-market play. What happened to him?
Oh, God, that would be something I really want to do.
... A hundred and eight?
Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
American literature. What else?
So?
What?
What?
HEY YOU!!!! I'm gonna get you!!! I'll get you!!!!
Promise?
Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now.
No, Lester.
That's the subject of my last chapter.
I mean, I'm not... I wasn't absolutely sure if... they --
What? Why...
Nobody said... Norman... What? Why are you looking at me like that?
What?... Wait. Don't... why are you --
MOVE!
Bill...
Don't get stuck on some glamour puss-
You're not such a bargain, you know, conceited and thoughtless and messy-
- you're a setup for some gorgeous wide-eyed young babe.
I don't want to be childish, I'd settle for just a few years-
All right, fire-and-evade maneuvers. Drop everything but weapons and the PRC radio -- we're gonna be high speed, low drag all the way to the link-up site. Ready?
Daddy and I tried hard. We really did.
You don't have a brain tumor. He didn't say you had a brain tumor. MICKEY No, naturally they're not gonna tell you, because, well, you know, th--, sometimes the weaker ones will panic if you tell 'em.
Why?
Thanks. What are you doing?
So how's it going?
Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend.
...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man.
Yes.
What is this?
What?
Just one minute...
Why, you... you little bastard!
She's got to identify him.
Honey. You got him.
I'd identify him.
Because the the only way to stop crime is to identify criminals. I can't believe you're talking this way Mister Detective -- I think she's got a lot of guts.
You're sure? Any more nightmares?
Oh I can see you've had a bad day. We'll see the house another time, okay?
And he might blame you for terrifying him. That one moment could erase all you've accomplished. And if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.
I'd be there for him.
We know each other.
Hey --
Can't.
Where? At the City Hall? No! I want the whole wedding or we will have Bad Luck. For a whole wedding to be planned, a date must be set.
Thank you? Dick, sometimes I understand why they hate you.
But listen, if I had a friend in the same position, I would tell her to delay a year.
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
There's been an accident, Truman.
But here's the thing. I retraced your exact steps according to your statement. You couldn't have seen Detective Eckhart from there. I mean, not in that fog.
I don't care about that girl, I don't care if she's dead.
No.
It is. We know that. And it's enough that we know. Just think of the girls. They're still young. We never see them. I lost my parents. I don't want them to lose theirs; I don't want them to grow up without a mother and father ...
The girl's name was Doreen. That's all I know.
You know I didn't mind. And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.
Fix it up. It'll make you feel better.
Ray. I hate Ian.
You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at. But I already knew you could make me laugh. It's everything else I don't know about.
If God wants me to win, he will find a way. And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too. Then I'll be with him forever.
I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
It would not be the same without you.
I don't know how you know about Eugene, but these ideas are part of your delusions.
How do you know about Eugene?
Just one. Some lady called. Said she's a little hot-headed sometimes... But she still wants her occasional roommate. She'd like to talk it over after she gets off work tonight... if it's humanly possible....
That... and you.
No, I don't think you do. And besides... I haven't decided yet.
I can't be.
Who's that sitting in your car?
Go ahead -- what?
God Almighty -- Whew. Do I mind? Why do I mind? I do mind. What a shock -- I don't have a right to... I don't think I like him. I know I don't respect him...So what am I talking about -- what am I saying to you?
He tore his ACL.
The doctor'll be back in a minute.
Not great.
Why did you quit?
I beg your pardon?
You were talking about your wedding.
I like your stories.
I'm just offering a place to stay.
And you're the guy who's going to open it.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
You heard the shower, didn't you?
Mum was terrified for me. She didn't approve of my lifestyle one bit.
Sandro, I don't want you to come with me, I don't want to see you... How can I make it clear to you?...Why did you come?
It's Choco. And he's not my boyfriend. He's a bounty hunter.
Have you read it?... They're asking for anyone with information to get in touch with them.
Yes, you should go.
Ooooh!
Promise not to tell Doll? -- or nobody? Buddy, it's your Daddy! I'm so much in love with him I am out of my mind!
There's nothing to it.
Well I never did it.
What do you mean 'better in bed.' You either do it or you don't.
Yeah but they look more sophisticated. You'd probably think they'd be better in bed.
Oh, give me a break, Stacy. You're much prettier than them.
Do you think guys find that attractive?
I fell madly in love with him when he called me Rosebud. You know that first day when I come and he said I looked graceful like a capital letter S and called me Rosebud? I fell madly in love with that man right then. But it's a lost love, Buddy. He's a good man and won't have nothin' to do with me.
I don't think you're going to do that.
I know. But you've never met. It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.
At Paul and Miranda's. Paul from work.
Wanna go to dinner?
Hi. What are you doing?
What were you like when you were younger?
But you don't mind.
Why do you say that?
I bet you could do a book.
I just wondered. Why were you trouble?
Don't be mad at him -- He just wants to help.
These are nothing. You can have anything you want if you'll only stay. What is it you want -- money?
What are you doing, Joe? What are you doing? You're not leaving me?
No, you're not. Max! Max!
You'd think he'd do it for Elaine's sake, at least...
He certainly could. About a month.
Clay could save us an awful lot of time.
No we don't. But that's where we're going. From Minden we take a stage to Reno, then another one over to Auburn and another one to Placerville. Then it's a day's trip to Sonora.
We don't want to go there.
Maybe I better start working on him.
How many ways can a man say no.
You're not giving up?
What are you waiting for? Do something.
Thank you?
But you use potato?
What would you have me say, David?
My dear Horowitz. In the first place, I'm paying you union scale. Second, it's my piano. Third, if everybody doesn't like kind of dying on the vine, they can get off the vine and go home. "Liebestraum."
"Liebestraum."
I like--really need a cigarette, too.
It hasn't been laid out, we haven't finished with the embalming. As a matter of fact, you're looking at it. The remains of Margo Channing. Sitting up. It is my last wish to be buried sitting up.
If my guests do not like it here, I suggest they accompany you to the nursery where I'm sure you will all feel more at home.
Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't.
I used to hate it. Now I like it.
You can't tell this story. He's not kidding you. You can't tell this story. You knew that. The pay off was, you get to be Ambassador, or...
I'll probably marry him.
I liked it better when there were just the two of us.
My mother always told me I would summon my husband by playing the piano.
I don't think so.
He wants us to move out, says there could be fifty more mines in the building. He thinks I'm mad because I laughed at him. He's Indian, he wears a turban.
With his Sergeant. A Mr. Hardy.
Of course I will.
You said that already.
We'll talk in the morning.
I don't want anything you don't wanna give me.
I think this place is just fine.
Do it!
Yes..
Tell me, Mr Driscoll - is it a requirement of the forestry business that you have to be as thick as the trees you cut down?
Anderton, leave.
Look, you need Ich. I've been here five years and I still can't read all the street signs.
An outside person. A foreigner. A barbarian. You, me. More you.
Dead gaiijin's are big news.
You have a helluva way of asking for help.
I don't give tours.
I don't get it.
It was an accident.
I said I was sorry...
I'm supposed to speak at their tenth anniversary.
My father founded a music school there. The Milton Gregory School.
You live in Manhattan?
Are you nervous?
Where's the old highway?
Yes.
And I appreciate you, too.
You have an awfully nice habit, Sam.
Whenever I start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that God-looks- out-for-everybody look and... I feel better.
Patience doesn't run in our family. Sam, I'm going out there!
IT DESTROYED THE ELECTORAL PROCESS.
Where you been keeping yourself? I told John must be cold if Stamp stay inside.
Out where?
What you want there? Somebody invite you in?
Chuck.
Chuck, forget the Xerox. So Russia didn't turn out well?
Yeah, tell me. Tell me all of it.
Yeah.
Yes. Hold this pigeon.
Sir. If tomorrow... I was not under your command... would the inquiry still go forward?
Would you have the discretion to end it right then and there?
I'm saying, we're just friends.
Yes, darling,
Sir, please... if there's any way to do this without dragging everyone through the mud...
But why Egypt?
Oh, why are you making those faces?
Look, can't you feel the energy? It's tangible energy! The room's alive with positive vibrations!
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.
I kind of said that maybe they could do something. Help. I'm sorry. They really wanted to come. I really wanted to come and they wanted to be with me. I don't think they'll be too much trouble.
Or wound. Let them keep their eyes and fingers.
Where's Sam?
Do you need help?
George is great but I know what you mean.
Don't treat me like I'm stupid. It pisses me off.
Face it, you can go around with cute guys and get hung up on their sexy bodies and things like that but sooner or later you've got to find somebody. Face it, time isn't on your side.
I guess not.
But if it got late and I hadn't shown up?
Are they my kind Louis? Dolls never change either.
You loved him.
Well... thanks, anyway.
Well, that's a relief. Thank you.
I'm still in L.A., but I'm looking for Tod. I heard he was around.
Was he with a girl?
What do you care about?
You remember me. Louise? Rhymes with squeeze.
I wish I could return the favor.
Thanks.
Come here.
What do you want?
He won't.
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.
The hell you know about me?! You got no right to talk to me about that shit! The hell you think you are?
I won't let anyone hurt you.
Again!
That's enough.
Southern light.
You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
You plan to drink both those beers?
Yeah?
Oh, uh, I don't know. I miss you. Tsch.
Oh, yeah. Oh. Oh! Alvy?
Was there somebody in your room when I called you?
I mean was there another- I thought I heard a voice.
I like you in a black tie.
It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
Okay... okay... I put it down. Now open that door. Mister Fisher's right on the other side of that door. He's an actor...
ok.
I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
It's not the gun. Don't you understand... It's you. What you stand for. That is not for Samuel.
You couldn't ?
What?
It's just...it seems like you're always yelling at me.
I thought Sidra's ankle was okay for next game.
Yeah. And right now there's some fat guy over there watching us.
No... Donnie, wait. I've never...
The son of one of his colleagues. Don't act that way. We'll talk about it later. Wait for me Thursday at the Cinema Paradiso. I'll be coming with the five o'clock bus.
No, Salvatore. You'd better go. It's my father.
He won't be convinced, Salvatore. He has other plans for me.
I care! And I care because God cares! All life is precious to God -- even his -- even yours and mine...
Did it hurt?
Yes.
Why should they?
I don't know.
Would you like to talk about it?
I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
How were you sick?
Something I ate.
Do you remember the night they said it came?
No. I was sick.
Calm down, Daddy, you'll see, you're going to love it.
I'm Allison, you're 'honey'.
Drew called from the AStar, they're still two minutes away.
No.
If you kill him, you kill me!
YOU'RE SORRY!!
What's the BITCH'S name?!
You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is.
What... is... happening... ?
You've been fucking somebody else haven't you?
Tim, go throw up somewhere.
No.
...Well, that passed.
Okay. Wait here a second. Do we really want to do this?
We're American soldiers. We don't abandon people.
We can't just go off and--
You're the one wanted to kill Iraqis so bad.
The workhouse.
I do not accept.
The Queen forbids it. I cannot allow it because I cannot live without you. Without you, I cannot find the strength to be who I must be. Please.
Has someone seen to those bruises?
Yes?
Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing.
With a bag of marshmallows.
Has he been hurt?
I bet he pitches a tent in the middle of their bedroom, and they have to pretend to be on some mountain!
Her master's voice! I must go now -- goodbye -- thanks.
A number of them are dead, three are in prison, one's a waiter... Two -- you'll enjoy this -- two are actually members of the Chamber of Commerce.
Eddie, these things take time. Particularly at this hour...
I'm a professional, Eddie. Getting paid is all the thanks I require.
The one in your office? It's the best one for naps.
I think I'll go to bed.
Perfectly innocent! Man have been hanged for less! I'm lied to, attacked behind my back, accused of reading your silly dialogue inaccurately - as if it were Holy Gospel!
Not mouse, never mouse! If anything - rat!
- in this case, apparently, as trustworthy as the World Almanac!
So full of meaning, fire and music!
You married?
Then you listened as if someone else had written you play - whom did you have in mind? Sherwood? Arthur Miller? Beaumont and Fletcher?
Like everybody else--except us. Always standing on the sidewalk waving goodbye to moving trucks. Your parents ... ?
Oh, so that's it...
If...well, if we took the, if we took Fifth, then-then-then we'd get to your house first, yeah?
Well, I live downtown.
Yeah, I, we both live downtown.
Oh, gee, I don't know. Um...
Well, wait. You know what? I know.
Uh...
It depends on what way you want to go.
I went to a temple today and I didn't feel anything.
And now I am back.
What, he should see me help you catch him?
He's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. He wants a gun, give him a gun. Take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. The more manpower we've got in there, the better. He won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.
Mmm, baby. And I'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...
Sump'n got to happen soon. We got one day's more grease, two day's flour, an' ten potatoes. After that... An' Rosasharn, we got to remember she's gonna be due soon.
You keep asking me why I'm here.
You know. Your love machine... the throbbing thrill hammer... your thing!
Oh. I got your cigarettes.
I threw it away.
Oh, he's fine! I just heard from him. He's bombing all these places...
What are you going to do?
What about your friends? Or your brothers? When do I get to meet them?
Over? It's only over when you can crawl to a clean little spot on earth where the sun sometimes shines and you can warm yourself a bit.
You've never had any formal training, either?
You jump, I jump, right?
When is it finally over? I want it to be over before my baby is born.
Right now?
THINGS MY HEAR USED TO KNOW THINGS IT YEARS TO REMEMBER
I remember something lost ... I'm so confused! Oh, please, just tell me if you recognize me! Do you think I could have... belonged to you ...
I don't know! I don't want to hurt you...
Yes, Abbe?
Folks ain't talkin' about much else. They say they got posses out. Talkin' about a lynchin'--when they catch the fella.
I go to the blue'n gold barber shop in Westwood. The guy in the third chair's dynamite... nobody much.
No kidding? Your own shop?
What if I don't want it?
I wouldn't do it.
This isn't the time --
I vote for the motel.
Like pick up some booze and go to a motel?
Who cares? Mmmm. Now I remember. Mayo the Wop. Gee, I'm glad you're here. I've been looking forward to this all week.
What happens if he doesn't have his medication?
We need to talk --
Oh, my God, you found it. Thank you so much. Did you get your tape?
Oh, make it live -- please, Viktor.
Every job like this has moments where things don't go so well and everyone starts thinking about their own ass. It's in those moments that everything comes together or falls apart.
I had a partner and she fucked me.
Thank you.
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?
I won't.
I think we're going to find out.
And? NO. I don't wanna know. What do you mean "and..."?
Directing suits you.
About five thousand dollars. With my discount.
Shit. It's my Galiano.
Shit!
My God, your wardrobe is incredible. It took me forever to decide. Oh, and I found Dr. X, thank you. You saved my life.
No. Look! In the window.
I totally heard you did.
What about Katrina De Voort? You could go out with Katrina De Voort.
Were we together?
Yeah. Sure. Once Tino gets a new drumhead we should be good to go.
On the house.
Sweet.
What do you think? Custard or Cheesecake?
Your shirt and jacket are still stained with blood. I have them soaking.You can wear these.
I should tell you these do not have buttons. See? Hooks and eyes.
Yes. It's good that someone can have the use of them. Besides, in your clothes you'd stand out to strangers.
Buttons are Hochmut.
Vain. Proud. Such a person is Hochmutsnarr. He is not plain.
You make fun of me. Like the tourists. Driving by all the time. Some even come into the yard. Very rude. They seem to think we are quaint.
I don't think...
Well ... we'll leave her a note.
But it said 12.
Diane?
For what?
I remember our big plan was as soon as we got the apartment we were going to trick Daniel Dusentrieb into coming over and then fuck him.
You can count on me, sir!
Anyway, now we can start looking for the apartment... Do you remember when we first came up with that whole idea of renting our own apartment?
Wasn't it like eighth grade?
Seventh... you wanted to move out right then!
My Jewish friend's grandmother did.
Chet? To a play? Are you kidding?
And if it so happens that you're wrong? If it just so happens that I could care less About you?
Look, I've got to go. I'm gonna be late for the play.
It's unbelievable. The man never ages.
Uh-huh.
It was healed by the following morning and she started eating again...
She had a... a hole in the palm of her hand! She could have bled to death.
But she didn't... did she. If anyone had seen what I'd seen she'd be public property... newspapermen, psychiatrists, ridicule. She doesn't deserve that.
She has it now.
I know what you're thinking, she's a hysteric pure and simple.
I saw it. Clean through the palm of her hand. Do you think hysteria could do that?
It's being doing it for centuries. She's not unique, she's just another victim.
God's victim. That's her innocence. She belongs to God.
And I intend to take her away from Him. That's what you're afraid of isn't it?
Playing with something really hot. Yeah.
What have you ordered?
Not that one!
And don't be so obvious!
Quit showing off! We're here on business!
Mostly relief that I managed to stagger through it at all...
It doesn't seem long to me. It seems short. I think the whole thing about pets dying s-s-sucks!
To remember.
That's what I think. I heard Missy Dandridge tell Mom when Church was fixed he wouldn't cross the road so much.
In the end he's gonna croak, isn't he?
Understand? I'm sorry.
My mother and I used to ride a lot, before she got sick.
My Grandpa, used to breed horses on his farm so I would come over and ride all the time.
Ben Schwarz.
German.
Please, Nicholas, let me show you...
I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you.
Yes, I understand. Thank you.
You were attacked. My God. Should I call a doctor! Did you call the police...
You're all right... you sure...
... So... where did you sleep last night?
Please... before you go on... let me tawk... okay... We've had a wonderful time together... When we first met, you said this wasn't serious and I shouldn't get serious and then you moved in and we haven't been serious. And I just wanna say that I have no regrets. None. And don't wanna have any now so I want ya to be up front with me... I want the truth. If you're seein' somebody else, let me know... You don't have to pour gasoline on yourself and light a match just to break up with me. Just tell me the truth.
No, no, no, it's more like, who is he, does he have a sense of humor, is he nice -- no forget nice, I've got nice --
She quit this afternoon.
We made the date three months ago.
Herb Shuttle is taking me to a fight.
I hate that thing.
Ed... I just stuck it out so you could finish your movie. Now that it's done, so am I.
I'm tired of living on the fringe.
Ed, it's over. I need a normal life.
Do you want some gingerbread?
With applesauce?
Alex and Charlie? Simple. Alex is the smarter one.
Nick! Nick! Are you asleep?
No.
Goodnight, Benjamin.
But I don't want you to make up something.
Goodnight.
Did you rig it to do that? You're so clever.
Life's a trade-off. You get cancer, your hair falls out, but you do get to smoke dope.
Mm.
I'm...all right.
Everything's okay?
Yes?
No?
You seem tense. Is everything all right? You feel okay?
That's great Earl!
He doesn't understand... just walk away...
About a job.
You don't need a car you can't drive for a month. Go see Marvin.
I'm asking for real. I want you to turn that camera off and make love with me. Will you?
So why won't you make love with me? Why wouldn't you, I mean?
But I don't understand --
Why not?
But how do you know for sure, you have to try to find a way to fig --
Now?
I don't know. Waiting, I guess. You know?
Why not?
Your Grace, I've got something to tell you. I want to complain about this man.
Where?
No! No! No!
Do you have music up there?
I'd like to hear it. Can you sing something?
I don't know.
I've noticed... Do you understand what they're saying?
Don't be afraid... I'd really like to hear it.
Yeah.
It's like...
It's very monotonous.
It's really slow. It's slow boring.
They're Yorkies and they don't shed.
Who is it?
...I thought I should tell you. I didn't want to get too far along on going out and be hiding something --
It's so cold.
...You can forget about 'em forever and then look at 'em and they're doin' even better than before.
He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch!
Yes.
What's the matter now?
No Meurice, it's worse than that. Something really happened, I think Marty's dead--
Meurice--
It's your fan mail, little sister.
Fine.
I love you!
No, Nick, no --
Nick, please, it's me --
My brother's killed people, I know he has. Truckers. If you talk him into thinking you're not you, you'll only get yourself dead.
He'll kill you.
Oh, I thought you were my eight o'clock. Make it fast, I'm expecting someone.
The silver screen's loss is your gain.
You want to know what Bud's like in bed?
Oh, the best I ever had. Absolutely the best.
I see Bud because I want to. I see Bud because he can't hide the warmth he has inside him.
Where you gonna be during all this?
He said it made sense that Gary's code was like Teddy's, that that clich about great minds was true. Said it was all about his own guilt. Plus, he has a tendency to get Gary mixed-up with his dad once in a while. It always passes.
I don't think he knows how.
I always felt if a -- boy I liked ever found out -- he'd run. He'd think I was unclean.
Bud, this is me, Lindsey. Okay? You know me better than anybody in the world. Now watch my lips... I saw these things. I touched one of them. And it wasn't some clunky steel can like we would build... it glided. It was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.
Bud, something really important is happening here.
Who's hysterical? Nobody's hysterical!
I saw something! I'm not going to go back there and say I didn't see it when I did. I'm sorry.
I need you to believe me, Bud. Look at me. Do I seem stressed out? Any of the symptoms of pressure sickness, any tremors, slurred speech?
I think I left it there, I'm sorry.
I had an accident - I fell down stairs...
No he had to - he's just - he's out...
Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
Say it anyway. Come on, how much do you love me?
Here.
But you were having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
It's Saturday.
It isn't. Not by a long shot. He holds her and they lie silently for a moment--
Yeah?
Go ahead--punch.
FUCK YOU! Have fun living with your dad for the rest of your life!
I had a lot to do with that little press conference last night--
Just what do you want from me, anyway? Permission to be a fake? Stop whining and do something about it.
It's hard for me to advise you since you personify something that I truly think is dangerous.
I agree with you -- you're not qualified. So get qualified. You can insist on being better prepared. You don't have to just leave it as... 'I don't write. I'm not schooled. I don't understand the news I'm reading. But at least I'm upset about it, folks.'
You're the one who's still living out some stupid seventh-grade fantasy!
Oh, don't go, okay? Please.
You're saying this only to make me go.
No.
But what about us?
Of course it is.
Do you want to?
So. I guess we just divorce our spouses, marry each other, and have this baby, right? Simple.
Is that Cristaile?
Yes.
Has he asked to see the book yet?
Probably the caffeine.
No problem.
So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- -- You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you?
You're one man. You can't save everybody.
I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne.
Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself.
You never told me.
I can't have a baby alone. I don't even know if he's coming back!
He's going to be dropping bombs on Mandalay! They're going to be shooting at him!
Burma!
I'll go pay for my car.
Are you sure?
I should have never married him. He's a Gemini. A triple Gemini... duality. Gemini's the snake. You know you can't trust the snake. I mean it.
Can I come in?
He gives a fuck what I do?
There's hot cider in the kitchen.
Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
You didn't kill anybody. Stop.
I shouldn't drink when I'm driving.
Cheers.
Don't be too sure. Just because I wear a uniform -- that doesn't make me a Girl Scout.
You shouldn't.
I don't blame you. It was unforgivable.
Daniel, just forget Argon. Let's get out of here. We'll find another way to stop the waste.
I read you were shot five times in the tabloids.
And if you hadn't been pretty darned interested in that script, he wouldn't have tried to get me on the phone ten times.
Don't play innocent. Somebody named Gordon Cole.
I saw these in the Penny's catalog, and I just knew I had to have them. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it?
No Father, they're edgy. On alert. Like they act when they smell a predator around... Peeing on themselves and everything.
What?!
What?! What d'you think?!
Oh.
We probably shoulda filled up the car before we blew up that truck.
Why?
They'll probably catch us when we have to stop for gas!
I know this whole thing was my fault. I know it is.
There's one thing you oughta understand by now, Thelma, it's not your fault.
Louise... no matter what happens, I'm glad I came with you.
You're crazy.
Where's your coat and hat?
I have to go now, before it gets light.
I'm not sure but look. . .
You need to go.
It's bad.
I know exactly what I'm doing. Get out!
Charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late -
Too late for what? Too late for you and this - this public thief to take the love of the people of this state away from me? Well, you won't do it, I tell you. You won't do it!
Get out! I've got nothing to talk to you about. If you want to see me, have the Warden write me a letter.
Charlie, you're just excited. You don't realize -
What happened to us, exactly?
Get out, both of you!
Why did you say those things?
What are you asking me?
Yes, I considered it.
I came here. I had no money. I knew no one. I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money. I considered it, but... it's not who I am. They pay me below the table at Ludwig's.
No.
No.
Yes.
Hello.
What are you doing out there? Are you crazy?
Come on. I'm not gonna go if you don't come.
Mommy's sick, guys.
So what's up? Who's marrying who this time?
Enrique! Quienes son estos? How could you bring them here?
Grammy had a different kind. There are lots of kinds. Hers was very bad.
I promise.
Have you ever been in love?
One would have to be in love with somebody to know that.
Not really... It's suffocating in here... Shall we go out?
At what?
Where do I charter a boat?
I not doing this for me, Jack! It's for my father. This is possibly the greatest anthropological discovery of the last two hundred years! It belongs to him! I'm going to that island ... nothing's going to stop me!
I came to make a clean breast of everything... the whole business.
No. He's French, he was just in Italy for the competition.
Actually, I was married. For four years. But... well, we didn't fit together. I'm divorced now.
Oh, well... I guess you... in high school, you were a pretty good first baseman. And we were on the debate team together. But... I think you were gonna run the Bijou. You were brought up there, and you loved it so much. And I think you knew how much the town needed a place like that.
Sorry. You don't know how many times I've heard that. "A lady lawyer? Are you crazy?" Like a woman couldn't be as good a lawyer as a man. Or better, in fact.
You... don't remember, but yes, ever since I was a little girl.
Hmm. I'd say eight, maybe nine.
Umm. Altogether?
15.
17.
With four of them, I didn't use any kind of protection. Wait, maybe it was three.
U-huh.
My name is Camille -- Camille Johnson and I'm the Supervisor of this school. What's your name?
Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a chat with did very little spoiling.
My job, Bruce. I started it -- and I'll finish it.
I'll come a-running, pardner.
No. I was busy. Yes, I need the new poll fig.... how long? I'll call in from Nashville. And patch me through to the Big Bird, will...? I've got to hand it to you. They sure let us out of there easy....
Oh, yes.
At the roulette table, trying to win enough for our exit visa. Well of course, he's losing.
Eight weeks. We come from Bulgaria. Oh, things are very bad there, Monsieur. A devil has the people by the throat. So, Jan and I, we, we do not want our children to grow up in such a country.
Yes, but we have not much money, and traveling is so expensive and difficult. It was much more than we thought to get here. And then Captain Renault sees us and he is so kind. He wants to help us.
He tells me he can give us an exit visa, but we have no money.
Can you love a player?
Then kiss me again for I am not mistook.
...Yes --
M'hm.
A loser?
You can read it, if you want to. You want to go out for a while? To a movie?
No. You?
Jake...
But Jake... I didn't say anything...
Why?
It might be paranoia, but I've never lost my keycard before.
Jack.
Cyril!
You've been here before?
Did it work?
What are his symptoms?
Yes. Yes. That's exactly it. Yes.
Why do I feel like I'm on a blind date?
You have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people.
She fell down.
Yes. I hated her for coming between my mother and father. She kept me from seeing my father. I went down there to ask her where he was. She wouldn't tell me, and I shot her.
Why... in the heart.
Who?
You're a fool!
Not with strangers.
You're a good man, Mr. Kringelein -- a very good man.
Madam, it is Mr. Meierheim -- he is waiting downstairs.
Nonsense! We'll find a great doctor, he'll cure you. They can cure anything these days.
Where is Pimenov? Where is Pimenov?
Sure. The keys are on the dresser next to... to your book.
It's just that, you know, I was thinking about how, in class, you're always telling us 'that writers make choices -- at least the good ones. And, don't get me wrong. I'm not saying the book isn't really great -- I mean, really great -- but at times it's, well, very detailed, you know, with the genealogies of everyone's horses and all the dental records and so on -- and I don't know, maybe I'm wrong, but it sort of reads, in places, like, well, actually, like... ...you didn't make any choices at all. And I was wondering if it might not be different if, maybe, when you wrote, you weren't always... under the influence.
What do I have that you don't?
Sure, carnation. Like in that movie you rented, Audrey Rose.
Do you believe that?
You're moving away? When?
I don't get it.
I'll be with you always, my friends. Who knows, maybe if I'm lucky, I'll rejoin you with wings and a beak.
2:00 A.M.
Ed, this spaghetti sauce is delicious.
What was that?
Oh, God!
Oh, wow!
That'll be all today, Mr. Carter. You've been most understanding. Good day, Mr. Carter!
How long will that be?
That would be okay.
Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
Phil for God sake.
It's going to be slow from now on. Do you know what I mean, Harry?
Very slow. But we're not going to stop, are we?
No, we're not.
Goodbye, Harry. It was very good to see you again.
Excuse me?
He's Satan hiding behind the Cross!
He taken the Lord's name in vain and he trampled on His Holy Book!
I hate snails and blue cheese. Especially together. Hate.
Gee, that's sad. Don't that make you sad?
I'm sorry... I didn't mean it to sound uncaring...
Why don't you go away?
Except you.
Wouldn't it be better if you put her in... someplace...
No, not like me.
I came to see you. How you feel?
Why always on this night?
You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
That's enough. Go join the others, and don't come back here. And you'll have to control your temper.
How the hell do you find me anyway?
Help yourself. Everyone else has.
I'm still second best.
I don't fly in anything that doesn't show movies.
Danger?
Doesn't it ever bother you?
I'm nervous. You don't need to be nervous around me, though. I like you. Do you think I'm repulsively fat?
You're very nice. God, I have to stop saying that. You're nervous around me, huh?
Well, for the last week, anyway! He's kind of a kid. Kind of a goofball, but he's really stuck on me, which is flattering. Who wouldn't like that? And he's, like, a dope, but he says these smart and moving things sometimes, out of nowhere, that just break my heart. He's the one who gave me that crow photograph.
I don't either. I used to. But I'm through with that. Y'know, if I don't love my body, then I'm just lost. You know? With all the wrinkles and scars and the general falling apart that's coming 'round the bend. So, I've been seeing this guy...
That made me cry. But, anyway, we went up to Boston, because I had this urge to lie on my back on the Charles River. It gets frozen this time of year.
If you're not at my place by 7.00, Tom and I are running off together.
Look, I know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay? I mean forget the logic part...But I keep thinking if Charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.
No. I don't think so.
Three. And add some basil.
No, not really... I guess it's different if you don't have children, but...I dunno, even if Charley and I don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if Charley was to marry again...He'd still be my husband. That stuff about "Till death do you part?" That's really true.
I'll be all right, Chauncey you go ahead with Mrs. Aubrey...
No, no! I don't want to go! I don't want!
No! I don't want to leave you!!
... Especially the sneakers.
Still makin' jokes?
We drinkin' buddies now?
Sure.
Most men wouldn't do what he done. If they can get a girl they go right ahead and get her -- I guess to hell they do, just like a dern rabbit. 'Course later they'll tell her she's no good when they done the same thing their selves. They're a bunch of monkeys. I like 'em, but they're a bunch of monkeys.
He wasn't able to get out of bed today.
He has never gotten rid of the malaria. He is usually up and at it the next day. I'm going to make him fresh chicken broth.
Sure. Maybe coffee.
Can you watch Gideon for a while? One of the girls is going into labor. Junior is going to drive me over.
Maybe I want to feel badly.
They'll come around. Close your eyes, I wanna bring out the gorgeous color in them. The first rule in applying eye makeup, is you can never wear enough blue eye shadow.
I was talking to the priest, and do you know what he said to me?
Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much. Go in and tell my lady I am gone, having displeased my father to Father Lawrence to make confession and be absolved.
What?
Amen
And from my soul too. Else beshrew them both.
So. What's that thing?
If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her.
I want you to take care of me... And I love when you do things to me.
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.
What do you make with that?
Water or mineral deposits.
Tell me. When will the doctor be awake?
What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles. When we knew he was right here in the hotel.
But he will be available? Perhaps later this morning?
Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him. Nothing unusual. Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand.
There's no hurry! The race is over!
We got some soldiers in traction from a jeep accident, but it's quiet. Except for the occasional fighter plane buzzing us.
You don't have to explain.
Plus, you could use that commission.
I'm relieved you said that.
Yeah, what happened there.
Oh good.
It's true. Birdson knew your name, he was writing it in numerical code. It wasn't easy but I figured it out. It spelled your name.
He's still sitting in that damn field.
O, she says nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, and then on Romeo cries and then falls down again.
Sir. Ah, sir. Death the end of all
O God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? O serpent heart hid with a flowering face. Was ever book containing such vile matter's so fairly bound? O, that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace.
I wasn't eavesdropping, I was overhearing.
What? How can you say that? He's the one that put you in that goddamn medieval...Jacket. He's probably the one who killed you.
One night with me!
Believe it.
All right, what you want to do is go to the Free Clinic and tell the doctor that you have sex regularly -- several times a week -- and that you need Nornel One Plus Fifty's.
I can't believe I start high school tomorrow.
And don't let them talk you into a diaphragm either.
Not if you're over sixteen.
...See you tomorrow night.
I was going to say - if you want to eat with us, ever you and Lieutenant Singh
Kip's another one.
Hello.
You saved my life. I haven't forgotten. I thought you were very very tall. You seemed to big - a Giant - and I felt like a child who can't keep her balance.
Since Caravaggio turned up - food seems to appear, so please.
Oh, I thought I saw you.
Did you come home during the day last week?
I was down the street.
Olive told me. You might have told me yourself.
You just stay out of trouble, Homer!
Pat, this is my cousin Vanden and her boyfriend Stash. He's an artist.
So what do you do?
Not when it's my ass on the line you don't. We do this my way or fuck it.
Sheronda passin' the money onto someone else, that's what the hell I'm talkin' 'bout.
I don't want no more fuckin' surprises. We do this the way I laid it out, or we don't do it at all.
I know, but I hung around, 'cause I figured you'd try an' pull some shit like this.
Grant, as you do everything else, with treachery. Offer him a truce to discuss terms, and send me to my castle at Locharmbie as your emissary. He trusts me. Pick thirty of your finest assassins for me to take along. And I will set the meeting, and the ambush.
Because my son is here. And his father is here. As a mother, I don't want my child to be separated from his father.
Oh yes, my sister's just... she's... wonderful.
I should say something in this about magic.
What?
I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.
Don't bother the poor boy. It just takes some people a little longer to figure out who they are.
Tell me.
How?
No, I mean how would you do it? Do you just sneak in real fast or hide out till the store closes or what?
You're a bank robber?
What?
Well...
About Eve. I've acted pretty disgracefully toward her, too.
Silly, isn't it? You'd think they'd fix it so people could just sit in a car and keep warm...
I don't suppose the heater runs when the motor doesn't?
Isn't that what they always say?
Not to you. Not to Bill.
Those years stretch as the years go on. I've seen it happen too often.
Margo. Bill is all of eight years younger than you.
Bill's in love with Margo Channing. He's fought with her, worked with her, loved her... but ten years from now - Margo Channing will have ceased to exist. And what's left will be... what?
Why should he - and why should you?
Mister Washington.
I don't think anybody should change their names, that way you can always find them when you need them.
Well, that's that. Stay there, Nick!
No. Are you tired?
I told you that I was doing fifty miles an hour when the accident happened. That's how I remembered it. But the truth is, I might have been doing sixty. Or sixty five. And if that's true, that I was over the limit when the bus went over, what would happen then?
Because I'd be to blame, right?
We're not gonna let it.
Morning, darling.
I don't like to come here, Roy. Every time I do, your mother comes in and makes remarks.
Choco grew up on the streets of El Salvador. When he was four years old... he stabbed another kid in the eye-ball with a pencil. There were wires crossed somewhere in his soul.
She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen.
There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that.
I have a suggestion. There's really not much time left - I mean, you haven't had a minute alone yet, and - well, I could take care of everything here and meet you at the gate with the ticket... if you'd like.
Of course not.
Eve. I'd forgotten they grew that way...
Did she tell you about the Theater and what it meant?
All the religions in the world rolled into one, and we're Gods and Goddesses... isn't it silly, suddenly I've developed a big protective feeling for her - a lamb loose in our big stone jungle...
Take care of yourself out there...
That's why I'm crying.
That's Jellybean!
FROM MEN, THE WHOOPING CRANE HAS RECEIVED NEITHER LOVE NOR RESPECT. MEN HAVE DRAINED THE CRANE'S MARSHES, STOLEN ITS EGGS, INVADED ITS PRIVACY, POLLUTED ITS FOOD, FOULED ITS AIR, BLOWN IT APART WITH BUCKSHOT.
God! I don't believe I'm doing this. I don't.
Where will he go?
Epps, you're smarter than this. Jaeger I understand, but you're smarter.
Yeah. I called the number yesterday to make sure. Thomas Becker, retired M.D.
They're not here.
No.
What? What are you thinking?
Yeah.
In the room?
You didn't say anything about my hair.
Oh.
Don't be silly. How bad?
Yeah, there's an Olympic size swimming pool up on the roof. Take the stairs over there.
I've just met with the bishop. We're taking you off the case.
Up to you. I'd like to go early and leave pretty soon after that.
So what were you doing in the Williams' basement anyway?
Really?
Okay.
Dick, Jane, and Spot.
It would be my child.
Should I be afraid?
I'd never get an abortion.
Sure. Have a good night.
What are you reading?
Somerset Maugham.
Oh, God, I don't even know what I want.
I'm all right. I just can't stand to see people tied up. I'm in the waiting room for hours, listening to Noel screaming. The only reason he's screaming is 'cause he's tied up.
It doesn't make a difference! I have to move out!
What's the difference?! It's just somebody I met!
Yeah.
I'll never forget you said it.
No I'm not.
Let's talk about something else.
Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
Isn't that the difference between a good cop and a bad cop? A good cop can't sleep 'cause a piece of the puzzle's missing. A bad cop can't sleep 'cause his conscience won't let him. You said that once, remember?
About an hour ago. Said he was more than happy to cooperate.
It's you Ben who needs to talk. I've had my say, and I'm waiting to hear back from you.
I-
Yes.
Good night.
I wouldn't expect too much. I mean about her coming back. Once a girl gets into the life.
You wife isn't dead is she?
Not now, Donnie. It isn't a good time.
He hates me.
He hates me.
I don't think. I know. He looks at me like I'm the ugliest thing in the world. He doesn't like my friends--he--
Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock?
A ghost?
I got the money all packed. I put the jeep in the garage. Figure that way people will think maybe me and Jake went away. Might buy us some time.
Had push it in. Funny thing; it wouldn't start.
I promise not to bring any more Venuses and not to worry - and not to try to get in touch with any of the papers -
Do you have any children with anyone?
How long with Paula?
What is that? Oh my God, it's your conscience.
She doesn't know.
Addison, won't it be just perfect? Lloyd and I - there's no telling how far we can go... he'll write great plays for me, I'll make them be great! You're the only one I've told, the only one that knows except Lloyd and me...
You have no right to say such things!
I'm in love with Lloyd!
Yes, it made me cry it was so beautiful...so romantic.
Is that what you think? Is that what you think I think?
But not all of it - not that Lloyd and I are going to be married.
She knows enough not to be here.
You were a smoker?
Two packs a day.
... Thank you.
You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
Yes... I...
You can call me Sister.
I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
I can beat that.
Unfiltered.
Do you have to wear that hat?
When we were eleven years old cause he was about to lose.
Rotate 90 degrees counterclock wise.
No. I won't talk to you where you can use your hands on me.
I'm seeing...snow... lots of snow. Way up North. Are we getting hot?
Okay, let's see...I'm not promising anything. You okay?
You live in...Alaska. The only way in or out of your place is by plane and... you've definitely come down here for food and supplies and... to find a wife!
I'm sick of it. I can't watch you this way. You're too drunk all the time. There's too many girls. I can't... I don't wanna talk about it. I made up my mind.
It doesn't matter.
You don't remember?
I wouldn't have made it by myself.
Mother, father, sister.
Younger.
Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. I was just over in the library there, asking a mess of questions about -- I guess they call it epidemiology? -- and the fella there told me to find you, cause you know all about it.
Dr. Paulsen?
Gee, I don't know. I guess I'm not cut out to be a World Citizen who experiences everything and nothing at the same time.
Okay, okay.
You're not going back to jail. All we need to do is find the nanobot. Once the meltdown is under control, then we deal with Argon --
What in the hell?
Oh no. They're trying to blame you for the accident. That means they must not have been able to control the replicators.
Why?
Mom, I'm sorry. I wanted to tell you. But it never felt right.
That was very good.
That's not true.
I think playing in a band called "Bitch" might put a dent in the whole "perfect family" thing.
He loves you very much. He just--
Yes it is. Can we please not do that? Please? Cause it is.
I'm warning you, don't tempt me.
Miss Burton? Do you still work at Wyant Wheeler?
Were you recently promoted?
Thank you.
It was just the ether, Wilbur...
Yeah, a headache. My head hurts. You're making me uncomfortable.
Hing, hang, hung.
James...
It is so considerate of you.
I don't smoke dubes and I don't really hang out. But I'll go back. Okay.
Sounds like you may be on to something.
What, what's there to think about? The scene's perfect...I, I get to say...
If they're so rich, why are you working at all ?
Well, whatever you think.
I like a place with lots of life.
Someone get a doctor.
My six year-old here keeps telling me he wants to be a policeman. Right after he retires from the majors. We just gave him a badge and a whistle for his birthday.
Wait...
Don't sit down.
Yeah. I'm so glad we did this.
Well, my parents split up when I was thirteen, and... god, I actually had to... I went into court and I had to choose between the two of them. So I chose my dad. It just felt safer that way, you know?
The range should be between fifteen and seventeen-point-five percent of the P.O.E....to even consider it.
Available cash is not an issue for us...
One game. One-on-one.
You going to let him? You going to reward him by being the son he was never man enough to be a father to?
Oh yes, and who are you? He's worked for Kings. For the Emperor. Who are you?
You know what's ridiculous? Your libretto, that's what's ridiculous. Only an idiot would ask Wolfi to work on that stuff!
Money! Money!
I'm leaving. I'm not working there anymore. I'm scared!
I told what's his name -- Tom -- that I'd meet him.
I have to be somewhere.
If all that happened, how come you're so chipper?
There were complaining phone calls because you were sweating?
I don't know. I may be in love with him.
I planted a row just for you and you don't owe me anything.
I don't know who you are.
And is your heart beating strangely?
Yeah?
Look! Please! Don't do the "shucks, ma'am" thing again! I've driven a few thousand miles for a few minutes of your time. I've brought him here -- to your neck of the... -- mountains. Just take a look at him. If you still feel the same way, I'll be on the road by morning and you'll never see me again. OK? Deal?
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
Well... yes... I had a trailer. It's not like I made him run along side of the car.
...what...?
Yeah.
I just...your face is so adorable and your cheek and your skin, I wanna bite it....I wanna bite your cheek and chew on it....god damn cute....fuck....
Oh my god, you are so adorable. I just....god dammit.
I don't want to hear about her anymore.
I'm not accusing. I'm asking. Do you...do you find me too...too giving? Too-too-too competent? Too-too, I don't know, disgustingly perfect or something?
Well, what is it then? What? Eh, what's come between us? How have I alienated you?
Eladio. Eladio. Cruz.
Did we want to?
I don't know... too late to stop it.
Too late for what?
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
For what? An abortion?
I didn't guess until it was too late.
And you didn't send her to a doctor.
Yes.
Did you know she was pregnant?
Is it because she's a nun?
Was it you?
Of course I know --
You're just afraid to eat it.
It's gonna get cold.
I got some vodka in the freezer.
I am not living with him. I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. You know that, don't you? I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run. Probably nothing.
You're killing him. You're killing him for nothing. Stop it.
What?
Did you say something?
Rob. Don't be childish.
You're not only an animal, you're a stupid animal. You're rotten. Rotten. Rotten. You're a sick maniac. A maniac! You belong in a mental hospital.
What for? There's nothing more to say. Get my car, please.
WHAT!! She was dying!
Oh, all that work.
Oh, no. I've got my own car. The creamcolored Packard.
Thank you.
Hi, Al!
This guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest. Wait. Use the frosted glasses.
Carl Smith. He's a medical student. We've known him for years.
Ted, I'm leaving you.
Yes.
So much.
You heard him. I'm a star!
That isn't true! Max?
No biggie. I have an extra in my locker. I'll get it for you.
No. Are you drunk?
Come on, Richard, I'm serious.
So am I.
That's why I was getting a divorce.. What I really think is that I had a heart attack at the reunion and died.
I don't know.
You don't seem very sure.
Yes. But it wasn't really. It was just...
What're you doing?
Are you drunk?
Yes, Victor, I was.
Did he give any reason?
Ask me?
-- Yes?
Where's pop?
Well, let's spit on it.
What? He's in Sicily!
Addison, will you please say what you have to say plainly and distinctly - and then get out so I can take my nap!
I never intended you to be.
I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...
Champion to champion.
I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my nap. It's important that I-
Why?
Nothing. So good luck.
You really should be a caterer or something like you used to say.
Child, take a bite.
Listen Dad, please. Buy IBM, buy Polaroid, buy Apple Computer. No, no. Not yet. Buy Xerox!
Which way?
We're no leaving you!
Yes.
It was nobody's fault.
Since right after we lost our son.
That was our apartment.
How can you tell it's a female?
No thank you. We should be off.
You said that the last time.
They hear you comin'. They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em.
How do you know he's still not here?
Which Times guy?
I never knew when to hold it--or who to ask, or what to say.
What then?
John! Don't!
Now can I tell?
I don't have a memory and I'm not a Princess! Even if I were - no one's ever going to believe it. I'm not exactly...
You never said anything to me about having to prove I'm a Princess!
That thing you said before. Pushing the guy sleeping next to you away. Because of what you gave up for motherhood...
Well, she was.
Shhhh. Just stay with me. Stay with me. Everything is forgiven. Everything.
Beloved..She's mine I am Beloved
..I swallowed her blood right along with my mother's milk. She played with me and always came to be with me whenever I needed her. Me and her waited for our daddy. I love her. I do. She never hurt me. I love my mother but I know she killed one of her own, and tender as she is with me, I'm scared of her because of it. All the time, I'm afraid the thing that happened that made it all right to kill her own, could happen again. Whatever it is, it comes from outside this house, outside the yard. So I never leave this house and I watch over the yard so it can't happen again ... I have to keep it away from my sister...I'll protect Beloved...'Cause She's mine...
You know as well as I do, Stamp, that people who die bad don't stay in the ground.
Are we hoping the ghost is going to have to pee?
Place your fingers on the planchette.
The planchette?
I heard it from everyone who said I didn't hear it from them! Do you know Dmitri?
You are. You're losing your mind. What about Walter?
I love you, Chuck.
I had to come. To be sure you were okay.
I'm so glad you're alive.
She has pretty red hair... she is very kind I think.
Yes, Vada I think you're very pretty. You've got these great big sparkling eyes, the cutest little nose, an amazing mouth.
Yes.
Good, Jack. Maybe we ll keep her.
Huh! And they say charity s only rewarded in Heaven... Hallelujah... Christ...
That s right. Where s the fucking Italian, eh, Mr French hero?
Look at him, Whitney. Come all the way from England to clean up California. Huh!
Mm.
I don't know anymore. I thought I was, but obviously I was wrong.
Don't you get lonely?
And now you can?
How come?
So you lied to her?
Yes, yes, yes, yes... Right away...
But why am I so infatuated with you?
So... Oh, how I wish that everything were so much simpler... that people could just come together by the color of their hair or the size of their shoes. What size shoe do you wear? Size 9. That's a very lovely size. But I'm sorry, I wear size 8.
And are you sure you want to marry me? Are you really sure...that you want to marry... me?
And you leave me here all alone... in this hotel room...
I told her you were a big record executive and you were thinking of signing that band to your label.
Just wait here.
It just slipped out.
Michael...
Michael you're trying to scare me...
Al Capone!
Michael, I don't want to hear anymore...
-- oh that's too bad, it's so great over there and if you were there we could say hello to each other or something --
-- well, if you're gonna go --
Really?
What's the matter? Did you two have a fight?.
I'd like to go back. James...
Damn! Why you trippin' like that?
-- I don't know, I feel like you always pushin' up on me, gettin' close and I love you baby, in every way you can love a bitch, 'cept that one.
Ain't nuthin' wrong wit' it.
Fuck that nigga. Let him go woof on some other scrub. We got one another, s'all the love we're ever goin' need.
My last lesson's next week. James... my car...
...So you heard from Keith? He still fuckin' with that 'lil light-skinned girl?
I ain't tryin' to break a sweat for that sorry ass nigga.
Your impression is very reassuring, Brother. Of course she's had troubles, poor thing, but I sensed that was that the girl was like and I'm glad to have it reconfirmed.
Everybody says you were a grand detective.
Well, I'm not having any. Even if it's not poisoned. I don't think it's right. It's not patriotic.
It looks....foreign.
How do we know they didn't plant it there? They know we're mad on jam. They could poison half the country.
We don't know anything about it
Yes, ma'am.
Hey Karl, you know what? Melinda was voted employee of the month at the Dollar Store last February. Isn't that somethin'?
It's Lydia, your wife.
Oh, Jake.
I like the gym smell.
Jake...
Dance then?
I'd given you up.
I'm so sorry.
Have you been camping? You could use a scrub.
... I think it would be best if you both left.
I'd prefer you didn't. I'm very busy.
Detective...
What happened?
No.
Oh. I didn't look at my faxes today. We left before sunrise.
Wow!
Shelly, do you think I'm pretty?
No, the milk comes when the baby comes.
When he was baby we called him "Wa Wa," a baby name, you know. You will find him a very good boy. His brother can be bad and so can his sister, but Waski is a very good boy. And as you can see he's beautiful.
Hush!
His blood! It's driving them crazy! We have to mask the odor!
I said pretty much the same thing to my mother when I was your age.
It's a puzzle box. If you can figure out how to open it there's supposed to be a treasure inside.
When did you umm, I mean umm...
Oh, my God!
Is that the going rate for saving the woman you love?
I don't know--
We don't want to push her away. These are growing experiences.
But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
Two ships that pass in the night should always buy each other breakfast.
Why not? We already know each other's secrets.
Fair.
No thank you.
I just want a salad. You really think I'm a loser, don't you?
Boy...Holly...Holly.
Yeah, okay, right. Forget it. What's to eat?
Oh, please! We all came to have lunch, didn't we?
You never have any faith in my plans. You always undercut my enthusiasm.
I'm frightened of you, Bruce. I'm frightened for you.
This doesn't make any sense; you are going to drag that poor boy out in the cold air.
Bonjour Monsieur... Louis.
Why are you here, why are you doing this? Coming in here -- you wanna call me a whore?
And gives it to you.
I'll tell you later -- where you going to watch from?
Then I'll come back, then.
I'll pay your salary plus five thousand dollars if you find out what happened to Hollis and who is involved.
I so wish I'd known.
Well, whoever did this is amazing.
I did it.
How do you know what my father thought - -
Maguire and me got out by the skin of our teeth. No thanks to you.... What you think of the hair?
Well you've gotta be prepared.
I'm definitely traveling some day.
Uncle Phil just needed a change, a little adventure.
I wonder why she got a passport if she never went anywhere.
What was it, Fergus? Did you blow the gaff on us or did you just fuck up?
No. That's the last thing I'll do. You never asked what happened.
Eddie and Tinker died.
She'll be here in a moment. She has a special surprise for you.
Thirty-two dollars.
Neat, yeah.
Fifteen-aw, come on, you're... yeah, really?
M'hm...
Oh, yeah.
Right. Well, I don't know, I mean, uh, some of her poems seem - neat, you know.
Of course I'm sweating. I'm burning up. It's hot, moron, only a hundred degrees in here.
You've been doing a bang up job so far. Right now Matt is probably dead and it's your fault.
If they're going to survive here, they have to know how to work, Elalco! Adelante! Los clientes esperan!
You're a good friend.
You, too, sweetie, the best.
You're telling me.
I don't know - I don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .
I don't know. I don't see what this has to do with me.
My father was a pilot. And do I know how to fly?
Do it!
Is it possible. Yes. But --
I don't know. Ultimately their motives may be as incomprehensible as their technology.
You?
The references are to Hansard or to newspapers. I haven't got the actual speeches now. You'll have to chase them up.
You don't know. You don't....
OH MY GOD!
They'll come out after us.
You see where it's coming in?
Well, that's that.
Deepcore, this is Cab One. We need assistance, over. Deepcore, this--
I don't like masquerading, but as you see I decided to give in to your whim.
... yes.
No.
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?
The leaves...
Yes, daddy.
I have to go.
And I'm gonna use the movies when I give my report. Jeffrey says audiences love special effects.
Jeremy phoned this morning
oh.
Wow! Look at all these creeps!
Fine, I'll go by myself then...
"Dear Diane, I'll always be there for you, all the love in my heart, Lloyd." I've never gotten a letter like this, have you?
Lloyd, send her flowers, write her a letter. Something.
You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
Elbows, Son.
Let's eat our cake.
Calvin Webber! What a thing to say!
I do not know him, but I have seen him.
Why, I love my father because - because I do. Of course, he's nice to me.
I mean, does one love a father because he is good and kind - or just because he is one's father?
My last name is Pherides.
I have forgotten it, dear.
Yes...
The add just said quot;Makeup Artist quot;
I know why you broke up with me in college. And not that what you did wasn't messed up, but what I did was, too. So if you forgive me, I'll forgive you.
Stiffs??
Yes it is.
Hmm. Good night.
Yes. Yes, Barbara, I shan't forget.
Promise me you won't forget tomorrow. You'll remember, won't you? You won't say that it was just a dream. Promise me.
Mother! You called me by name!
No. I was just going to have some iced tea then split the atom, but that can wait. I just have to get my shoes.
Yes, Barbara... Barbara...
And my hair...what color hair did Barbara have?
Yes...yes, that's true.
It was pale...a shadowed gold.
Modelling.
Well!
Evan. Stop it. It's not the time.
I don't know if I can quit. We're gonna try it together, like, you know, AA or something. And I made him give up his .22. No more sneaking around the hills with his fucking nut gun like some loony tune.
...What balls on this guy? What're we... ...going steady? Jesus.
I said I'd consider it. Nobody owns me. And the last thing was insane. I don't know what's wrong with him... No magazines.
He said -- "Which we already knew!"
First off, he tells me to stop smoking cigarettes. I told him abso-fuckin'- lutely no. As you can see --
She never told anyone else. About the convict strain -- or is it stain? No, I was privileged. I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past.
You just travel around, no direction, no steady work. You must like taking chances.
and there she was lying dead. The police said she'd probably been killed about ten minutes before I got there.
Every one of these songs will remind you of me in a slightly different way...
Why, you said...
I said 'excited'. Not agitated, he was excited in the sense of being overjoyed.
Who?!
Not a thing.
I don't need you to be telling me to...
Twenty-seven.
The characters you meet. Something happens to men in elevators. Must be the change of altitude -- the blood rushes to their head, or something -- boy, I could tell you stories --
Couldn't happen to a nicer guy. You know, you're the only one around here who ever takes his hat off in the elevator.
I want you to listen to me. My father is a very dangerous man. You don't know how dangerous. You don't know how crazy.
You may think you know what's going on, but you don't.
It's possible.
It's possible. Please don't ask me any more questions now. Just wait, wait for me. I'll be back. I need you here.
You bastard.
You can trust me.
No.
I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond?
Why did she call me?
It means I got the money.
...a pocketful of rye.
Really?
But I'll never win that.
I know. Where are you Adam?
You don't have to be so nervous, you know.
Did you get us a room?
Have you gotten us a room yet?
Damn him.
What are they?
I don't know. I can't be alone.
I'll go with you.
Don't.
Well, you shouldn't worry about him too much, David.
Are you sure?
I don't know.
Maybe that would be a good idea.
No. I mean, I remember Mrs. Ansel wearing some of this stuff, but...I don't feel funny about that. I really liked her.
Baby laxative? We can't snort baby laxative.
What was?
Pretty, ain't it? You a plumber?
Decency? Hey listen, pal ...
You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
That's all you care about. You don't care about me at all.
Okay, okay.
Okay.
No, you don't.
Yes?
Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
You promised, Tommy.
It doesn't matter. It was the feeling I was affected by.
I'm Mary's sister.
May I talk to you?
You gotta keep clear, Tom. The fambly's breakin' up. You got to keep clear.
Is Mary here?
No problem.
Coughing opens up the capillaries. When you cough, you're getting air -- in this case smoke -- to parts of the lung that don't normally get used. Coughing's good -- gets ya higher. My dad coughs when he smokes all the time.
It's a cockatoo.
You okay?
Now what?
Then let's not get caught.
We're not giving up, Thelma.
Go.
What are you talkin' about?
Go?
Hi. I'm okay. How are you? Long time no see.
Uh. You hate my guts?
Why didn't I?
He only remembers I found him. My point is, telling you this story would have been the kindest, most helpful thing I could ever have done for you.
I don't believe a single word you've said.
...his Triumphal Plane. Shot Down.
And ... wear this on the trip in case it gets cold.
There's a meatloaf sandwich in there too. Don't go skipping dinner just 'cause you're not here anymore.
I had to say goodbye.
I made you these for the trip. They're marshmallow rice squares.
Oh, you know...I talked to Hannah this morning on the phone, and she said that you two might be going to the country for the weekend.
A wife knows.
But it doesn't matter. Really, I'm not interested in playing music professionally.
No. He did not.
God, that's terrible.
I'm not sick, Richard. I'm just not tired, now go back to sleep before you're up for the whole night too!
We're Japanese, not Mexican, Ishmael. He'll slice you up with a ceremonial sword.
Brazen it through? Brazen it through? They're going to hang us out to dry like the laundry --- do you know what we've ddd...
She's bringing Stargher into hers.
I'm only sorry that I didn't play better for you. I know it would've made you happy. You know what you are?
I always knew that boy had an imagination, but now he's gone and made up a whole new life for himself. Do you mind if I sit down? He's been living with me and his uncle Henry since he was a baby. And we don't live in Manhattan. We live in Boerum Hill. In the projects.
Before... when I was one of them. I would look at this and it was just strangers. Now I... remember.
You want me to stay?
Do you still want me to stay?
Like a drum.
I've never seen sea so blue. Tahiti is magnificent, Scottie.
I don't see the point in that.
Scottie...
He's right. You'd feel much better about it.
Where do you want to go?
You always say that... I really care for Lester, don't I?
I am you, you little bastard.
No, I blew it, I blew it with Lester.
You don't think so? I do.
I live. In the same country.
Maybe. Can't really tell yet.
I don't know, Grady. I just dropped him on a corner.
I told you, Sewickly Heights.
My God, what have you done to him!
But why? Why?
I like them. I was sick of looking at this room. I think they add a little life.
O God, I have an ill-divining soul. Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low, as one dead in the bottom of a tomb. O fortune, fortune. Be fickle, fortune, for then I hope that thou will not keep him long but send him back.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.
Yeah?
You got it, a great spender of other people's money.
No baby, you got it wrong.
Oh, no.
He was trying to tell me something.
All right.
You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan.
You want his name?
...got promoted to two stars, but he was never military, you know, always CIA. Went to Vietnam, lost his credibility when we got beat over there, retired, lives in Virginia. I say hello to him when I see him at the supermarket...
No?
Which one, this door is locked !
Why should we trust you ?
Why did you?
'Been up north?
Beer okay?
So far, you have four and I only have two!
I want that.
I want brain parasites.
So...what did you think of the tape.
What do you mean?
You're sure? There was nothing?
Yeah.
She wouldn't tell me!
It was like some big fucking secret!
Well, I guess I take after you then!
whirls around and slaps Pauline on the cheek.
...So?
They announced it?
With what?
Listen to me, Bobby. This is my job. It puts a roof over me and my daughter and you for as long as you want to stay.
Look at the bills. I can't. I'm not gonna put my daughter through what I went through.
Ho's a good guy --
Shhh. He'll hear you.
My God, what a disgrace you are! You shame me, you shame the family. You're nothing but a cheap little tart!
She kept saying she was gonna get out of here. Leave us all behind. That he was going to take her!
Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
I don't know.
How do you pay for all this? I mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.
Yes.
Dreyfuss.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
I took sleeping pills.
My arm!
Look for antiques...
Have mercy on this child ... let this child live ...
She used some stupid code name.
Brother and sister still?
Is that what makes it so delicious?
All my life I've known.
I wish to be your wife.
No, it's what body builders drink to beef up.
It's like this major meal in a shake you drink instead of having a big meal.
Want a Metrix?
want to talk to you about something very important.
Oh, Nick... Nick!
Which one?
I think so. They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end. If you want, we could work at your place.
Nobody can be that busy.
Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal. Artie is out of town.
We're engaged.
You're tough, all right.
It's yours, Joe. I gave it to you.
I don't know. Reunions do funny things to people.
I'm so ill, I'm so exhausted -- I almost don't care.
Last night Dr. Drossos -- today you or I -- oh, no, Oliver, it can't be you, I couldn't stand it.
My father -- I'm alone, Oliver, completely alone!
If only we could get away - - you and I. The others are strangers, they mean nothing to me
As one woman to another -- I'm sure she'll understand --
But Wynant --- ?
...I got lost, Mister.
How did the car get back here?
Catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy. When we started, there were a number of test subjects - other therapists - who acted as "receivers." All they did was observe and report. Nothing more. But Catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. She understood. And the patient responded. Edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. He knew she cared.
No.
Yeah.
Do I love you?
Come on. Yeah. You know what? You know, I like you, I really mean it. I really do like you.
Well, I certainly... I think that's very- Yeah, yeah... yeah. Do you love me?
I'll get him.
Oh--no, no!
We should take her to St. Cloud's. That much is obvious, isn't it? Let her make up her mind when she gets there...
You know, I feel a great sorrow for you, because you're laughing now, but by tomorrow night some of you will be dead and having to repeat your jokes in front of God.
Is he there?
You're leaving?
... Nothing.
Of course.
Can't handle them myself is what you mean. Can't.
Look. I know they hate me.
I know how responsible, caring adults parent children. I'm bribe 'em. But 'em a dog or something. Maybe a Doberman.
Tom.
I've run out of words.
Yes, Jeff, away. Away, away, away.
Shit, Jeff!
I don't know. And I don't care that I don't know.
Everything all right.
Oh, Robert, I'm sorry. We were so tired from the branding. Grace barely made it to her bed and I didn't have the energy to take my clothes off.
You were married to a woman in Chicago?
Well, I, uh... you didn't...
So -- are you travelling under R?
You know, the whole world thinks you killed Freddie? It's terrible.
You're kidding.
When I thought about you I was mostly hating you. Where've you been hiding?
Dickie, are you with Peter Smith- Kingsley? I bet you are. My aunt thought she saw him.
Yes, sir.
If you had a chance, unemployed now, to walk off with a half-million dollars, would you take it?
Yeah, I mind. You bet your ass I mind.
What are you doing here?
Yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. Three years later and he's still classified? They gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... Put it in context, Bill, of what we know about Oswald. Lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout - wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the Marines at 17. He learns Russian, he acts overtly Marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in Japan where U2 spy flights over Russia originate. He's discharged from the Marines supposedly because his mother's sick. He stays home 3 days, then with a 1500 ticket from a 203 bank account, he goes to Moscow...
Negative on his tax records. Classified. First time I know a D.A. can't get a tax record. I put together a list of all the CIA files on Oswald that were part of the Warren Report and asked for them. There are about 1200 documents... Oswald in the USSR, in Mexico City, Oswald and the U2, a CIA 201 personnel file, a memo from the Director on Oswald, travel and activities - can't get one of them. All classified as secret on the grounds of national security. It's real strange.
Really.
Finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in Minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has - he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.
Tell me all the details.
Tomorrow, he says.
Kind of.
You didn't?
My ex-husband was a lawyer.
Hi.
Hello... Oh, my God, who did that to you?
It's okay. No problem. Where should we sit?
...and after that Sport and I just started hanging out...
Maybe I just want to hear you say it.
That's not an answer. What is it you want?
All we have to do now is sell it to the President.
And maybe that's why I had the Bad Luck. Maybe if you gave me away, and I got married in a church, in a wedding dress, instead of at the City Hall with strangers standing outside the door, maybe then I wouldn't had the Bad Luck I had.
Well, I don't understand. What did you do -- did you pick my name out of a hat or... or... a list?
Great, bye.
It's my favorite place --
And I do it because they do it, and they do it - it's a vicious circle, isn't it? I'm going over to Georgie's, Brad - you know, Georgie, don't you?
No, I just broke up with him. I'll see you tomorrow.
Say, Brad. I've got an idea.
Rafe... No. You forgive me.
That's what I have to tell you, Rafe. It wasn't a choice. It --
Well, where Mr Carroll uses the word 'love', I look for a new word.
I do. Always. You understand the world better than any of us, Kafka. And what it's becoming. I've always held you in the highest regard.
You WHAT?
Can I, can I not accept gestures and feelings from people? Do I, do I put people off?
You make it sound like, you know, I have no needs or something. You think I'm too self-sufficient?
Thank you. It was a lovely dinner.
I'm in a mess today, too. I'm thinking about doing it with Mike. What do you think?
If I can smoke it.
This is about sex, not like. Mom, Laura's here and I think I will have one of those huckleberry muffins. You want a muffin?
You know, even when I think about your face I get happier.
Okay, L. I am your friend... always. But sometimes... lately... I feel that you don't like being around me because I am so uptight. No, I am uptight. I hate it... I don't want to be this way, but Laura I don't... I mean... I'm your friend no matter what way you are.
No, I want to smoke.
Do you want to talk?
Because I loved Jacqueline I thought I knew her. Today I found out such strange things frightening things. I saw a hangman's noose that she had hanging - waiting I feel as if I'd never known her.
Weren't you afraid?
Donna, you are a muffin.
What about her?
I'm fine.
We were married two years before the baby. And then four very difficult years.
Barton, I'm afraid it's not a good time-
...Who is this?
Hello.
You should be. Can I meet this friend of yours?
I'm intrigued.
Sure. Maybe he's the man I'm looking for. Then I won't have to fuck worried husbands all the time.
I suppose...
Don't flatter yourself.
Yes?
Look, you've never liked me...
She died.
Can you say it?
Tell me you love me.
Please say it.
OK.
Don't you sweet talk me you ol' spook, you!
Give me that shit. Your wife.
Whaddaya talkin' about? There's at least twenty guys in there. Let's wake 'em up and get this party on the road.
Colonel Harper, retired now, dropped an atom bomb on Nagasaki during the Second World War, killing seventy-four thousand people in a flash.
Would you like to say something about killing, Colonel?
Thank you. You can leave now. We'll begin.
You don't know?
Well, okay, but I just want to look at the facilities. That's all.
I don't think you're old and fat enough for me.
This girl is a friend of yours?
You think you're doing these people a favor? What are they going to do? Either they get on welfare or they become criminals--
Good luck.
One.
Now that's true!
Why not?
Who lives?
Tom . .. bed! Go on.
No. I want to know what the hell is going on.
Why not?
We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
It's just that I hate empty rooms.
Chauncey is so sensitive... He was overcome with grief...
... Do you think we should look for him?
I wish he were here...
Lester's on his way.
Are you in love with someone else?
What about you, Manuel?
Yeah, I don't feel so well.
We must start with feathers, dung, and a lock of your hair.
Oh my G-d, I'm so sorry.
Is she a good fuck?
Oh boy... this should be interesting.
Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford.
Only if you can afford it.
Remarried. There is no move.
Yes.
Thanks. I just wish you'd kept the first twenty seconds.
Who was that?
I heard voices.
What's that? Oh! Who gave you this? How much is it? Wolfi, who gave you this?
What?
I hear we must pay for everything. How much for this?
In Ruhengeri?
How are you?
Gay?
Because guys who never say anything about themselves are always married.
Girlfriend?
How long have you been standing there?
I'm not sewing anything else for you!
No!
I'm not sewing anything else.
Well, at least he's tryin'. But who knows for how long.
George, I don't --
I've had these dumb dreams lately.
They're dumb, somebody... I don't know...
I just... who what?
I don't know. I can't remember. It was just in my dream.
Pouring it out!
Not really.
Dad...
Fine.
...school's fine...
Hey.
Why the fuck should I respect her?
Please God. Not on us. Drop it on Mrs. Evans. She's a cow.
It just isn't.
Who's this guy I always see her around?
Annabelle Daniels. 714-454-9346.
Wait a minute, Walter. You can't do that!
That's all you got, lady. Two wrong feet. In fucking ugly shoes.
Nervous?
That's 192 warheads... And how powerful are they?
How many are there?
Michael, I love you.
Jack.
I don't know yet.
I can't say he's been all that effective with her.
You never said anything to me...
It's the Pride of a Job Well Done, Stanley, yes, but it's more than that.
Oh, yeah. I got them thinking Ordell's real nervous. They love thinking he's scared of them.
I told them Ordell's changed the amount he's bringing in.
Don't be so literal. Ray believed it.
All he needed was a reasonable explanation.
Well, you know I'm not going to show him the whole amount. He'll see fifty thousand.
Well, I just don't know how to thank you, Mr. Barnes --
Guess I just got sick of him.
I think I could do that alone.
No, don't tell me you just got fired by your crazy boss.
Well, believe it or not, I am on the prowl for some water records.
Stephen, you gotta stop just showing up on the roof like this.
Stephen, what are you doing here?
It's not your roof anymore.
He's got piano lessons.
He's going to be a fireman.
I wrote sixty-three songs this year. They're all about Joe, and I'm going to play every single one of them tonight.
Love?
I knew you'd like him.
He's a former boyfriend. We lived together for about six months. And yes, I'll admit it. I've still kind of got a thing for him. That's what you wanted to know, isn't it?
What?!
I got a lot on my mind, Aunt Rita.
Everything... everything's so funny...
Nothing...
It means I've finally got a life to live! I don't have to play parts I'm too old for - just because I've got nothing to do with my nights! I know you've made plans. I'll make it up to you, believe me. I'll tour a year with this one, anything - only you do understand - don't you, Lloyd?
Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life.
Now wait a minute, you're always so touchy about his plays, it isn't the part - it's a great part. And a fine play. But not for me anymore - not a foursquare, upright, downright, forthright married lady.
Okay. If you think it will help.
I truly hope so. I'm tired of supporting a grown man.
Scent glands. Insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.
Stop trying to play big brother. I'm a grown woman. You gotta lotta nerve. Mookie, you can hardly pay your rent and you're gonna tell me what to do. Come off it.
If they attack you...
I'm being a pain in the ass. It's beautiful here.
Thanks for helping with the bag. It looks great!
Just because... I would have liked to visit the town... See the coast... I don't know anybody... Expect for you.
I just want some fresh air.
Would you mind opening the window?
Who'd care?
So they'll shoot me -- like a horse.
Why can't I ever fall in love with somebody nice like you?
I know God help me, I know that, Eli. But I tell you that if he's found here, the people who did this to him will come for Samuel.
It's not a joke.
What do you want, hun?
Yeah, same here.
She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
You got kids?
I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
Marcus, I'm tired. That's all.
Morning, Mr. Baxter.
It was making me nervous, so I chopped it off. Big mistake, huh?
You ain't leavin' in no hurry if we can help it!
You have a disease.
Shhh...
Alright!
That was so great!
It's coming along.
...they all yell 'There goes the Virgin Queen' or the 'Ice Princess', or some really clever cut like that. Like it hurts my feelings.
Thanks a lot.
Didn't you ever hear of women's lib?
Why do you want me to go back to my parents? They hate me. Why do you think I split? There ain't nothin there.
God, you are square.
Alright, alright, Eddie. Don't patronize me.
All right?
Fine thanks...
So you left the Church because you had freckles?
No, because I... yeah, yeah I left the Church cause I had freckles.
I'm listening.
My sister died in a convent. And it's her voice I hear. Does my smoking bother you?
No, it reminds me.
Would you like one? Huh?
I'd love one.
I'm out of prac... ... practice.
You called this morning?
Hey. It's Liz.
I'll be fine.
Jon, what is it?
Christ, Jon! How could you do this to yourself? How could you do this to us? Do you know -- do you know what he did to me ...?
He freaked out when he thought I had seen this stuff. I think it's a list of cities -- Santiago, Ho Chi Minh City, Nandi ...
What do you mean?
-- Or maybe all at once. There's a get-together tonight at New St. Marks. For all the bureau chiefs and their families. He's insisted Jamie and I be there too.
I m really sorry you were not called...
Mr Lombard...
This isn't what we agreed on. You guys have to take care of... this! You are the chosen custodians of the big-ass bump!
I want you guys to adopt the Buglet. I wanted everything to be perfect. Not shitty and broken like everyone else's family. Listen, once I have the baby, Vanessa is going to finally be happy, and everything will be all right. Believe me on this one!
But you're old!
I don't know. I just liked being your friend. I sort of liked becoming furniture in your weird life.
Yeah, I guess... Is this my fault? Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?
Oh, he went home to India, but as far as I know he'll be back.
So this is temporary for you?
Yeah, sure. I'm Corky.
I heard you working in here and I just wondered if you'd like a cup of coffee?
Hi. My name is Violet. We sort of met in the elevator --
Who?
Rajeev, the man who usually works on the building.
Two days.
Bud, why are you doing this? It's not part of you life any more.
Look, if you really wanna score some dope, I got the guy.
Not at all.
Hey, Ross. Tell me something. Does PG E pay you to cover their ass, or do you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
The fuck you don't. No one calls me Pattee. That heavy-breathing sicko that called the other night could've only found out about me from you. People are dying, Ross. You got document after document here, right under your nose, that says why, and you haven't said word one about it. I wanna know how the hell you sleep at night.
Yeah.
Right. You can't sleep here.
It's garbage.
Sometimes I think that's what you want.
They're all your enemies?
You personally?
You cannot go alone.
But they never will, Dick. No matter how many elections you win, they never will.
What are you dressed up for? Oh, that's right -- because the Evening News is here this week.
Oh My God, yeah, I know exactly where she is, why?
Not listening !
Hey. What are you doing?
You're so scared.
What about her? You didn't ask her out, you're such a pussy --
Robert, we're losing her. We're losing her. I don't care what the doctors say. The truth is, they don't know anymore than we do -- less, when it comes to Grace... This may not sound sensible or... logical, but nobody's suggesting anything better. I can't explain it, Robert. I just have this feeling... this annoying... bloody feeling that if... if, somehow, Pilgrim can be made all right... then so can Grace. I just know it!
Mr. Creasy, I wanted to make sure you have everything you need.
I'm not crying.
Not personally.
Cunt. It's just a word. Why does everyone in this fucking country get their knickers in a twist by the slightest bit of indecent conversation?
Cunt.
Good. I'm good.
Nothing. There was...I thought I saw something.
Hurry...
After that.
Cunt.
Tomorrow.
I look like some hoochie to you? I found it on your floor.
So I go right back where I was-- carrying compromises--covering up-- back to political tricks--this time for--! No! I was just getting rid of all that. If I did anything , I ought to go and tell him to stand up and--. No! I don't want any part of it! Smith or anything else! I'm all through. I want to be left alone!
Didn't know you cared so much.
You know, there was a guy on the radio today trying to explain why we're losing daylight. Quarks and dark matter, things like that. Even how daylight savings has caught up with us over the last hundred years and our universal watch is just fast, you know?
Bad?
I must really be slacking off. Hungry?
Sushi.
I can't believe it's already starting to get dark so early.
Get down! The ritual chant! Quick! Protect yourself!
Will you read it for me?
I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here.
...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together.
Twelve years.
I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. At least, I used to.
We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this. It works the quadriceps.
I don't like things that make you cry.
U-huh.
Look at her face. A real bitch.
Well, I think it's very simple. Here's a tape of Birdson's exorcism. I'll be at the Public Library. Tomorrow at 2... if you want to meet him.
Yes, I would. That's why I asked.
Paul, will you sign my yearbook?
Oh, God, what did you do?
I did?
I'm so proud of you. You're becoming a woman.
I am?
The money's right here! Get the key!
Now listen. Now that you're on your way, it would be stupid of you to stop. Think of Sebastian as a tutor. Let him instruct you.
Well... I don't know - it was weird. At first it felt icky, then it felt kind of okay. Then, I started getting really hot and then I started shaking and then like, I don't t know... it felt like an explosion, but a good one.
Cecile, you had an orgasm.
He's got money. In a floor safe in the living room. I've never seen it, but he talks about it all the time. More like brags. He loves his money. Wouldn't think of spending some of it on me.
Lainey, there's no evidence that Simone isn't real.
If there was a problem, they could do something right?
What are they for?
Can I come watch you dive tomorrow?
There's hope and promise in it, Jabez -- Planting and promise of good harvest to come.
You'll never change -- will you?
Of course not.
Well, my therapist knows me intimately.
Now, you said never take advice from someone that you don't know intimately, right?
Excuse me for asking, but how would you know?
When I'm not thinking about Wally. I'm not good at being alone. Oh, goodness. You meant... yes, I'm fine. I... ...I don't suppose you've seen a lobster yet.
So since I've never had sex with you, by your own advice I shouldn't accept your advice.
You seem to have had a reason for every other question.
I don't believe you.
Sally?
I swear to you, Argon, if you don't stop the meltdown that nanobot will be the last one I ever build.
You look so well, Clair. A wraith.
How did it happen?
Like what? I'm not --
Our habitat, I mean. This place can't handle another attack.
No I'm not. I'm not star--
You're crazy --
Is it dark?
What seems important to these people is not determined by the amount of work it entails -- you're far from understanding the authorities if you believe that.
'Cause I look like I just got outta jail, that's why. You droppin' me off at home, right? There's a place by me.
We're both fine.
I've been better.
Yes, sir. I know.
Oh, really? Well, la-de-da!
Oh, that's right. That you really like those New York girls.
He was creepy.
Oh, I'd say so. You married-
You bet I will. And when I tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in. You fink!
Yes. I'm all over that now. Jack, hold on a minute. There's someone here who wants to talk to you...
Hello?
How long's he staying for?
He hates being confronted.
And so far my day has consisted of taking pictures of my roses for the garden club.
No! Change me back into a sor- ceress, Willow.
You are?
Truman, what about that sign?
Yeah -- being a basket case.
He gets as much as he wants.
Yes, even I had a mother. She was part Austrian, but she was still my mother. My childhood was like a tennis match; they bounced me back and forth, here and there...
How do you manage to put up with all this confusion? You always said people bore you.
You shouldn't always take me seriously. Actually, I'm used to it by now. First my mother and now my husband; both of them are like dynamos.
Oh, no, not at all. And then you know very well that he'll forgive you anything; just as long as you admit to him that you're a worse driver than he is...
Yes -- it would be nice.
It's hard to let go of a dream, isn't it? To let go of what you want?
That seems so far away from who you are now. What happened?
Really?
My childhood, instead, was a very sensible one.
What do you mean by sensible?
Those, over there, there.
Well... just meet her.
Yes.
You've got such beautiful hands.
I'm fine. Mark, I'm so glad you came over here because I want you to know something. I just thought I would tell you that I really enjoyed getting to know you this year.
Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else?
Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around.
Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway.
Doc. Ainge...
Before all these people, yes, I will marry you, Ronny Cammareri!
What!
In time, you will drop dead, and I will come to your funeral in a red dress.
Where's the ring?
I think they're going to deregulate it.
Yah?
...Touch me again and I'll kill you, you pig.
Who?
Yes.
No, you're not.
I'm going to leave you.
Is Mrs. Kane -
All right.
But you told me in the garden-- that the wish about the tree couldn't come true.
You get your wish!
You know what I wished, Daddy? I wished I could be a good girl.
But Edward, in this kind of a wish that doesn't matter.
I can make wishes like this come true. I'll be just like Daddy wants me to be -- play with the other children -- not sit around by myself tell the truth --
I've never seen a moon like that.
I don't know.
That's gone long ago. I've got to see him. Where is he?
You just want money -- and you haven't any right to any more. He made a big settlement on you.
I won't have you hounding him any more for money.
I can't stay, I just came to read my poem.
I'm here.
As opposed to this T.V.?
I want to fuck.
I thought you were watching him.
No, but... why didn't he stop it? Or did he get pleasure, watching us killing each other in his name?
Yes... yes! And now you tell me why God let all these battles happen in the first place... if he's so powerful... he said he's "the creator of heaven and earth, the source of all life..." he could have easily stopped all this blood and misery? Why didn't he?
Stop, stop... I can't remember! The battles were all so confusing... there was so much smoke, dust, noise... I was being attacked on all sides, so... maybe... perhaps I fought back but it was only to defend myself...
No! I don't want to know anymore! Leave me alone! I didn't kill that man!
Yes! We fought and killed in His name... the King of Heaven!
How you holding up?
Damn, this is sweet. We are going to be home in no time.
I'm not interested. Do what you think's best.
Those soldiers have got loafers on. What kind of army gives their soldiers loafers?
Okay.
Yeah, and Quincy, good luck with your knee, and everything.
What?
"I have more care to stay than will to go. Come death, and welcome. Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let's talk. It is not day."
Yeah?
I think we need to eat.
I really should get home...
I really should get home, I told my father... Well, I suppose a little while longer. I wonder if there's any place around here I could put some makeup on...
I think anything you want to do, you'll do well.
Miss Channing, I can't tell you how glad I am that you arrived so late.
Really, Eve? Why?
Why not?
Who fired you?
What a pity, all that fire and music being turned off...
The Big Boy did...?
You do. You're handsome and charming.
Honey, some of this is... farfetched. You take after me. People skills and common sense. Good dependable qualities.
Home?
Yes.
Who's Donna?
But my sleeping is really fucked up.
No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
Paul Lamont...?
Yes... You woke me up... It s the middle of the night here. Have you found Mr Friedman?
Daddy--
Good evening.
Are you and Mom home tonight?
Nothing, only it'd be nice to spend an evening together for a change.
Back then, he was still a DA, and quite a few parents of my patients had passed through his courtroom. You have to understand, these people were the dregs of society. But once they saw their children... he decided he would do whatever he could for them. He's that way, you know, paternal about certain things. Precrime. The precogs. You.
I can't help you. No one can. The Precogs are never wrong.
Wbat're you talking about?
What the fuck are you talking about?!
I'm sorry.
I told you, all bets are off.
Let it go.
No, forget it. The bet's off.
Okay, just so I'm clear here -- neither of you think I can do this.
You think so?
She's terribly hurt . . .
Somebody's got to help us!
I don't know, I think maybe I broke it? I knocked into something the other day...
Fuck off.
Hi, Jennifer.
There must have been somebody.
Senorita Josie.
But I don't want it straightened out.
Yes. Very clean.
No. I mean yes, he's clean but he's also other things. He's a very hard worker. Very honest. Very caring. Gentle. Good father.
Hello, Rick.
-- This is Mr. Laszlo.
Much.
So...how's the knee?
Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip.
In a minute, Robert - in a minute... Chauncey, I would like to ask a favor of you...
Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve?
Just slipped your mind.
Was she that bad?
Yes.
Yes, desperately.
Boy is he excited about the game tomorrow.
Certainly. Now there's the principal actor in our little play.
Nothing. I just wondered. No reason to take it up with him. "--about a quarter of a mile on either side of Willet Creek--"
No, I haven't. I guess I thought the name was familiar. By the way, you discussed with Senator Paine where the camp was to be situated and everything?
Sit tight, Diz. The show commences in just a minute.
That's what I'm going to do. I'm going to go home. I quit. Laurie, I quit. I'm going back to Baltimore. How does a blonde do a high- five?
You speak so many bloody languages and you never want to talk.
Do you think I could have some water?
Tired?
A wasted day.
He's allergic to everything.
Chocolate?
Simon, next door, the Charingas' boy.
Shut up, Will.
I can't find him. I've tried everything. I thought you might know.
Huh?
Com'on, Travis. It's not that bad. I take lots of taxis.
You're right! Now I remember! It was after the Western regional planners were in town and the meeting went late. The next day I was completely bushed. It was unbelievable.
Three in the morning? I don't think so. I have to go to bed early. I work days. It must have been somebody else.
Am I right?
But...
But Irena is in the garden. She's right there, under the tree.
Don't you see her?...Right there, under the tree.
She's there, just like I said she'd be.
You've gotta get outta here.
It's a secret. I can't even tell you, my dear. I've got an important idea to work on.
Everyone's all right...?
I'm all right.
Tommy...!
So.
Father, I have nowhere else to stay.
Yes, shit. Oops, sorry! Sorry. It's just I told myself I wasn't going to say Pope Alexander and sound like a dope and then I go ahead and do it. Like I psyched myself out.
Okay, um, there's one that goes "Blessed are the forgetful, for they get the better even of their blunders."
Oh, um, like famous quotes. I find reading them inspirational to me. And in my reading I've come across some I thought you might like, too.
There's another one I like, I read. It's by Pope Alexander.
Yeah, yeah it is, Howard. And here I was thinking I could tell you something you didn't know.
You're just come in --
There's no disturbance.
No. No, I'm all right. Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell! I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here!
We run that twenty-odd years. Give it over to Otis Payne in 1967. April.
Is that a blessing, Reverend?
What is it, David Lee?
It's a shame, Reverend. It's a damn shame.
Yeah, he'll crawl into my bed tonight, lie close to my body and keep me warm -- and rectify the evil in the men who live over us in this valley.
Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you?
About what?
Oh... Now she's starting. How do they know?
Will you be friend for always?
I can't understand why you let those people go in there, sir.
Watery headed bunch.
Excuse me, sir. I'd like to have a word with you.
I'm Ann Millaney's sister.
I can call back...
You didn't have to get off the other line. I would've called you back.
I've wanted a friend too. I've been lonely.
Slides go with it.
You wouldn't understand. Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think?
Where?
You didn't think someone from your office would call and tell me you wrecked the entire building and threatened people with a baseball bat?!
What did you do with your dog?
Where have you been for a week?!
But you can't call me while you think?
No. No, you're not hurting me. But I think you better quit it.
You're about to become the anti-Christ who is born unholy and becomes the door to eternal suffering in this world.
In any case, I don't suppose the salary you make sewing mailbags is really commensurate with international airline travel.
I don't like the word 'cheat.'
It'd have to be Switzerland to make sure Dwayne never finds us.
That which has been hidden in darkness is now in the light. This bucket of blood.
I got an awful toothache.
I don't know about that. Oh, no, I just, see, I-I've been very, very lucky. W-when I had the kids, I decided to stop working and just, you know, devote myself to having the family, and I've been very, very happy but...I've always secretly hoped that maybe some little gem would come along and tempt me back on the stage...
I just wanted to get past this quot;old school Marm quot; image.
what I mean?
Well, I mean, I meet a lot of... jerks, you know-
I know.
Oh... nothing. Not-no, no!
But I'm thinking about getting some cats, you know, and then they... Oh, wait a second-oh, no, no, I mean oh, shoot! No, Saturday night I'm gonna- gonna sing. Yeah.
Harry? I was just wondering, if there is anything wrong with Vada.
You ain't gettin' in no trouble, I hope.
Oh bullshit.
Well, the cumulative effect is not good, let me tell you. I knew I shouldn't have watered those plants.
Well the other night at dinner...
I am?
We mostly publish trashy romance novels.
They found an eyelash.
Friend?
Sure. In between all the other things I have to do.
You're your own baby.
Who is it?
You mean babies with you?
It looks done.
Staten Island would be ok.
Could you please put my glass on the table?
Too bad. He called me up today, can you believe that? I don't know how he got my number. He asks me do I want to come over and see him, I tell him I'd rather go to a leper colony. He says there's a new gang that wants to kill him, take over the business. I told him I hope he's right. That they kill him. That's what I told him.
I heard CY Coates was brought in. He looked pretty bad.
By your Austrian?
Honey, go back to sleep, please!
Jim, what is going on, for heaven's sake! You going to stay up all night every night? For what? So you'll be the only man in America who read the entire 26 volumes of the Warren Report?
What makes you think we're more interesting?
Oh.
Is that the mail?
It's what my whole life's been... aimed at; the only thing that's given it a sense of purpose.
In other words.
If you came back.
Something like that.
She's awake.
Norman Spencer.
No life signs at all. He's a turnip.
Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure.
You're too good for the small-time, Roy. Move up to where there's big dough to be made, and you don't have to stick your neck out every day.
No! Because I --
What?
For Christ's sake, why not?
Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address.
I was with somebody.
I didn't know you were coming.
W-w-we-we've decided after a lot of discussion that we-we'd try with artificial insemination.
BULLSHIT. BULLSHIT HE DIDN'T ASK YOU, HE DOESN'T WANT HIM, HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM, SO FUCK YOU THAT HE ASKED THAT. THERE IS NO ONE BUT ME AND HIM.
Great?
Oh my God! America told me your neighbors are coming?
I don't know how to run a newspaper, Mr. Thatcher. I just try everything I can think of.
I never put myself in harm's way.
Do you like putting makeup on people?
I think that we should stop going out on dates.
An on-site monitoring well? That means --
It was right up on the PG E property over there.
Ross -- you are an absolute angel.
And learn about charity and justice and all the other things people would rather talk about than practice? Pop goes up to her and holds out his two arms, his right one closer to Edie; he trembles with emotion.
He tries to act tough, but there's a look in his eyes that... .
He wasn't Abyssinian, Pop, Assyrian... .
Yes, every day. Maybe I shouldn't have worn that dress? I told Beth it was a bad idea. That's why they made me Queen.
I'm sure they'll notice things missing.
Pop, don't think I'm not feeling grateful for all you've done to get me an education and shelter me from this. But now my eyes are open. I see things I know are so wrong how can I go back and keep my mind on things that are only in books and that people aren't living? I'm staying, Pop. And I'm going to keep on trying to find out who's guilty for Joey. I'd walk home with a dozen Terry Malloys if I thought they could help me. I tell you I'm staying, Pop. Pop starts to pull his belt out of his trousers.
That's just perfect isn't it? Did it work? Did you find out why I came back?
Maybe I can help you find him. I know a lot of people.
Because I'm at the edge of my capabilities, Robert.
Just in time, too.
Terrific. Going on alot of dates ... seeing lots of men... lots of dates..
Well, if you don't go, I guess I'll see you.
Jack.
Well, this is some surprise. Hey ... You don't look so good, pal.
Let me get the light.
If Walter Burns calls, hold the wire for me, will you? I'll be right back.
No -- what?
Yeah. To go to school and, you know, paint, performances, paint.
Hi.
Artsy little village down seven. There's a guy there who sells my work. I had just dropped off some paintings and as I got in my car...I saw Norman sitting at this little cafe.
Adamant?
By the time I finally got up the nerve to tell you, Stan called from the hospital and it was too late.
I had just been left by Richard. I was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.
Relieved?
Partly because I didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because I was relieved.
PG -- Are you sure?
What's going on in there?
I don't know.
The nanobot.
... just like the mouse.
It escaped from the lab before we could finish the experiment.
As I said I have some j-j-j-j- that I might wish t-t-to sell and I wanted an estimate--
Thank you -- b-b-but I'd really like t-t-to--
Thank you-
That. And less strange.
You're the pathetic one, not me.
I'm not.
Yes.
I hope they do.
Whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. This ain't solvin' my problem. I gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. I'm off today, but if I can't leave the country I'm out of a job. And if I don't got a job, I can't hire a lawyer.
Hello again, neighbour. I didn t intrude, did I?
Must be your lucky day then. I ve got your accounts - you don t owe much tax for last year.
It's been the same one for three months.
Yes. But my boss reckons you d still be better off as a limited company. For expenses and all that, you know? It d cost you about 100 but he said it d be worth it. Of course, you d need a partner to register. But that s a formality. I mean, I could be your partner. I mean, just as a name, right?
Hurry!
You need a good review and you'll be fine. The whole color of the world will change, mark my words.
I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan. But I think you're really nice people...
There's only you, Ryan. You know what, Ryan? You're beautiful. I love you so much... You need...
I think you should then. You should look in on Sheila.
They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us...
That's not...It's not like that.
You will not say one single word. I know your secret.
What would I be thinking?
You were father's secretary - I never thought - -
What if he is?
Are they ready yet?
Say, all wars have innocent victims.
Oh!
Oh, I'm sorry... Didn't I say, "what?" I thought I said, "what?"... What?
No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
I also wrote one part... I wrote I'm sorry... I was talking about I was sorry when I got mad at you when you came over and you told my son that he ought to answer back so I wrote that. I was sorry for busting you on that... and I'm sorry for busting in on you that night... when I said I was never... I was sorry and I'm sorry every time your food was cold and that you had to wait two seconds for a coffee filler...
There's another choice.
What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
Aquittal.
What?
Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
How?
Answers.
All right, what do you need.
What's that man's name?
Give me his name, I will mail him.
You wanted to share this moment with me.
All right, Amy. Go tell Edward to take you.
But it won't be Christmas tomorrow.
No. I only let her go with Edward. It's alright.
You're right.
Yeah.
The man we know and love.
No, Alex, we don't really love you.
She does. From when you were a boy.
Shrink major, not a shrink.
I can see that. Pardon me for saying so, but you look like shit. What happened?
I'm not so sure I can say the same thing...You don't look like a cop.
Who the hell are you?
Well when can we do something?
And you like them?
Were you always funny?
Now, then comes the drama. He meets discouragement. He finds the world has feet of clay. His ideals crumble. So what does he do? He decides to commit suicide in protest against the state of civilization. He thinks of the river! But no, no, he has a better idea. The City Hall. Why? Because he wants to attract attention. He wants to get a few things off his chest, and that's the only way he can get himself heard.
John Doe.
Well, the whole town's curious about John Doe and, boom, just like that you're going to bury him. There's enough circulation in that man to start a shortage in the ink market!
Sure! When you get hold of a stunt that sells papers you don't drop it like a hot potato. Why, this is good for at least a couple of months. You know what I'd do? Between now and let's say, Christmas, when he's gonna jump, I'd run a daily yarn starting with his boyhood, his schooling, his first job! A wide-eyed youngster facing a chaotic world. The problem of the average man, of all the John Does in the world.
Our John Doe! The one I made up! Look, genius Now, look. Suppose there was a John Doe and he walked into this office. What would you do? Find him a job and forget about the whole business, I suppose! Not me! I'd have made a deal with him!
What kind of person lives like this? Huh? What kind of person lets her kids run around in a house crawling with bugs the size of housecats?
Why?
I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
Well, I don't know for sure... he's a hairdresser.
Maybe... why do you ask?
They'll be pretty rough with you....with your record.
Yes, but... I thought...
Would it be too much trouble, sir, to ask you to look at them now? While I wait.
He's terribly busy, sir.
That's right, Your Excellency. I've come on behalf of my hus band. I'm - I'm bringing some samples of his work so he can be considered for the royal appointment.
No, I will. I don't want to leave something out because I know I can say anything to you. You're a liar, and a thief.
It's you, Norman. Your fear of drowning. You have to face it.
I know. Women Now, I guess. The commercial says they help women now.
Well, are you going to go to Havenbrooke or Women Now for the abortion? You need a note from your parents for Havenbrooke.
Want me to call for you? I called for Becky last year.
Unfortunately, yes.
That's the kind of emotion I was looking for in the first take.
Oh my God! Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!
That is sick, man.
Heavy lifting can only help you at this point.
I feel like shit. Me and my frigging nosebleeds.
You'd be surprised how many kinds of birds you'll see here. Last week I saw a purple martin. And the week before that, I saw a solitary vireo. That's rare.
You're right.
I might do it wrong.
Doing what?
There are more on the other side.
It'll come back, Daddy.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
What kind of light?
That's just --
Who is that?
I think you're crazy. Don't look over, it's Lenny Silverman.
Oh, it's nothing... I better go, I'll talk to you later.
Ok, bye.
Yeah.
Do you think it's done?
What was I supposed to do?
Laura, I am your friend.
I can't remember anything about last night. Is there something I should remember?
There's worse things.
Another young man.
He refuses to be seen in my company! He blanches at the mention of your name --
What! After giving us such a run around...
If I had a man waiting for me for half an hour and whom I hadn't seen for a month ...
But where are you going?
I have to go back tonight. At eight Exactly.
Don't crowd me, Craig.
You sure?
Is it this aisle, Lou-is?
Okay, you got it. Just take a chill pill, for christ sake.
That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks.
What's the use, there ain't none.
Okay. Okay. I'll bet there's...Look at this.
Where is she then?
I didn't do that.
See?
To let it dry.
He hung it up.
What?
Yeah.
Then what? Exactly.
Duff, I love you.
You said he washed the money?
The Navy Cross...
Benjamin --
How can you put this on my shoulders?
I love the smell of pine.
Ginny Danburry's here. Look for her.
Now you listen to me Calvin Webber, when this baby comes, you're going to be out in the waiting room smoking yourself to death with all the other fathers.
As long as we've got that straight.
To you maybe.
It's been ages since I've even thought of a mummers' play. When I was in college we used to do them every year St. George and the Dragon, all kinds of sword dances.
You really enjoy my company?
I like you, too, Nathan.
Yeah But I have some peculiarities also.
Viktor, I have a feeling. One of my feelings. There's something about her I don't trust.
That means I don't run Nirdlinger's!
Oh, God. Back it, Bobbie -- Bobbie?
Nine seconds.
What's going on ?
What makes you know so much? How do you know what Eddie was thinking?
You didn't really see the space ship. You just thought you did.
Now think back hard. You didn't follow Mr. Carpenter at all, did you? You haven't even been out of the house.
It's all right, Eddie. I'm sure Mr. Gordon meant no offense. It was a figure of speech.
I'm going to visit my sister for a few days. I'd like you to get your stuff out.
He'll live through it. They all live through it. What a world, huh?
Well, I guess I do. For a long time I was too focused on my work, I think, but now I've really begun to think about changing myself, you know, developing, and...growing.
No, not really.
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?
Well, I'd like to travel. And maybe go back to school, but I really don't know...I'm at a point in my life where there seems lo be a lot of possibilities, but I'm so... I don't know...unsure.
Yeah, then we'd be stuck here.
I'm serious.
-- he's so strange I don't know if you really even would want to go out with him, someone like him, I said I'd try, but it's just --
It's not bad, it's ok.
It was going too fast.
It's ok, it's alright. I'll come right back, I'll just go pay for my car.
God dammit! How'm I gonna got out of here?
That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
Do you think I should have stayed? Don't you think maybe I should have stayed? I've been a jerk, right? I should have stayed! I was supposed to be in love... I was in love! I am in love, why did I act like a bitch? He went swimming. All the man did was go swimming! I must be crazy. It was too good to be true.
Vitamins, exercise, herb tea... and see a doctor, will ya?
I know, I know! I'm a terrible person... It's... I'm so damn, damn sad.
I think you'll do very well.
You know, Adele penguins pick one mate. They spend their whole life looking for that one other penguin and when they find it, they know. That's the penguin they stay with for the rest of their lives.
Wow. That's big. I mean sex is a really big deal. You shouldn't do it until you know you've found the right person.
You want the rest of those numbers, Mr. Dickson?
How do you know I'm so poisonous? Like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?
Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
No way. No, I definitely don't want to know.
Aw, please Junebug?
Until he's old enough to read.
What did you do with her?
Expect so.
Your brother? What you talking about?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Richard! You should be ashamed of yourself.
Fuck you! Do you hear me, John!? Fuck you! John . . . John!?
You will?
Thank God. I got to see you. Grown up.
Can I ask you a question? People always say, you gotta get good with Jesus, if you want not to go to hell. That you say sorry for all you done and... and Jesus would let you go on to heaven.
Will champagne help?
Panes is here!
I don't want to say goodbye.
You're sweet, but the only thing that you can do for me is to go.
Who said anything about love?
Stop kidding me! Four years in a town like Los Ang-gleez, and a peanut selling job is the best you can do? You expect me to believe that?
Just a little accident. I went by your place, picked up your mall. Just bills, I'll take care of them.
Whatever you say. The manager says your boss called. Really pulled the wool over everybody's eyes, huh?
Get well soon.
I'll see you when you get home.
I don't know. If it was a god, it was searching for a greater one. It was still searching for meaning...
I'm not sure... Maybe it simply exists in the search for it. Maybe its something we have to make for ourselves.
... but it is a good question, and I suppose I'll always wonder about the answer: Why would they send me back without proof?
In other words, God works in mysterious ways...
Something my dad -- they -- said. 'After all the suffering, after all the desolation of the void -- the one thing that makes the vastness tolerable is each other.' The one thing that makes it bearable is love.
My boyfriend told me about you.
Can't you talk to him? Maybe talk him into it. I'm a real good interviewer. Just get me in the room with him.
I shouldn't have asked you to come.
No, I'll be fine. I'm just visiting a sick friend.
If I'm not back in fifteen minutes, hit the buzzer. That way she'll let me go.
On... Once... Once... What are we... you going to do?
They found his body yesterday. In the pool at our house in Sao Paulo. He drowned. Drank too much, went for a swim and drowned.
The staff don t know yet... I called my parents, told them everything... I just couldn t take any more...
Mine.
Yeah, I hope you have, too. MICKEY I hope so for your sake, because, uh, your personality left something to be desired...
I don t know. Everyone s dead...
You're going to be very busy these days aren't you?
We're gonna call it California sinsemilla. Sounds exotic.
That.
Yes, dear, I know.
My ex-husband. My work drove him away. Made his life a misery. He thinks I m obsessed, punishing myself for what happened to our son. But he s a good guy. He ll listen to you. He won t turn you in if I ask him not to. I can pretty much guarantee that. Okay?
In English. I'll fuck your brains out.
I don't know.
What business?
Oh, I'm sure it will!
Thank you.
Ok.
Thank you.
Adam? Don't even think about it. Okay? I'm sorry. I know that sounds mean, but believe me, it would be meaner if I didn't say it. Okay?
Now, let's take the truck back and get something to eat.
Name it.
Yeah, it was.
Here we go...
Eli is a fine carpenter. Best in the district. He and his father built the big house themselves forty years ago.
Stephen, I'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?
My car, not yours. Yours is a complete wreck. The police dragged it to the pound behind the station.
The sergeant asked me to identify it. He didn't believe you'd gotten out alive.
Outside in the visitors, car park.
It is?
People change...you know.
I wanta get some things.
Sure.
No -- he's lying.
Don't listen to him. Can't you see he's trying to turn you against me.
Shoot him.
I thought you were just shy, but now I think it's something else.
Yeah, they could.
So... what's your dark secret?
Yeah.
Maybe I'll tell you later.
Not if you don't grow up...
Boy, this is really a nice screening room. It's really a nice room.
Oh, yes, I do, Joe. Believe me. You say you're going to lose. Is it my fault? Listen! The damned case doesn't start until tomorrow and already it's over for you!
What is your wife's picture doing by the side of your...
You're leaving right now?
There you are! My God, darling, I've been so worried. Are you alright?
Yes.
Well...How have you been?
Or course. You should come over to the house. The boys would love to meet you.
I don't know who I am! I still don't know!
I've spent my whole life waiting to find you ...
I can just feel my spirits soar.
It's all taken care of. It's all paid for.
Jesus...
I don't know why you should be so upset. Stop that playing, Max. It seemed like a good idea -- if we are to work together.
You ready to eat?
You'll like it here.
That's nice Ben.
quot;In the great green room there was a telephone and a red balloon... quot;
Uh...
Ben! What's wrong?
To make it easier for them or you?
You weren't disappointed in her, then.
Every Tuesday except the 3rd Tuesday of the month when it's switched to Friday except in April when she rides on Thursday. It's not that hard. Didn't you have a mother?
She was happy here. However the two of you might have parted. Don't think she wasn't.
Carl restored my confidence. He really did. He's much more substantial than you give him credit for.
It's a free country, you can think anything you want.
Yeah.
I can't... not yet...
I'm sorry.
I hate it here. It's so ugly, it's like being dead. You got out of here, you know? I'm ready to go.
Why, because I'm a freak and you are beautiful, and you are being nice enough to come down to my freak, nonbeautiful level and act concerned about my repulsive troubles?
How is that helping, Natalie? How exactly?
Yeah, Natalie. It's hair. It grows.
It's embarrassing, okay?
No, I know that part --
Oh god, Laura.
Oh, come on, sweetie, give me one of your smiles.
You're telling me, but only because you never let me in on any of it... you're not going to see Bobby, are you?
Why are you suddenly so interested in who I am going to see at night? Nighttime is my time.
Are you going to see James tonight?
Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
Where you been?
I don't wanna talk about it.
Hi.
Alright.
I know.
Intravenous administration complete.
Why not?
You saw a MiG 21?
Where did you see that?
It's what?
Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off him was his clothes!
You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
What are you so crazy about the movies for?
I have to tell you something...
We didn't know what to think. You were so weird yesterday, and then this morning, we go to the bank and no bag.
Inside the Precog who predicted it. All you have to do is download it.
Do you know who that is?
Was she one of your teachers?
What were you dreaming about?
Hi. How are you feeling?
You really think so?
Oh. I can type up a storm, but I can't spell. So they gave me a pair of white gloves and stuck me in an elevator -- that's how I met Jeff -- Oh, God, I'm so fouled up. What am I going to do now?
Was he really upset when you told him?
We'll see.
Well, God damn it, Matthew -- Randy's mom doesn't work eighteen-hour days, and Randy's dad didn't leave her, so figuring out who's gonna take who where is a little easier over at Randy's house.
I want my paycheck. By the end of the day.
You might want to think real hard about the amount, too. My kids are sitting in the God damn parking lot right now, cause I still don't make enough to afford good child care. Makes me think about looking around for a job where I'm appreciated, for shit's sake.
Hey.
Fine.
I thought you were going to let this one through.
Her name is Felicity, and she just turned eighteen. She ran away from Pittsburgh last year, and now she's living in some shit-hole here in Brooklyn with a guy named Chico. Strung out on crack, four months pregnant. I can't bear to think about that baby. Our grandchild, Auggie. Just think of it. Our grandchild.
Yeah.
Shit. I'm gettin' tired.
Are you alright?
And I don't want any more Wild Turkey, either. It's burning a hole in my stomach.
Okay, okay... I've got some tequila. You want some tequila?
You do?
Yeah, you want it?
I think I've really fucked up. I think I've got us in a situation where we could both get killed. Why didn't we just go straight to the police.
You know why. You already said.
It's Lynn.
I don't know. I never heard of the Nite Owl till today.
Like I said we were friendly, not friends.
Pierce meets people. Sue came on the bus with dreams of Hollywood. This is how they turned out. Thanks to Pierce, we still get to act a little.
He's waiting for you to mention mention.
I've got an even hotter story -- The Sap from the City Desk.
You're coming back?
You can't do that! You came here to turn the crowd around not make them hate you.
Why don't you like me?
What do you want?
I don't know.
That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me?
...You got no cause to hurt me.
You gave your word?
What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither.
...I need to sit down.
Father, please don't die.
...a Turner, a perfect canary diaiaond... a Lear jet... world peace... the best of everything...
I don't.
Am I? Or am I making so much sense that you're going insane?
You have modest wants. I like that in a man.
See ya around.
Unless she has nerve.
Did you like it, dear?
He cried.
He knows you shattered his violin.
That's his, I don't know, his 'grounding' phrase for me, "together, no matter what."
Two hundred years old.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes. Tell me about the day you got off the train.
Tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. Not near ready. Not by the longest shot. Aaron's spent six weeks in Tripoli, he's interviewed Gaddafi -- he reported on the Eight-one story. I think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and I think it's my responsibility to tell you that.
Say again, sir?
We got to, Tommy. But that's gonna be awright. I seen the han'bills, about how much work they is, an' high wages, too. But I gotta fin' out somepin' else first, Tommy. Did they hurt you, son? Did they hurt you an' make you mean-mad?
Chief, sir, I don't understand why --
I was so scared we was goin' away without you--and we'd never see each other again.
No kidding?
I don't see why we have to take the train.
Big spender.
What if we want to drive somewhere while we're there?
Uh ... I mean you're on right after this act.
Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
What?
One, up.
That's very serious. Who's her doctor?
Gee, that's very serious...
The kid is on. You've got me listening to this garbage. Go on, turn it on.
Yes.
I'm a practical woman Mr. Dulaney. Killing Andrew wasn't in my best interest. As it is I'm out of a job and I'm not in his will.
I was jealous. Of course I was hurt. He switched me off like a little toy he was finished playing with. But I didn't kill him.
Basquiat, what did you take?
You're blaming me? I had to go see my family.
It's Monday morning.
Oh, God, Basquiat, you scared the shit out of me. How the fuck could you do that to yourself?
I don't care what he says! We have to do something, Robert! I can't sit here and trust everything's going to work out just by pretending it will.
How's that?
Okay, okay! Take it easy!
Perry?
What is it?!
Mind if I change the station? Better traffic reports on AM.
10,000 a year to the girl for as long as she looks after the boy?
Probably.
Uh-huh.
Not much -- you?
How do you know?
They got the new T.V.
My name's Lydia. And it seems you and I have a lot in common.
To set the record straight about where he was the other night when he said he was working late.
A friend of your fiance's.
It's there.
Are you asleep?
I'd like that.
Yeah. I want you to have this picture, so you won't forget what I look like. And so you'll remember to call me over the summer.
They're going to send detectives.
George... how about Felicia?
I can still use a gun.
So how'd it go?
For how long?
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Oh?
...so accomplished.
I don't know, I have nothing to compare it to. I guess I thought there was something more to it.
I don't know... I think I missed something.
Nobody is freer than when he dreams. I read that.
I'm not sure. Is there a secret?
There was nothing to know. Anyway... if I can't have love I have to at least have money. I have to have some pride I can do something.
Okay.
That's not it.
Oh, yes. The superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.
I'm angry because I want a mother, not Martha Stewart.
So you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?
Because you're pushing me to be something I'm not.
What was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things I knew could help you?
So?
-- you'll be the prettiest thing in the room -- light's green...
Richard, Victor thinks I'm leaving with him. Haven't you told him?
Walter.
I do.
We'll move them --
It's probably just the flowers --
What was that?
Where is it?
Why? what is it? Why did you make me wait out here?
I don't remember... Anyway, Andy's okay...
It was a long time ago... I met him at this place called Moke's... We... became friends... He told me about a job...
It's all right.
But tonight is Christmas Eve!
Was there?
Tolerable well.
You sure you can manage?
Don't bend back like that.
Don't I know you?
Worried! I was petrified. Weren't you?
Sure. You shouted at me in the auditorium when I read my essay.
I know him too.
Yes.
Work hard, be good at your job. Sir. Do whatever they tell you.
But why?
Something witty and devastating like that.
I don't mind.
She's upstairs.. .the lady who lives up there.
We loved each other once. Have you forgotten that?
I don't want to go to jail for this.
Why's that taxi driver across the street been staring at us?
Have you been noticing anything strange?
I don't know -- but it feels like a long time.
That taxi driver. The one that's been sitting here.
Please. Go. Just go.
Don't! Just let go.
I said, NO! ... I've read like one book in my whole life and I'll be damned if I let you throw it on that fire ...
It's okay, just leave it.
Professor Tripp.
I got the message you called.
I think so... What about you?
Just checking.
No.
He'll file. He's an ambitious man. Ambitious men build their careers on the bodies of others.
And that's exactly what the jury will see when they look at me. That's why I need a very good lawyer, Mr. Dulaney.
John Levy, Staff, and Amy Cain, Press Off....
How can Cardenas possibly think he can build a case against two consenting adults?
When it broke, he said one word: get me Ronnie Brean.
I don't know. I barely made it today.
Even if you don't think it's real?
What would you do?
No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite.
Hmm? Is that a professional opinion?
Fuck Kurt.
Why not?
I want a divorce.
Not that. Us.
Satisfied? Now get out. Out.
He didn't give me a chance. Look, honey, don't get upset, but he's not taking your case.
I'm calling for your brother Johnny. He's getting married and he wants you to come.
How can anyone be that naive?
What?
I don't know. That's all he said. He wasn't very friendly. Oh, yeah. He said your buddies backed down. They chickened out, he said.
Baby, I'm sorry. I feel terrible. I'd stay and talk but I'm so late. Look, don't be upset. We'll talk when I get home. See you around midnight. Bye. And don't brood. Watch T.V. or something.
I used to know how to cook.
What?
What's to be jealous of?
Not so famous any of us have ever heard of him.
Right, and at this rate it ends its run in...
Really, I have no problem with --
None at this time, sir.
Sir, I just want you to know... I'm not here to make a statement. I don't want to make men look foolish. All I care about is completing the training and getting operational experience -- just like everyone else, I suspect.
You and Mom have a lawyer?
Who's Mr. Stephens?
No. What's this lawyer business?
My lawyer? Why do I need a lawyer?
Same as everyone else.
Book five, Deuteronomy, chapter seven, verse five. "But this shall you deal with them. You shall break down their altars and burn their graven images with fire."
Yes.
Sorry?
I'm not going to stay long; I can't.
I think it's too late for changes, Michael. I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it.
Tell me, Michael. What really happened with Pentangeli?
I didn't even know he had a brother. And where is he now?
And that's all he had to do. Just show his face.
It's okay, Mike - Should we get together another time, ya think?
Just which Constitutional amendment protects our right to peddle PCP?
I'm kicking myself, Eddie... Right out of here.
Well, I always liked you, Mike.
...He doesn't get invited places.
I've been trying to reach you all afternoon. You weren't in the shop. What is this thing tonight?
I have to have Jackie ask me? Don't you think you could call me and let me know? Look at my hair.
Never mind. Where've you been?
What business meeting?
Sure.
She's on her way. With half the men in the joint. It's only a fur coat...
What did you expect - live sables?
A diamond collar, gold sleeves - you know, picture people...
Bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here-
I won't forget.
I seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't I?
He wouldn't say.
Yah, I think that vehicle there probly had dealer plates. DLR?
Remember that.
I know.
I probably am, but I don't care. I mean, I wasn't that blessed to begin with, and when would I have had time to make any improvements...
Don't be afraid of him none. I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together.
He didn't do anything. He just told me his theory... It's sad when patients get like that. They loose reality.
Be careful? You mean you - or me? Who?
So will you, someday.
Here it is.
It was busy.
I wish you'd get an answering machine.
It does not.
It looks like a tablecloth.
It's a sun dress.
What is it?
I can't. I've got a kid. She lives with my parents. Quincey knows where they live.
I'll just boost the doses.
No, no ... we wouldn't do it.
How long does it last?
Lester, don't you think that uhh --
How fast does it take effect?
He doesn't know what's going on. Leave him alone.
Where are we going?
Then how did he --
Oh, no...
That's...
That's what you told me two days ago!
Would you mind?
Yes! But I...I have certain feelings for you, but don't make me say anything more, all right?
Poor Hannah.
I can't say anything!
Why?
Why not?
Fixing it? But I fixed -- Where'd you get all that?
Wait a second --
None of this was here before.
Sam, that old woman, whoever she is. I think she told Arbogast something! And I want her to tell us the same thing!
He's always got it bad as long as I'm running in the other direction. Don't be fooled, he's no different than any other guy. He knows how to chase and that's it. Once he's caught you, he don't know what to do. So he runs away.
I don't care what you say about him. The boy has got it bad.
I heard that.
Nothing. I'm not gonna tell him a thing. The least I can do is not make him an accessory any more than he already is.
So what are you gonna tell him?
I didn't ask him to come! It's like I said, Thelma, he just loves the chase.
You are so sweet to that guy, you really are. Imagine not wanting to drag him into this. He is a lucky man.
Put a lid on it, Thelma! It's hard enough as it is. Just let me get this part over with. Now stay here and guard the money. If there's any problem I'm in room 115.
Well boy, he's got his work cut out for him now, don't he?
Don't you think she does?
At least she isn't drinking. Did you notice?
Mm-hm.
Doesn't she look great in that new dress?
Yeah.
Ohh?
Uh-oh.
Yeah, Mom's Camille when she gets up in the morning.
You're a stupid, fat arsed, obstructive, fascist moron aren't you?
No. No, you definitely cannot do that, Mark. That's a big, fat sack of no!
What?
No.
Only squares and nerds go to dances.
I don't know.
Mom, we already...
You buckled up? You cold?
You're really never going to make love again?
They loved you. I told you they would love you and they did.
No, you shouldn't have, it was needlessly cruel. She thinks she has cancer and is going to die.
Well, that's pathetic. Poor Rose, what a life she has had.
Gonorrhea?
...We know so little about each other.
Do you think you could discreetly move across the hall now?
I wanted to let his family know....
Benjamin. That's supposed to explain it?
You're insane.
Do you still want to go to that thing tonight?
Until you came along we were going to Sonora.
I can't afford stuff like this right now.
I'm sick of waiting - we need to start getting stuff if we're ever going to move. Aren't these the greatest towels?
No matter what happened it would be a big disaster... Let's just try and keep everything the way it is.
Look, we have to get these...
I can't imagine spending money on towels.
You don't have to. I'll pay for all the stuff right now and you can pay me back when you finally get a job.
Why do you care about this kind of stuff?
Don't you want nice stuff?
Yes, I know.
I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada. Also, the children - Michael, they're here.
Bye Dad, I'll miss you.
That's not true.
How about this?
I am not letting you out of the house in that, young lady.
Now this is cute.
Yes, I know.
I have some change!
Why are you going here? What is here?
On his back, I suppose.
I learned a lot of things in college. Actually--it was Norbert who told me that.
Well, let's see now - not counting tonight ... must be about twenty-eight times.
Not bad...I shoulda warned you. Dad always does something really special for their anniversary.
Watch me do what?
I don't have any time to see you now. I'm doing grand rounds and then I'm examining back-to-back patients until dinner and then --
Then why are you here, Joe?
Joe --
Well then that's not exactly dating is it.
Fuck you, George. I knew you'd say something like that. Always thinking about yourself.
What are you doing here?
Well, here I am. See?
George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
Well then what are you trying to do-
Yes, but I can't love a man named Wally.
Do you like the way I look?
Would you like me to take my pants off?
Then get those balls in the air and get your butt over here.
My parents had a brief, but intensely fulfilling relationship. She's remained a woman of mystery to this day.
I was thinking a graphic designer, mid-thirties, and his cool Asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. But I'm trying to not be too particular.
That's okay. I'm probably, you know, busy.
-- very nice, very nice.
No kidding.
We were just dancing--
It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery.
What's wrong?
Sam! No!
I'm a professional. You guys are in my line of work.
You're going to kill me.
Caesar, someone could see us out here.
... thank you.
No.
Because I don't want you to.
That's enough.
Don't talk about Elaine.
Four years?
You couldn't have known --
Are you out of your mind?
More! More!
I can't. I'm too embarrassed.
Don't say that...
Charlie...
You didn't transform them, Willow, you released them. That was noth- ing. Now change me.
Yeah. Come on Charlie, turn it off.
Yeah, for some reason, I'm sure...
Yes.
At you? Polly want a kiss?
Don't be so modest, Ben. It's a job that requires a certain prescience with regards to entertainment trends. You were the first to predict that Billy Jack would be a hit --
I'll be there.
Could I ask you a question?
Last night in this very restaurant Mr. Jason Hoag paid a very pretty compliment to my right ear.
Did I use the term "sexual conquests" or is that your way of putting it.
Says you were closed off, non communicative, never told me what you were feeling.
A bully? Moi?
Well?
I understand perfectly.
Well -- you want me?
Well?
Wait -- I must figure it up. First, I'll need -- clothes -- shoes -- it's cold in England in March, I'll need a suit... You'd want me to look nice?
Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
John?
She never mentioned her father.
I'm not. We...we met at a party.
He's very intense, and internal, don't you think?
Yes, he is different... Not the kind of person one usually meets in Washington.
Good. It might be pleasant for a couple of days. ... Robert... Is there any improvement...?
But now you don't have to--
Better'n new, cause it's got a story. Want to do the other part?
I don't even want to imagine the things you've seen...
We don't need your help we're doing great on our own.
Let him trust Quintus.
Mr. Webster, you mustn't believe all that people say.
You see, I don't care if we are rich or poor -- I don't care if we're big or small, all I care about is Jabez. He was the first man I loved. He never used to care about money -- we were poor as Job's turkey, but none of us minded. Now I've seen him drive the poor from the door, and we used to be poor ourselves. I've seen him get hard and mean, and he isn't hard or mean. I've heard him mock at the church bells -- the bells that rang for our wedding. That's not like him, Mr. Webster -- It must be my fault somehow -- my fault.
Sorry, honey... I'll be right there.
That's it, then I'm leaving.
Not really.
It's not to wear around, or any- thing, I'm way too young. It's just for play.
See, I...
It's okay, it's twenty minutes. The horse'll be there.
Wow. Who's that for?
I guess.
I got a call from my firm this morning saying don't come in.
Yes.
There are reporters wanting to know about my relationship with you and how long I've worked for the mob. The mob, Bobby!
Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
Are you going to stiff me?
I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
Pull out your cock.
I've got to finish this chapter anyway.
Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
You know I did baby... And a deep, dark one at that. Now if you ain't a dog, which you don't look like --
-- good, then all you got to be is grateful.
You love her?
What've you got?
I'm all right.
We could hardly say no.
"Before what?"
"Stop! Just Stop! That's what you said from the beginning. If I tell what happened... they'll arrest you and put you in jail, so get out of here before..."
Yeah well, you said you were busy... look, I'd better get going... I'll call you tomorrow.
I don't believe you.
Just some people from work...
What are you talking about? Who?
Actually, I'm just about to go out with some friends...
So should I come over?
How repulsive!
I can't believe it - he actually scored!
What happened to Seymour?
Something soft.
Let me guess: Another short circuit?
Sally?
Hi. Monica and Ryan?
You forgot this.
That's God's way!
Yes. And you've met Joe.
There is always a way! But you are such a... a Glotzkopp you cannot see! You'd rather go back to that city! To nothing! No woman! No children! No land!
Come back and make up a good-bye at least. Let's pretend we had one.
Who is Friedman?
Last night you upset my sleep. Tonight my social life. We have two minutes. My dinner guests are waiting.
You lost my money?
The playwright doesn't make the performance - and it doesn't just happen! And this one didn't - full of fire and music and whatnot, it was carefully rehearsed I have no doubt, over and over, full of those Bill Sampson touches!
So you watching Pearl Jam on MTV tonight?
You bet I will, Ma.
That's your father's diary, Ann.
Father's . . . I never knew he had a diary.
Wait a minute . . .
Huh?
Yes, Ma -- I'm ready --
Would the station put me up at a good hotel...?
Oh. Well, what's it on?
I was...he's gone...I mean it's not. It's over, y'know --
Yes. I had someone come to my door, someone I didn't want here and I told them to leave -- so -- it's no big deal. They left. I'm sorry.
No.
No.
No.
Billy, were you afraid of her, or of her love?
Yes, darling?
We should do it.
Yes.
Yeah. First Communion. Aren't I a little angel?
"The Strawberries"?
And they're not fully developed. This thing's not even an adult.
My God.
Good. Where are the English?
I don't know -- I don't know.
Let him go.
For the last ten miles I've been trying to figure out how to sleep sitting up. I'm getting to the point where I don't think there's any place named Sonora.
Catherine, you are a blanket of gloom. Wherever you are, the rain follows. Someday, you gonna smile, and we gonna declare a holiday.
Yes; that's it! A final volley from us both!
Yeah what?!
Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again.
Bad dream, darling?
You've got to be kidding.
There's a call I want you to make with me, Charles.
It can wait.
I'm sending Junior home in the car, Charles - with Oliver -
Dristan nasal spray.
All right, Mr. Nosey Parker. Let me ask you a question? Do you have a photographic memory?
Rich? I have an inheritance. It's two handred and fifty thousand dollars. That's exactly what it'll cost me, minus about five hundred bucks, to go all the way through med school. This is what I'm doing with that money. I could have done anything I wanted. I could have expanded my wardrobe, substantially.
Just for fun?
Have you ever studied Organic Chemistry?
Nobody does organic chemistry for "fun." It's unnecessary. Especially for someone like you.
Yeah.
Now?
I want to try.
I want to be John Malkovich. Tomorrow morning. Plus I'd like to meet this partner of yours.
I'll protect you, Dollface.
... Why, yes, he is... Is your leg feeling any better?
Don't be ridiculous. There is no such thing as a portal into someone else's brain.
Why do you say that, Mr. Marquez?
Don't be sorry. Help me.
I'm sorry, Corky ...
Bullshit, you killed him. Not me. You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.
You murdered Gino!
Saved me? You don't even know me. You used me, Caesar, just like I used you. All part of the business.
Did you feel anything?
My mother would die.
I need to ask you something, Mr. Nelson.
I want you to try something with me, okay?
The play's going to be really good.
You don't miss a thing.
If not Wessex the Queen will know the cause and there will be no more Will Shakespeare.
He's relentless. A major asshole.
You try to center on the big issues, y'know. What it's all about. What this whole trip has meant. But then, the really big issues keep swamping y...
You look sick. But you look... together. Mentally tough.
The primo stuff is great for pain.
I think my 'primo shit' got left in my 'bellbottoms.'
Brad Kovitsky.
What did you guys think?
Yeah!
Was it okay?
Behind me. I'm making these slides out of these old pictures and paintings and stuff.
No, don't do that...
It's temporary.
'In the still...still of the ni-ight...I held you... held you so ti-ight'...take it, man...
Is that what you're thinking about?
But he isn't a menace! He told me what he came here for.
That's what I'm trying to tell you. We mustn't do anything about it. Believe me, Tom, I know what I'm talking about.
You don't understand. You don't realize how important it is.
I helped him cook the books, Ed. I did do that.
How's the new job?
You think so? Do you really?
I'm afraid of who I am.
Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
Could I try that?
I'm cool.
J.J., Steve isn't...
At the way you ask funny questions, Josie Mae!
You know something, Molly? I like it on my own. I never got used to sharing a bed, not really.
I don't mind it. It was harder before the war. Trying to keep up appearances. Now it's patriotic to be poor.
Get that thing off me, Fergus --
I swear to God, Jos. When is the last time you went on a real live date?
Whoops! Yikes, I didn't expect to see you up here.
Room with a toilet, got it.
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?
Well, you don't just invite a random pregnant teenager into your house and leave her unsupervised. I could be a total klepto, for all you know.
I did steal a squirt of perfume. What do you think? It's Clinique Happy.
You're soaking.
If by "we" you are referring to men, then I have to say that just the once would do.
Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
Enough of what?
Maybe I've been a little unfair. But is this really the time?
But... the King -- my king -- didn't he pay my ransom?
I'd like to be ready when he gets back.
But what? Is there anything so terribly wrong about... making a decision and wanting to hurry? Do you think I've stolen... my car?
I'd really rather not. Please. Can't we just settle this and...
I think I have the necessary papers. Is there a Ladies Room...
That's right...Don't ever think that you and I are the same - we're not even remotely similar. I did what I had to do for myself, for my own self preservation - not to live out some bizarre role playing fantasy. My husband was sick -
I don't think so...This isn't a game you know...There aren't points or leagues. Sure I killed my husband - but I am no killer.
Where's the money?
I think I'm going to throw up. I am. I'm going to toss.
Oh, no.
You think so?
I had to arrange about the trip.
Oh -- careful, Mr. Preysing.
Here, hold up!
With me.
What? Why?
I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
Marty, Thomas and Virginia are here. They had another fight with your Aunt Catherine. So they ask me, would it be all right if Catherine come to live with us. So I said, all right with me, but we have to ask you. Marty, she's a lonely old lady. Nobody wants her. Everybody's throwing her outta their house...
But he's seven. What kind of stress can he have?
But I would be Valentine and Silvia too. Good Nurse, God save you and good night. I would stay asleep my whole life if I could dream myself into a company of players.
Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
I'm just going to my car.
Yes.
No.
I was at home.
Why would we do that?
Ram n were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before. They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
You mean you're ready to give up?
Steve...
It's a lot to them. They'd do anything to open that mine.
Whose funeral? We're doing all right. There hasn't been a scab near the picket line for three days.
You know it is!
Good. Because I've been waiting to see your art projects all week and I'd feel terrible if all you thought about was your father not being there.
Oh darling that's wonderful! I always knew you could do it.
How was your day?
It doesn't matter.
No -- but I can get it for you.
Thank god!
Right. Call me Christy.
I don't think I've ever spent this much time with someone who didn't even ask my name.
Oh.
What?
I gave you your life twice. I'm asking you to give me mine once. I need the money.
A bad mother. By any standards. I've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. I know just how bad I was.
No, I guess not. It was pretty lousy of me, I guess, to be a child at the same time you were. Not to stop being a child just because I had a child. I guess I was a real stinker not to be a grown-up when you needed a grown-up.
And making you feel bad at the same time, huh? But that's the way I am, you know, the way I've always been. Always picking on poor little Roy.
Not really. I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. That's what all our friends think, anyway.
That shit is nothin'. I remember, I had just turned 14. With this fuckin' asshole who was like 18. I don't even remember his name. I think it was John or Jake or something. I remember he had a brother named Lentil because I would always joke and call him Lentil Bean. This was away at like sleep away camp with your friends and shit.
Do you wanna be a hall monitor all your life?
Pommeroy.
I'm leaving Sunday.
Lauren?
Don't make me have to use this.
C'mon, I say we bounce now, kick it for a lil' bit, play some craps. ...Maybe spend the night?
You can't treat me like this. I'm not a child!
Not true.
Have you ever kissed anyone?
I'm gonna marry Mr. Bixler.
It is not.
I don't know.
What do you mean?
Paula, how far would you go to catch Zack?
I haven't made up my mind.
He's beautiful...
You serious about having him over?
Okay. I'll read it tonight and call you tomorrow. It doesn't seem to be too long.
That don't justify trying to trap a boy by getting pregnant, Lynette! Nothing justifies that. I can't believe you're even thinking like that. I mean, that's really backward.
I never used to think I'd do something like that, but now I'm not so sure. You ask me, nine weeks just ain't long enough to get a guy to fall in love with you.
Why fucking not! I deserve it.
I've been trying to find you all day.
That guy's band is playing tonight... Alien Autopsy.
What thing?
God, I'm so sick of Seymour.
Anything... may I sit down?
Oh yeah... maybe... Seymour's going on his big date tonight and I kind of want to be around when he calls, so I can hear how bad it went.
No. I never feel like that.
I think we made a mistake here.
Fine, Quincy.
This is it, lover. You're stepping onto that stage a nobody and presto-change-o, you're coming back the greatest puppeteer the world has ever seen.
Doesn't he know how important tonight is to us?
Sorry about your game.
Feeling the pressure?
My advice to you? Don't die.
Oh God...
Somehow, his blanket always looked like a cape, even the nurse said that. He loves to hear that story, over and over. How he was born a magician.
Do we have to?
What?
I do. I really do. OK. I have to do some shopping alone. You go out for a few drinks and then pick up your things. Don't hurry and I'll be back before you to let you in.
Hello.
Bob are you alright...?
Hi.
Here's weak...Mom said she was gonna talk to the teacher and Brad's parents!! Can you believe the humiliation???
That's so weak.
You know what that creep and his frogfaced footmen are calling me now? In front of the whole world? Frosty, the Snow Bitch!!
Eight, six, and four.
Yeah. But not any more.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He doesn't trust you.
You don't believe in anything?
Interpreted by another guy like my father.
I knew he wouldn't come.
Hey, you didn't pay me!
Leah just told me you were going with her.
Oh yeah?
Oh yeah...
Are you my big hard hero?
Are you my big brave boy? Are you my brave hero?
You sod.
No.
Oh Jesus oh Jesus oh Jesus.
For a ride.
So, you were a geek. Big deal.
I'm afraid I don't understand. I simply wish to know --
Well hello there, young employee of the Sidewinder.
What can you tell me, young man, about the various flavors of "frozen yogurt"?
Shh, it's his answering machine... We hear the indistinct traces of a musical message followed by a faint BEEP.
What does it stand for?
I'm not jealous, and I don't care. I just know he doesn't like Katrina and I don't think he should toy with her emotions like that. She seems so nice and all.
Is there anything I can do?
You promised me!
I put on a lot of weight over Christmas.
But the thing is-I mean, since our discussions here, I feel I have a right to my own feelings. I think you woulda been happy because... uh, uh, I really asserted myself.
What do you mean? What kind of person am I?
No, I'm not. I'm just really busy.
what?
One night he took us editors out to celebrate after a deadline. Eventually Dave and I were left alone and we got to talking - not like teacher and student, but like two adults.
It's the story or Salome. I think I'll have DeMille direct it.
-- I like myself far too much, far too much.
And it's over...?
Joely...
Do you know The Velveteen Rabbit?
Let him go, Stan. I can help.
It's my favorite book. Since I was a kid. It's about these toys. There's this part where the skin Horse tells the rabbit what it means to be real. I can't believe I'm crying already. He says, "It takes a long time. That's why it doesn't often happen to people who break easily or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don't matter at all, because once you are Real you can't be ugly, except to people who don't understand."
Sit down and eat--you'll be late.
Isn't there something you...
You're shaking.
It's coming -- I rode on ahead. I have to speak with the Captain of the English army... his name's Talbot...
How the hell would I know? I wasn't a philosophy major.
Let him try.
Dad, I'm sorry.
Nicholas...
It's the only way, Bud. Now trust me.
...they treat me like a child. I, I...to bare my body.
Everybody, they, they, they treat me like a...
Is...Is the Movie!
I don't want to take my shirt off in that con...What are these things that they're asking of me...? Wha...wha...wha... I try to be good; the only thing I care about is...
I...I...
We're going to get court martialed, you know that.
Sorry.
Yeah, it would suck big time. I'd kill myself first.
Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'?
Loser.
Call me later.
Do you always have to call him that? The Suit? It makes you sound like such a hick. His name is Michael.
Yes. It killed them, unfortunately. But it keeps the blood warm.
The red dress? No. My black one. Then I'll be just like him.
Clo-Clo?
I don't know, he didn't say anything.
What?
...I can find a place tomorrow, then I'll be outta your hair.
You got a girl--am I screwing something up by being here?
Well... the couch would be all right...
I know you! What can this possibly mean to anyone who doesn't "need" meaning - "Who goes with the Mystery" -- who pretends he isn't scared to death.
I don't want you to say anything. I don't need you to say anything.
Fine. More eggs or should we just fuck on the linoleum one last time?
He's waiting for you.
What was the most points your Daddy ever got in Junior High?
One time Magic scored forty-eight points, and they only had six minute quarters and he sat out the whole fourth.
I don't care.
I'd just tell my sister, Lena.
No we can't. We can never leave once you start talking about tenure... and vacation pay... and parking privileges and... oh shit! let's just go to California now, right now, before it's too late.
I'm serious. It's gonna be hard to get enough.
Nothing.
I thought we were going to talk. Last night.
To have a good time with you until you have to go.
No-one should think themselves wiser than me! It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning. It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded! It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely!
Why not?
I just don't think it would...
I just don't think it would work.
Tomorrow?
Jill's coming with us.
She's incredible... She loves you, George.
That's why I'm quitting. I want to go some place where I can be a woman.
I'm so sorry about that. It was rude. I think I just got nervous for some reason.
All street mimes should be executed.
We keep them.
What's your other question?
Where have you been?
That's what I was hoping you'd tell me.
We have to talk.
Charlie called at eleven thirty looking for you. You were with her, weren't you?
You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you.
A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri.
Boy--
They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means.
He said how you was really Three Fingered Jack out of Missouri... an' Bill said "Same Three Fingered Jack that dynamited the Rock Island and Pacific in '69 killin' women and children an' all?" An' Ned says you done a lot worse than that, said you was more cold blooded than William Bonney or Clay Alisson or the James Brothers an' how if he hurt Ned again you was gonna come an' kill him like you killed a U.S. Marshall in '73.
Not on purpose. But he started hurtin' him worse... makin' him tell stuff. First ned wouldn't say nothin'... but Little Bill hurt him so bad he said who you was...
Hi.
I don't believe vou.
...which I did not get.
Well, I just came from an audition...
Yeah. You're so lucky. He really loves you, too. He's always telling Walter how wonderful you are.
He is kind of cute, isn't he?
Now you listen to me, asshole, I know your gun is behind the bar ...
Maybe gay isn't the right word. But, anyway, it's been rough with him... whatever the fuck he is. Heheh. My significant other... heh heh. And I guess on a certain level, I want to break it off, but I feel... y'know... it's like this constant questioning and re questioning. Do I end it? Should I give it more time? I'm not happy, but what do I expect? Relationships require work. You know the drill. The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right? So then I think I should settle -- which is not necessarily the best word -- I mean, he's a good guy. It's not really settling. Then I think maybe I'm just a victim of movies, y'know? That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be. But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it. You know? Agreed? But then I think he is a good guy and... It's complicated. Y'know?
Well, I've been having a bad time of it with um, my boyfriend, I guess.
You fool -- you damn fool.
Okay, I guess.
I could be her.
Such as?
Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
What? No. No.
You could have infected him, isn't that right?
I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
Really?
Um-hum.
Alright, so what have we got?
Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
Why the change? What about your work?
Enzo, stop bitching, will you?
Hey, man, I'm a hip chick.
Yes, well...
Sir?
You could help me try and figure it out! I gotta figure out what to do, and you could try and help me.
I suggested we go to the police, but you didn't like that; so, frankly, Louise, I'm all out of ideas.
Well, what's the big rush, Thelma? If we just give 'em some time, they'll come to us...! Oh Christ. I'm just not ready to go to jail yet. Why don't you go out to the pool or something and I'll figure it out...
Give me the keys.
You're not touchin' that car.
My stuff's in the trunk! God! You care more about that car than you do about most people.
Most people just cause me trouble, but that car always gets me out of it.
Games?
Fired?
...Yes.
Showdown.
Dick, we need some time apart --
Yeah, you're alright. But you're certainly not happy. So what happens if you get happy? And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable? What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?
Take it easy, though.
I know it, I know it.
You'll get a heart attack like that.
I'm not going to leave him be just so he can stab us in the backs the minute we turn around. I have been through too much to lose it all now just because the two of you don't have the stomach to do what has to be done.
Then step aside.
I know, but so is the enemy -- they're falling back -- Paris is ours...!
You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you?
Just bundle up. It's supposed to freeze tonight. We'll see you in the morning.
What sort of problems are you planning exactly?
Oh I thought I'd steal the station wagon, drive up to a commune. Or set the house on fire. You know.
Shut up.
So... bring up the reinforcements!
We'll work it out...
S'Okay, Maude. You know your lines...?
I see. We need to get you one of those plant misters. We can spray you like a fern.
We'll have to pick up a copy.
I spent a week in Morocco for the story. It was incredible.
Sidney...I...I don't do this sort of thing...
This sort of thing!
A girl needs a little romancing before she -
Shall I leave, M'lord?
Never look behind -- only ahead!
And the Brocketts?
That's what I want to do. I want to make a snowman.
Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. Nice car. How's that place?
Dig the square wardrobe!
University and 10th--Want to carry my books?
Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
What's your opinion?
You going there?
Do you know a Marie?
No... do you?
Why should I?
I don't know.
What?
The kids take me.
From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
Those are all from the fair last year. Abbott and me were judges at the pet show.
And I'm sorry for you, too, Sidney. You're going down with the ship.
I'm sorry about Steve, not myself. I'm even sorry for my brother. To be so lonely, without one real friend in the world - to have to hang on to a worthless rag of a girl like me because she's his only real family -
Thank you Ben. That was so sweet of you. Goodnight Annabelle. Sweet dreams.

...the...
But, but, but, "they" would find out.
We can't afford a war.
Yes
I came here to see that you stay alive. The people need a living breathing alternative to Commodus, a hero.
It's my brother's neck you want, not mine.
You're kidding. Can't you shoot him or something?
I have a job for you and I don't have much time.
I'm on a special phone, may I speak freely?
Is it pretty?
Well, it has buttons.
No one does nothing, Jeff.
What are you so worked up about?
He's just being nice.
I didn't stutter. You heard me.
Actually, no. I've got everything under control. I'd like to clean up myself a bit. I'm going to take a bath. Dinner'll be ready in about a half hour.
Fine. They're all having a good time. How many more shots do you have?
Sorry I'm late. Richard called.
I want you to come.
You all put together?
No, Eve, I won't forget...
There's some loose characters dressed like maids and butlers. Who'd you call - the William Morris Agency?
My back's open. Did the extra help get here?
Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you.
God, I adore you.
Shit.
With who?
We should head over.
Zeke.
No, it's more like a leave of- Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, they fired me.
-- yes, Jill.
Jake.
Sir Henry, Mr Brown is standing in the courtyard. I have no wish to go riding.
This is my house too!
You're not from around here, are you?
You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day.
Drove into Superior? What for?
Danny's not coming?
Hey Josh.
Where do I get it stamped?
What does that mean?
Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
I don't want you to hurt me.
Do you care about me?
Casper.
Casper, where's Telly.
Casper, where is he?
That's fine.
No nuns, got it.
What makes those fellows think that a newspaper is something rigid, something inflexible, that people are supposed to pay two cents for -
I've just made a shocking discovery. The "Enquirer" is without a telephone. Have two installed at once!
Tom--you tol' me--you promised you wasn't like that. You promised me.
I know. You introduced Jacqueline to us -- but how could you tell -
There's a piano in the street.
Do you know them.
I thought they opened at seven. If I left my car would it be ok?
Can I ask you, can I trust to leave my keys with you and give them to you so that when they get here you could give them to them? BARRY Ok.
You don't care about me and you definately don't care 'bout your son.
Mookie, you must think I'm stupid or something. You're gonna run outta here and I won't see your black ass for another week.
I mean porno movies.
You mean these are the only kind of movies you go to?
Be a man.
That's Bensinger. That's his desk.
Bensinger -- of the Tribune.
They don't have to feel like slaves.
Luis is a despicable twit.
Mmmm...thanks, Patrick.
Hello.
I don't know.
Then why'd you call me?
I don't want to talk about it.
Well, what, then?
No, he's not dangerous. Not physically.
Well, what? Is he dangerous?
No, it's nothing like that.
Not today. I've got other plans.
You would have had a full scale revolt on your hands.
Now, Jabez! I've got on my Sunday bonnet and I'm going to church with my husband. Almost the first time since the beginning of winter -- and if that isn't an occasion, I don't know what is.
Don't worry, Gina! Mummy and Daddy love each other.
Poor Father . . .
I thought he was supposed to be terribly ill.
That was what we were led to believe . . .
Poor Mother was completely taken in.
Too right . . . but he doesn't have a show! Nobody gets into Mother's draws except Daddy!
Yes, but only when it's mutual. And this is far from mutual.
You know, I wonder what the SecNav would think about it. If I spoke with him.
Well, I spoke with Mr. Hayes this morning myself -- and told him the deal was off. No more test cases. He was only too happy to oblige. Don't play politics with me, little darlin'. You'd be up way past your bedtime.
They're tight.
Well, they're aspiring to be sevens.
Norman, please! Don't!
You're a prince.
Good.
Hi.
You were screaming you weren't Nick! And we just didn't fucking believe you!
I... you told me your name was Rudy. You told me a million times, back in the truck, telling me you weren't Nick --
What are you talking about?
What?
You said it a million times!
Hi.
No. Really. For real. Really.
You're a shit.
Yes. Fine.
I don't want to talk about it.
This was very sweet of you.
Well that's good. I'm happy to hear it.
You didn't have to do this.
I mean, it doesn't suit you.
We've got both.
It's a bright sound.
Something like that.
You should hear the bird.
Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
No.
Telly is at Steven's?
What?
Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you?
Well, it's Billy.
There ain't nobody here, Mr. Hillyer! Honest, there ain't!
He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman.
Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go.
Just a two-second dissolve.
Okay, Bobbie, just a two-second dissolve to the Rockwell.
Why won't you tell me your name?
I'm willing to tell you my name.
You have to tell me what you thought of the play.
How nice. How do you do, Senator?
Winston Churchill.
You sure can, son...
Frank!
I'll think about it...
You don't stand a chance. Even this is out of your league.
Oh gee, your journal. Could you be more queer?
If you lose, then that hot little Porsche of yours is mine.
You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
Would they go over my girdle or under?
Don't be silly. It's Saturday. Date night!
Okay. But let's have a girls night soon. Maybe a pajama party.
Is it?
Do you have a word limit you need to hit every day or can I finish?
One lonely, terrifying sea snake.
You've got to eat something. You're just nervous about going over to see if you're Diane Selwyn.
How was that for a tight squeeze?
Just until we can get out a special edition asking for your impeachment.
No!
I don't enjoy watching things suffer.
Make what?
Why'd you do that?
Okay, anything. Just...go. I've gotta work.
You're an animal.
Goody!
Oh, I know, I know, and you've been wonderful since I was widowed. But Mister Hebbing has-- -- you don't mind my telling him, darling -- -- suffered reverses. If he could...
The big one. The one that's most on your mind.
Did I? Or was that you? When you were hiding in the bathroom -- all conspiratorially like you were -- you became frightened, didn't you? Terrified. Like you were with the snake earlier -- and suddenly you have snakes slithering all over the floor. You did that, Norman.
Can I see you again?
But I am Barbara. I didn't die.
The storms have done everything they can to me, I don't hate them. I don't even hear the wind. It blows beyond me. It was on such a night as this that Barbara died.
It's about time we did! It's about time Margo realized that what's attractive on stage need not necessarily be attractive off.
Then stop being a star - start treating your guests as your supporting cast!
This is my house, not a theater! In my house you're a guest, not a director-!
Happy little housewife...
How was I to know, my darling?
He came back, he says he caught a rabbit. I'm cooking it.
He keeps asking me questions about you. Do you know him? Do you recognize him?
What do you mean, poetry?
I did do that, didn't I?
No, you draw no secrets from me, as you drew them from Jacqueline. You are not one of us yet. You're clever, Louis, but I recognize your interest in me for what it is worth. You are only curious. You have never loved a woman who had but one arm.
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
I don't know, nobody does. I'm an employee.
Welcome back.
I feel in love with George again.
I hardly recognize you with a beard.
What?
Where are you?!
Okay. I just thought as long as it was paid for --
You'll miss your train, Jeff.
A hundred dollars? I wouldn't call that cheap. And you must be paying somebody something for the use of the apartment --
You run along -- I want to fix my face.
Fuck.
I already told you you were gonna get lucky, Jack...
Tir Asleen.
Use the philosopher's stone! Hur- ry! Invocation! Release them!
Tell that to Dr. Freud! Along with the rest of it...
No, I need to talk to you, about so many things...
Oh God, I'm so glad, Robert, that you're coming...
It'll be so good for you, and for Daddy, because you know, you've never really...
What are you doing here?
Dead!
She married an accountant named Stanley Kestenbaum.
Paranoiac!
Yep.
I'm the best.
When I was younger, I hitchhiked one hundred and twenty-seven hours without stopping, without food or sleep, crossed the continent twice in six days, cooled my thumbs in both oceans and caught rides after midnight on unlighted highways.
As I developed, however, I grew more concerned with subtleties and nuances of style. Time in terms of M.P.H. no longer interested me. I began to hitchhike in something akin to geological time: slow, ancient, vast. When I am really moving, stopping car after car after car, moving so freely, so clearly, so delicately that even the sex maniacs and the cops can only blink and let me pass, then I embody the rhythms of the universe. I am in a state of grace.
Nervous?
You're kidding.
So, what happened?
Wow. But I still don't see how ...
He kissed her.
You missed your plane? My life is over. My life is over. What have you done to me? What have I done? Fourteen years of Public Service...
I am big. It's the pictures that got small.
They're dead. They're finished. There was a time when this busi- ness had the eyes of the whole wide world. But that wasn't good enough. Oh, nol They wanted the ears of the world, too. So they opened their big mouths, and out came talk, talk, talk...
Get out.
Or shall I call my servant?
You are saying goodbye, aren't you...?
That word again! I don't even know what it means...
I have to talk to you.
How dare you tell me what God tells me to do!
Thank-you.
It's nothing. I got a telegram from Artie.
Ah. This is a biggie. Forget sneakers. Running shoes, jogging shoes, tennis shoes. Fifty to two hundred dollars a pair.
Tch.
Thanks.
Okay.
Hi.
Oh! I'm sorry...
Who remembers.
Mister McMurphy.
I got dry cleaning.
I am not!
I'm sorry. . . I'm. . .
Not personally.
Take us to Vegas.
I'm gonna throw up, Frank. I mean it. Let's drop it for the ten o'clock, okay?
You are such a great person Lloyd. I'm a good person, but you are a great person.
Who told you you could sit down here?
No. I do not cook for them. My daughter's no-good husband will not take one bite of our food.
We're going to have to go back out there.
That's not an answer, is it?
Backward.
Monica.
See you. Bye. Bye Diane.
Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist.
Yes.
Yes, I do. There's Ruth Barnes.
What?
That's not how our thing works! I hurl the accusations and you talk me down, remember?
I'm not mad. I'm in a fucking great mood. Despite the fact that I'm trapped in a fat suit I can't take off, despite the fact that everyone is making fun of me behind my back, despite the fact that your little girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday...
Your mom must be really glad you're not taking me.
Very pleased to meet you.
Yes.
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Doctor. Uh, Alvy-Alvy, that was the show. They said everything is fine. They found a replacement, so they're going to tape without you.
Well... H-h huh... Oh, good... Yes, I'll tell him.
What was that?
Aren't you going to get that?
Tell me you don't hate me Louis. I did it for you -
Oh wait, you met him... remember that guy Josh? I'm like practically obsessed with him, but I can't do anything about it because Becky would freak out.
Actually, I've got a total crush on this one guy right now, but it's a really fucked-up situation...
I wonder if you really like all these old records or if you only like the fact that nobody else likes them?
Through someone else?
No.
I was appalled, just as you are now.
And you weren't shocked?
She stopped eating completely...
And what happened?
About two years before.
This was before her pregnancy?
He talked to you Himself?
Agnes, it has come to my attention that you have stopped eating. Why is this? AGNES I've been commanded by God.
I'm not hungry.
You know where I'm from?
Well, thank you anyway.
Ok. That's why. I had trouble locating your school records at Berkely and UCLA. Your name change -- they had no official enrollment --
Lloyd, I want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...
Something simple. A fur coat over a nightgown...
"Please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion - but it's most important that I speak with you. Please" - it's underlined - "meet me in the Ladies' Room. Eve."
Are you going to stay in the city or go up to Connecticut?
No! Don't! Please!
Probably first thing in the morning. It's too late to start now. I'm going to try not to do too much driving in the dark.
Well do you like him?
You think I'm some sort of sap?! Don't you?!
No... I can't!
Okay.
Eyes closed.
That was cool.
Maybe you should try it on your friend Ronald sometime.
What are you saying?
Oh come on Cecile. He's crazy about you.
Is it that obvious?
That's so romantic. Have you responded?
About the Ottos?
I mean, the way they look. Their hair and clothing...
No, nothing like that. The Ottos are what I'd call model citizens. They're regular at town meetings. They give their opinions in a respectful way. They always help out at various fund-raising bazaars in town , though they aren't church goers.
Oh yes. Like I said, they always came out together to see him off to school. It's like he was their little treasure. He was such a beautiful boy. That's a picture of him on the wall there, behind Abbott.
Yeah, what?
He didn't believe me. He said that if I don't get him the money tomorrow he's gonna kill me. Then he started hitting me.
And?
He'll kill you, Lenny.
Yeah?
He has to go, Samuel.
No --
What do you mean?
I know.
Wynant dead? Does Dorothy know?
I'm sorry.
Are you depressed about your daddy, honey?
I 'magine it's me then, id'n it?
You're depressed that I come along.
Well good. So you're human.
Did it go the way it 'uz supposed to?
For a while.
Yeah?
We needed to know all we could.
Nothing yet.
I never did, Benjamin. Now let's --
No.
Oh, well, I'm goin' uptown, too.
Is it?
I don't.
I did.
It's a crime.
So you can call me "naive," Mister LaPlante.
Sure you can, just--
He needs me here.
Huh?
Two minutes on your sons' birthday. You know, it's not going to kill you.
Everything's good. Everything's fine.
Oh, my, "a summit conference." I wonder where I was, polishing silver behind the coal bin.
Kambucha mushroom tea...
She hasn't mentioned this.
You're a cross-dresser.
That. And. Annabelle is over her head. With Brad 'The Dreamboat' Kovitsky.
Luke's depo ran late. I promised I'd take notes.
So I have to tell you something in confidence...
Well, I don't know the people, of course, but as a rule, I don't think a mother-in-law should live with a young couple.
I've never done this before.
I...wait, what are you talking about?
I don't think so. I feel. I feel a bit funny.
Things always look much worse in the morning.
You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about. You won't care who's in your damn movie.
D-d-d-duke. The D-d-duke of Death.
There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about.
We're down to a "couple" now, huh?
What?
Oh. Did you say something?
Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect.
Everybody shut up.
Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
Should we get a what?
Oh.
I can't afford this stuff right now.
You sure?
and I keep, you know, it's-
In-in... Alvy, in my dream Frank Sinatra is holding his pillow across my face and I can't breathe.
Yeah, and he's strangling me...
Oh, I told her my dream and then I cried.
Yeah.
Yes, Mama.
Yes, Mama.
I don't want you drinking, Frances.
...So what do you think?
I know that, Dad, but --
But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
Shakespeare. How he described a night like this--"Look how the floor of heaven is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold". What about you? What are you thinking about?
Don't.
Toys for adults. Where are your toys for adults?
Yeesh, they sound like a cult. Besides, they're greedy bitches. They already have three kids!
All right, how about this one? "Healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love."
No, I heard you. I just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." I'm looking for something a little edgier.
You're not listening to me.
What did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?
I'm fine are you ok?
What is this?
The hell you call me?
I've found a bungalow to rent up the towpath, Clive. I never want to leave the river again. The children have had such a wonderful summer.
LESLIE I'm sorry - I - I didn't know what to think
You want me to wear white for you? You must be madder than I thought...
WE are over.
Where are you going?
Quietly.
I'd say logic more than faith. The odds were on my side.
Champagne please.
Okay.
Right, right -- Isn't she fun to tease?
Three...I just thought of a third... If you talk about it, you don't have to do it.
I never know when you're telling me the truth.
Nothing?
How'm I gonna know 'bout you? They might kill you an' I wouldn't know. They might hurt you. How'm I gonna know?
Then what, Tom?
Tommy, they'll drive you, an' cut you down like they done to Casy.
Being a good Muslim, a good nurse and a good wife.
And dogged when I set my mind to something.
There's a few things you don't know about women, Brother Malcolm. They're possessive and vain.
But Brother Bembry says I'm tall enough for a tall man.
If it's just idle, I won't answer it.
He won't discuss it. Just calls it history.
That's your name?
What would your mother say to that?
Hi, everybody. Sorry to be late -- had to have dinner with my depart- ment chief --
You ate?
We've met.
-- This morning. The Corinth Coffee Shop. He was looking for a doctor.
It's like you resent us David. Resent the life you have.
I haven't heard of half of those.
Yes, sir.
It doesn't protect your head, though.
How'd you find this place?
I loathe bats.
What is that?
Because I want to know what's happening.
What's the matter?
What is it?
Because we're completely mismatched.
You mean the World Series? I thought the Red Sox were winning.
It can't be all that personal.
We're able to surprise each other.
Say you promise.
I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
At one. Promise?
He couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.
Sure.
I'll have lunch ready by one.
Where are you going?
For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
Need a little help with that, Mr Collins?
Okay.
You're so wonderful. The jewelry's not so bad, either.
Come on. Can I keep this one in the house?
The Valley?
What dam?
No.
Eighteen. Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.
But you was going to fight for me.
He's not my boyfriend. I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for. Not yet that is.
You have no right! You have no fucking right, you bastards! Get the hell out of here --
GET OUT!
Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me.
I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it!
Okay. All right, so whatta yuh saying, now? That e-e-everybody o-o-on the Warren Commission is in on this conspiracy, right?
We've been through this.
Lyndon Johnson?
Yeah, Earl Warren?
Then everybody's in in the conspiracy?
You don't want me.
I have these strange thoughts, I don't know where they come from. I can't explain it.
But that's what happened before.
You still want to be transferred to the other paper?
She can leave me. As a matter of fact, I've already left her. Don't worry, Brad - I'll live.
It's simpler than that, Brad. A society girl can't stand the gaff, that's all. Other things are important to her - social position, what they're saying on the front porches at Southampton, is it going to be embarrassing to meet somebody or the other at dinner -
Hey, Brad! I've been analyzed an awful lot tonight - let's have another brandy.
Is that what your little note says?
Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being. Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout...Every idea...Every single thing, right down the line.
Must be tough living life according to a few scraps of paper. Mix up your laundry list and your grocery list, you'll be eating your underwear.
Detective - can you tell us what happened here?
Oh, yeh.
This'll work, huh?
Maybe twenty.
Get them out of here!
Me neither. Who was the boy she was talking about, Eugene?
It's important for you to know who your father was, isn't it?
Because Becker resigned after the charges brought against him by State Patient Advocacy Groups.
I see you've done your homework. Alpine Grove's undergone a lot of changes since then. At the time, we didn't have the...resources to help our patients the way we needed to. Now, we do. And things are different.
Well... let me know how your search turns out.
I don't really know.
My God, Sonny - you oughtta see - Alla Brooklyn is here! On all 3 networks!
I talked to the FBI, I told them about you, they said if you just come outta the bank it's gonna be okay.
There's no hard feelings, Mr Denham! I just want to come to the island with you!
So you can give me more shit?
I'm trying to communicate how I feel, Jeff. You know raise consciousness. Make people think for a change.
Mn-hm.
Jeff! Let's go!
It's his name.
Oh, it was... really weird. But she's a very nice woman.
And I didn't have to lie down on the couch, Alvy, she had me sitting up. So I told her about-about the-the family and about my feelings toward men and about my relationship with my brother.
I beg to differ, Doctor. You work in a madhouse. Your every waking moment is governed by the insane.
You're new to Charenton, yes? Perhaps you're not yet familiar with my husband, and his unusual case.
Is... is it... loaded?
That's okay...
Who does?
Do you have any old Indian records?
There's a big black spider in the bathroom.
Welcome, podner. By God, it's great to have you here. It's an honor. Sorry I took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days -- and a heap of planning to do.
Oh.
No way. I told her two, three years, maybe, for such an expens...
Are you kidding? It is so much better than the one Rachel showed me!
Just better.
And you live in this building all by yourself?
Thanks.
We will
A mistake?
I like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it?
Here?.
Sorry.
I feel better. Do you?
All them people shoutin' your name like they were doing tonight! Shit! That arm you got'll get'chu on a box of cereal...
Um ... They like wanna ask you a question ... I didn't know how to handle it. So ...
Not directly anyhow ...
How did you get so many?
Daffodils?
What was that all about?
It was futile. We went all over.
I'm going out with Greg tomorrow.
Go die, asshole!
There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him.
It's beautiful. It's just beautiful. They have a beautiful relationship.
This is Claudia, Anna's friend... You've never met my husband, have you?
Don't mention it.
Whatta you mean, a tad restless? Oh, my God, I mean, they hated me.
You just can't bear the idea of good news.
Cast stood me up.
Who would want to do such a thing as that?
Yah, it's this vehicle I asked you about yesterday. I was just wondering -
No, sweetie. Cynicism is bullshit.
Yes, I know.
Well, I was almost born here. It took place in that wild country beyond the pass. My father and mother were in a party of explorers who got lost and wandered around for a year. When Chang found us, only Father and I were alive. But he was too weak to climb the pass. He died on the way. I was brought up here by Father Perrault himself.
No, you would not, Louis. Danger hold you to me.
Come on, Stacy, it's your section and your man.
Yeah, but I fucked up. You can take it. Really.
Do you think that guy's cute?
Don't you like him?
How's it going.
Hi. It's me. I got a favor to ask you.
I just wonder what could be more important than what's going on with dad.
... well I'm glad you told me.
I can't lie here. I've got to get up and trim that darned Christmas tree.
I heard he was drunk at Toby's last night and got in a fight with Hettie. He drove off without her...
...Jack's turned into one of those men who are permanently angry. He used to be a sweet kid, but it's like, when he found out he couldn't play ball anymore, he changed. Now he's like everyone else.
Jack's sort of sensitive, I guess. More than most. But he'll be okay in a few weeks.
Wade! How can you even think such a thing? Why would Jack Hewitt do that, shoot Twombley on purpose?
Hurry, Suzette.
This is me telling you about me.
All right.
But you, God, you knew that was going to happen sooner or later. I can't live like this!
Want anything special for dinner?
Okay.
Dark Windows. I got him all hopped up about it.
My gentle Captain... I'm staying.
Uh-huh.
Says who? Not important -- ha-ha-ha. I was dreaming -- Oh, no -- can't tell -- how embarrassing for me. Gosh.
Nooo. Is it your story?
Did you know I was an alcoholic?
What do you think of me?
You've known me nearly all of your life. You must have formed some opinion.
Yes.
I'm very neurotic.
Yes. We had a glorious night together. One day you'll remember and write about it.
I don't like sugar
Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet. You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder. So you gave the clarinet to Spencer.
Are you drunk?
You can't.
It was over with Bill before you ever came home. Maybe you don't remember it now, but you were pretty hot to see me back then.
You do?
Okay, then.
Uh, talk to you later. Bye.
The kids are sleeping.
It's nice to meet you. My husband has told me a lot about you... except your first name.
It's a nice name. William, I'd like you to meet David. David... William.
Am I going to lose you, Bill? Am I?
Call me when you get in...
Goodbye, Mr. Sampson.
We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and... and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
You are?
Bye. She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
Who's he?
Sam, he called me when he had nothing definite, nothing but a dissatisfied feeling. Don't you think he'd have called if he had anything...
Well?
It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you.
This mean your finally going to finish your thesis?
A book on the warehouse murders?
Hey, who's that?
No, sir.
Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom.
Perhaps I shouldn't go either.
I can't.
Look, Mr. Bebe, you can hold me to my contract, but you can't break me. I'm back, and I'm gonna make the best of it.
Harry, I hate being in love. I don't ever want to be in love again. I just hate it!
Don't tell me what to do, just give me his head on a platter!
Two lines! Two fucking lines! 'My wife returns from Europe tomorrow. I can't see you any more.' Just like that!
She took you shopping for a tie?
What's wrong with your paisley tie?
Where'd you get the tie?
It's not your taste.
Excuse me! You went to a party with her?
Oh.
No. You know how people talk. So I decided it would be better if we didn't see each other till everything is settled, divorce-wise.
I guess so.
Yes. You walking to the subway?
Not as silly as some. You know the silliest one? ...that we are gods. That we control events on the beach... that we can turn back time...
Want to play the game?
You say the truth. Go ahead. Don't be afraid. You want to win the game, don'tcha?
Good night, Mr. Baxter.
True.
Well, naturally. Of course.
You taught my child that I am some limp dick loser. Who didn't care about her pain.
I can't believe it!
When I go bird-watching. It's why I like coming here.
I am planning to go out and do some work.
Tomorrow night as a matter of fact.
Do you want to go gambling tonight? We could go out and play for a few hours.
Then come. I'm going to change. Watch TV. I'll be half an hour.
Well, then... I hope we don't run into any tonight.
He... he loved me.
Daddy! Daddy! I love you! Help me!
Well, you hate that job anyway. Why don't you just quit? You don't have to work.
Oh ho, so very infrequently.
They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you. I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand? That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me. I like Sting and you hate him. But the rest of this stuff... Who the hell is Nick Lowe? Or Gram Parsons? Or the Boredoms? I don't know these people. I...
I've disturbed	you. I'm sorry -
I thought they came right past here
I'm staying with the Countess.
Yeah.
Drunks are funny--
Old Don Quixote--man of the people Smith--
I can't believe you hung up on me, you dick.
Can I come?
I'll get home all right now.
Shoot, Italian boys love them some black women. They can't get enough of me.
Sometimes. But what's the alternative, not playing? You remember big Toni? She quit last year, now she's working at some bookstore. I mean, look at us. They treat us like we're Hollywood stars over here. We just played in the championship game. It doesn't get much sweeter than this.
So what are these Spanish guys like?
Did you move the bumble bee pendant?
What? You've been over here seven months and you ain't tapped anything?
I wouldn't know.
... they're checking the ratings...uh...
What are we talkin' on the split...
Well. Everybody has reversals. If you were never down how would you know when you were up?
It's in your play.
So who moved it?
It's about life.
What is it?
So. Is now a good time?
Huh! Really? Hotels?
Yes.
I don't believe it!
We cannot go into this later.
I will not calm down!
Oh, but it will end well for love?
It's a civilian facility.
And a hundred mile airspace.
... could it be a nested code of some sort?
At eleven at night? 70.
He just lost his best client. He called from the plane. I invited the guy over.
Dotty -- this is not "guy.". This is a "syndrome." It's called Early Midlife, About-To-Marry, Hanging Onto The-Bottom-Rung Dear- God-Don't-Let-Me-Be-Alone, I'll- Call-My-Newly Long-suffering- Assistant-Without Medical-For- Company Syndrome. And if, knowing all that, you still allow him to come over, more power to you.
Just kidding. About 10cc.
Oh! That's where that group got its name from.
Don't flatter yourself. I always liked that line.
What's this about? Because we fought?
Double.
She likes a Stolie, no ice.
Neutral ground. What's up?
Which ones? I bring them all.
I do not think you anything anymore. Just back from the hospital and already you are chasing after boys.
Perhaps we should get you uphill before the pills knock you cold.
Yes!
That's not faith, it's physics. The second law of thermodynamics.
What is it, Choco?
The day of our homicides.
But I thought you said that he was rather... simple?
What do you mean?
Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged.
Don't you think I would've done it if I wanted to? What can I do to make you relax, baby?
But we still haven't found Gustafson.
I adore hearing Thea sing -- but my poor head's beginning to ache. I'm so sorry.
I hope you get everything you want out of life --
I suppose it is.
M father will take care of it. Pappa is wonderful! No matter what happens, he makes me feel perfectly safe. I could never leave him. I should be utterly helpless by myself.
You are fortunate in your father.
I don't know. But as a scientist I have to consider that possibility.
Will you stay here for the night? You can leave in the morning. That's when my parents get back and --
You slipped on a T297 transfer just before lunch, didn't you?
Promise...please don't THX leaves the room.
But...you...
I don't need no more clothes, thank you.
Amen.
"Liebestraum."
Play it again.
With them?
It was warm. I was outside. The ocean?
Don't you think you'd like to go back to detecting once in a while, just for the fun of it?
It comes back. Flashes. My name.
Don't bother. I'm coming home.
Was it Pascow?
Jud, do you remember the name of the student that died on Louis's first day at work? The one that was hit by a car?
No, but, no, not at all. I'm sorry. You came to the doors, that's all and - - such good manners for someone worried about mines. That's all.
Excuse me. Yes? I don't have the key to that door.
I see. Then may be you're safe as long as you only play Bach. He's German. Kip is looking around the piano. Hana giggles.
Would you mind telling me what I did wrong to you to deserve your insults?
"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms..."
One night stand?
You called me by my name.
Dad already gave me this lecture. He's gonna meet me at the airport, then we'll go for some pizza, then we'll have dinner in bed with Shelly.
I've got some more clothes for you-- I just keep forgetting to bring them with me.
Well, I'm no doctor. All I know is, the next day they had really high fevers, and their faces got very fat. They baffled medical science, they were in a magazine.
I like the freak show.
I don't think that that roller coaster agreed with your bad stomach. You know Vada you have to watch what you eat here, I remember one time I went to a carnival with my cousins David and Frank, and they both ate hot dogs, and the next day they came down with nephritis.
Nephritis? It's a kidney disease, you don't get it from hot dogs.
What happened?
Perfect.
Uh, well, what'd she say? Is Pony coming?
You know my name.
Ich said you left.
I'll come down.
Hi Tom.
Thank you. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Nicky, please...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah. Uh-huh -
Why can't I go out there with you?
Yes, he is.
Well, who can tell what went on in there? I never even knew who Sethe was or none of her people.
I don't know him that well.
Stamp, don't tear me up this morning! I don't feel like it.
Her who?
I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible?
Yes?
Howard, your one o'clock.
Yeah, hi, I have a one o'clock with Dr. Mierzwiak. Clementine Kruczynski.
Yes, please have a seat. He'll be right with you.
May I help you?
How was Russia?
Don't overwhelm me with details, you know how I hate that. Did you get it fixed?
Your eyes are puffy. Did you take Valium again?
My last chapter's in there, and the damn machine's jammed.
I wanted her to have it when no-one else was around, they would have taken the baby to a hospital and left it with them, but it was such a difficult birth, there was so much blood and I panicked.
You tied the cord around its neck.
I left it with her and I went for help.
Before or after you killed the child?
Then she's a liar.
I doubt that's what she'd say.
Yes.
Agnes, can you hear me?
She said Michael.
I want you to remember if you can a night last January. The night Sister Paul died. Do you remember.
Don't worry about me. I can get jobs --
-- especially one like this.
You're wearing eyeliner. You look like a queen.
Who the hell is that?
When did you buy a gun?
You don't crap out of Spec-Recon and get another shot without dispensation from someone up in flag country. He's got a Sea Daddy somewhere.
No!
You want some?
I don't know, I don't care.
"In Washington..."
Wickwire said he was dry-docked in Washington between stints at Coronado...
Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just...all so sudden...
I don't know. My friends...
I woke up this morning at three and couldn't fall back asleep. Everyday I think I see more of Sam than I've seen in years.
I'm not sure why. It's just, I've never been anywhere else...
You can send somebody with me if you don't believe me!
That headboard.
Jake. No. No!
Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
-- and take this with you.
Who knows, I'm sure you don't -- but if it'll help any, I found it in your bed.
So who else was there besides Jackie? Huh?... huh?
You are a fanatic.
"Make" him?
At least I'm a growing person.
What rate?
I'm right enough to stand on my own two feet. Now take this Goddamn chain off...
The fuck you been doin' to me?
Why you got me chained?
Well I'm woke now... you can take this off.
Get this Goddamn thing off me!
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Yeah, you.
Hey! Oh!
What's the matter with you?
Since when do you talk like that?
You never spoke to me before.
You're quiet at work.
Guess I'm not like most women.
What's weird about that?
They're all assholes.
You don't hang out with the other guys.
Okay, okay. Okay.
Living together hasn't been so bad, has it?
Yeah.
Alvy, let's never break up again. I don't wanna be apart.
Alvy, what about... what if we go away this weekend, and we could-
You know I think that if you let me, maybe I could help you have more fun, you know? I mean, I know it's hard and... Yeah.
Would you, Mr. Phillips?
If you were in his shoes would you take one of us home?
Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you right in the mood--yes--yes.
No. What had you better--?
With or without 'em. Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at twelve o'clock.
Convene?
You're scared.
What?
Like... a Hawaiian sunset... the Grand Canyon. Things that remind you how beautiful the world can be.
And what?
Babies cry because they're afraid of the dark. And because they have no memories... for all they know... every night could be the last forever. Like, perpetual darkness.
That's not good enough. You've got to go back in time and take all those hours of darkness and pain and replace them... with whatever you wanted.
You want to kiss me...
Goodbye, Mr. Rieper.
I got back today. You can't imagine the excuses I had to make up to be here...
My turn. When was the first time the thought popped into your head that we might not make it?
So what'd they say?
We should live together.
Yes.
In the middle of all the pain?
I fell asleep.
And then what?
I got sicker.
And what happened?
I went to my room.
And what did you do?
Down... there.
Where?
That water's freezing!
Daddy!
Excuse me Harry, I'm sorry, I just wanna let you know that the flowers were delivered. And the room's all set up.
No, but what a pity life is like that.
You don't think much of yourself, do you?
Swimming?
Perhaps he really was a burglar -- But they don't kill a man for that.
You look beat.
He's better. Thank you for asking. How's your friend?
Oh, it's you again.
Maybe he's just a patriot.
Michael, it's not true. Please tell me.
We've got to find him. I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. That's all he said--the thing about the key?
What was it?
Did you talk to Paul?
Yes. I trust you.
I tried to tell them, but they wouldn't listen to me.
I'm not the maid!
I want what's mine, half the money. We get rid of Mickey, no one else dies. No one. Say yes, I understand.
We make a deal or I come out and hand this phone to Mickey.
Uh --
Mickey? What are you doing here?
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy, in the waiting room, but stay on the phone until I come out.
Fast.
Oh my God. Was anyone hurt?
A lot of works.
Yeah, we're the Stanislavski Catering Company.
No.
Didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. Didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.
-- plus the forty to Mason... how many letters is that?
We musta written what, twenty of 'em? And they were before this guy. One, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in Leavenworth --
No secrets, Mister Harding. Let's get it all out in the open...
God, I m so mad at him!!
Yeah, I know, but somehow I expect that from her, I mean, she'll do it with almost anybody, I don't know, I shouldn't stick up for her I guess, but him. He lied so... deeply!! Ooo, I want to watch him die!!
If you were in love with me, would you?
But if you were?
But I feel like maybe I could be really comfortable with you.
Say, what's going on here, anyway?
Tom...why don't I meet you there? I've got some last minute stuff I've got to take care of...Hey, how did you resolve your dilemma -- did you rent the tux or buy it...I knew it. How much? Wow...Okay...See you there...
I'm all wet.
A guy in the bar called me a dumb bitch today.
You're hopeless.
Last night. Alan Albright called me a handsome woman. Second time he's done that. Son of a bitch.
What?
She had the same.
Oscar wants you to call him.
I had a... salad.
Is it true?
You want to go to a movie tonight?
That would work.
No, we're not knocking boots. I got this internship while I still was at NYU, DeLa was impressed with my get up and go and hired me to be his assistant.
What do you mean?
A little. I just graduated from NYU film school. Cinema studies.
I wish I had your natural talent. God only makes that visit once in a while.
If that was suppose to be a compliment, I thank you.
You don't have to say that.
Don't try to use your blackouts to get out of this one!
Pensacola.
You can think whatever you want, Frank -- but I didn't kill Andrew, and I'm not going to prison for something I didn't do.
No -- I'm a survivor.
Spas T. Raikin, a leading member of an anti-Communist group.
Gary.
What'd he say?
Where were you? You know you can't keep anything from me.
Shouldn't we have buzzed him to let him know --
I wonder if you'd mind if we waited for him here, Mister Winston...
Maybe, maybe not. I have a feeling this guy is important somehow.
Where's Mike today?
But you know he did it.
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?
Good evening. I'd like a single for tonight.
I just don't excite you at all... I don't know what you want... I don't know what you like...
Whatever, do you remember? I've seen all your movies. When I was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. They said you were too real. I worship you. And I couldn't be more flattered, because I know the part I'm playing in Joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.
And I'm overwhelmed. And I want to do it justice. And I hope we can spend time together. And I'm gushing. It's my worst quality.
Oh my god. I've been so rude. I'm Skye Davidson. Has anyone ever told you, you look like Peter Sellers?
You've got some huevos bringing this... thing... into my rig! With everything that's been going on up in the world, you bring a nuclear weapon in here? Does this strike anyone as particularly psychotic, or is it just me?
Look, goddamnit, if you won't do something about it, I will.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
You dumb jarhead motherf--
Well... the store at Saltzburg... But you won't be going to Saltzburg for a while.
Telephone? The Gunthers across the valley. They're Mennonite. They have cars and refrigerators and telephones in the houses even.
No.
Wanna fuck?
Rita... I know what you're doing.
I know what you have to do, but let me do it.
What ... I..HAVE... to do.
You have a great future as a driver. If they don't arrest you first!!
Not really. We didn't have much to say to each other anyway. I never got to know him that well, but I knew enough to know I wasn't missing much. I keep that, because of all the fuckin' time I was there, that's the only picture I got of me in Japan. That's Japan.
Yeah, maybe it'll be okay. At least I'll get to see every movie for free, I guess... I had to lie and tell them I already graduated...
Are you kidding? It's a dream job! I can't believe you got a job like that without even trying... God, I wish that was my job...
I'm not sure... I mean... I guess because when we see something like this it seems really shocking and we have to figure out why it's so shocking?
And how does an image like this help us to see that?
It's complicated... I guess I'm trying to show how racism used to -- more out in the open and now it's hidden, or something...
And how do you think this addresses the subject of racism?
Well, no - it's more like a "found art object."
I dunno, but next week is my last class...
When are you finally going to get your diploma?
You say that over and over but you don't even know me!
Well, you did! Chet found out and he's nuts. It took everything I could do to keep him from coming here and killing you. You have to stop this stuff, Knox.
Oh, but it's fine for you to come barging into my school and make a complete fool out of me?
Just like that?! You just knew?
Why?
I'm being punished.
Dear Jesus...
I don't know.
My dear, I don't think a communion wafer has the recommended daily allowance of anything.
No I don't... the host is enough.
Yes, of God.
Of God.
Why didn't you take her to a doctor?
How can you be with Charley and Johnny Friendly and still be with me? Either way it's a lie. It's like there were two different people inside of you. You've got to be one or the other.
It's you who's being hurt. By keeping it inside you, like a poison. Sooner or later it's got to come out.
I don't want you to do anything. Let your conscience tell you what to do.
He was beating the crap out of me! I had to tell him something!
No. I have a date at eight-thirty.
I've been thinking about it for awhile, and then I was talking to somebody who kind of put things in perspective for me.
Since four.
Fine, thanks.
What bus?
Eight o'clock.
That wouldn't give us much time, would it?
Do you think I didn't hear her tonight, crying as if her heart would break? Here she is thinking Church is going to die.
She's finally asleep.
It was that place. That creepy cemetery up in the woods. Whatever disease the kids in this town have got, I don't want Ellie to catch it.
But they all said it was Rosebreen's.
Well, I do.
I hope I don't have to pay for that piece of information.
It's not a hundred miles. It's a hundred miles through three different kinds of terrain: Pure desert, mountains, a river. If the map is even real.
The ones in the box of files. The box of files? The one from your office?
He's not Army, it's not official --
But this guy you called, he's not even Army --
They were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. I wrote Colonel Doolittle, and told him I needed to see you before you go.
But that's not the point! What if all these things are somehow connected?
Oh no, Mr. Merrick. No. No son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.
What!
I can't tell you how distraught I was. All night long. What the hell happened?
Oh my God... What did they do! My God!!!
Go for a walk in Central Park --
A few years ago, I actually saw him do "Dracula" live. I thought he was much scarier in person.
It isn't brains. It's how you use them.
You don't call that music, though.
You know how the Sisters are.
He thinks he's Joe Gunn now.
You know it's for you.
It's boring, isn't it?
To quarter-horses.
Ohhh, that's lousy Scotch!
I'm going with you.
I enjoy crushing into you.
Oh. Okay.
Now, did you remember that, or...
But I came here to...
And I know checking into your life was inexcusable...
Nobody likes a snoop.
Bi-coastal parenting. Happens every day. Luke gets the kids every other summer, every other holiday, it's not ideal, but people make it work, and...
We can't live like that.
Luke. Can't live like that.
I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like you.
George Bailey lassos stork.
My baby.
Okay.
Okay.
Your father dropped off an extra check.
But you're planning to be?
Wait a minute, wait a minute. What's going on here? Did you come back here just to see her again?
Who? Elizabeth?
You mean you're still in contact with her?
But that was part of it?
Where did you get that?
You won't believe it! Guess!
Where?
Anthony's II!
No way... when?
Just now... I went with Seymour.
You cunt!
Yes.
What are you doing?
It's bad.
Nobody knows.
Hmm... Mike and Ike's.
God, Viktor. Why do you always have to make things so difficult for yourself?
Excuse us.
Five-- Six--
When you think about them... the money... the key ... does it make you remember anything?
Right. You know it's not like... You know there's a difference between sex, making love, and fucking!
Making love is like.
Hell yeah. I love. I love sex.
Foreplay. Foreplay.
It's grandmother style.
Let's talk about --
It's fine. I can bleep it out.
For what?
Alice is dead?
Well, I'm getting tired of it. I need your attention.
Alvy.
I just got back -- I don't know which end is up.
...What's going on with you two?
Marty.
If you say that, if you keep saying that, they will kill you. If they think you're not you, they will kill you. Don't you see? I know what you're doing, but it won't work!
I won't let him hurt you! He just wants what you know!
Just tell him what you know, Nick! That's all they want! And we'll get out of this!
Candy. Candy Kendall.
Because you'll use it against me. Won't you?
I'm serious. I've got a few ideas.
I see Bud because he makes me feel like Lynn Bracken and not some Veronica Lake look-alike who fucks for money. I see him because he doesn't know how to disguise who he is. There's more if you want to hear it.
Does all that make it harder for you to hate him or easier?
You don't like that you don't know how to play him. He doesn't follow the same rules of politics you do. That makes him dangerous.
I came out here with a dream. That's gone, but I settled for reality.
No. This is the means to the reality. But I'm not going to tell you what it is.
There're so many disinformation sites about Gary already. Where he has devil's horns or they crop him in with Saddam Hussein.
Who can we trust?
Come on. You're going to get us in trouble.
I'm saying don't do it accidently.
I'm just trying to help you guys out. It doesn't hurt to know something about Saudi Arabia.
You can let go of me now. I'm safe. How do they look.
We all see what we want to see... Coffey looks and he sees Russians, he sees hate and fear. Bud, you have to look with better eyes than that.
It was a machine, but it seems almost alive. Like a... dance of light. Bud, you have to trust me... please. I don't think they mean us harm. I don't know how I know that, it's just a feeling.
Gimme a break! Coffey, these things live three and a half miles down on the bottom of an abyssal trench! Trust me... they're not speaking Russian.
No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
I gave everybody the night off.
Don't you want me now LESLIE
It's what you would do to me
Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
Don't. I'm the one at risk here. If we're playing out what happened before, I won't survive.
I'm sure that's very flattering, Birdie, and I'm sure there's nothing wrong with that!
I'll tell you how. Like - let's see - like she was studyin' you, like you were a play or a book or a set of blueprints. How you walk, talk, think, eat, sleep-
How do you mean that?
Dwayne -
Well... let's say she thinks only about you, anyway...
The flashback in the courtroom, when she tells about being a school teacher.
Very becoming. It looks better on you than it did on me.
Nobody really wears that stuff, Paloma.
Enough with the clothes--
I only went for my last two years.
Oh, my mother wanted to keep me away from away from boys.
Excuse me?
Well, that kind of security can't be bought. Must be more comforting than a daughter to greet you.
Oh, you mean you...fix the hearts...of little babies?
Call if you get weird.
This conversation is not worthy of you.
Sure.
Why do you say that?
So that's it, just forget about us?
It's the oily fish tonight. Not before the plane ride.
You're awful kind to yourself, Norville Barnes -- the fact is you've slowed down, sitting up here like a sultan, not doing a lick of work! Why you know it's ideas that are the lifeblood of industry and you haven't come up with one since the hoop and the reason's plain to see! You've forgotten what made your ideas exciting for you in the first place -- it wasn't for the fame and the wealth and the mindless adulation of -- would you get out of here?!
...I've been watching you, Norville Barnes, even though you've been trying to avoid me --
Your i --
You mean you know about this?
They're going to discharge eight percent of the work force here at Hudsucker. Why, in New York alone that means eighteen hundred people out of work, people with wives and children and families --
Shutup! -- and don't think I haven't noticed how you've changed. I used to think you were a swell guy -- well, to be honest I thought you were an imbecile --
And I said I would never leave you.
I doubt I'd recognize a '63 Chateau Latour if I was sitting on it.
I doubt it, darling.
I mean if he was dead, I could handle that.
It's the waiting that's killing me, not knowing, you know? It's really hard on my mother. The doctor doesn't think my father'll make it. He says he was dead too long, after six minutes the brain starts to die and once that goes, close the door.
You want to keep him happy.
It's my first cigarette in over a year.
It's just as if I've seen a ghost today...
...Like you?
I can't go out.
Paulie, it's Thanksgiving. I've gotta turkey in the oven.
Thanks. I am. Where's Martha?
No. What happened... no one expected it.
Only my share.
You're not like him at all. I don't know exactly what's going on around here lately, but don't make me start worrying about you.
Not much, I think.
Nobody worried about your father.
A man should have a hobby.
Is your time so empty?
I'm looking for a private island.
We should have asked for Cabin One... The one Mary was in.
Lenny... shutup. Just park your mouth and listen. It's a set-up. Think about it! Why's he been sending you tapes? To freak you, get you to rush in without thinking. Then they put one in you, put one in her, put the gun in your hand... crime of passion. This guy's bent enough to think of that.
Okay.
Oh, come on.
You're so nice.
I guess I'll see you around the orchards. Thanks for everything.
I love you, Wally.
Norman? Where's Norman?
Norman!
If she was dangerous before--
I am not leaving without him. Do you hear me? We come down as a team, we leave as a team.
My mother took this course with you at UCLA... quot;The Foundations of Poetic Thought quot;.
'Ola!
Not if your ambition is to get high and watch TV.
Nothing. There are just too many people here.
Of course not.
No -- I like it.
I would have these -- I don't know how to describe them -- visions, when I was younger. Maybe not visions, but like these waking dream states. Time would just collapse, I would be inside time. I would stare at a second hand on a clock until it stopped. Freaky stuff.
Much better.
Seven, eight. So one day my mother catches me sort of staring off into space, and she asks me what I'm doing, and I start trying to explain to her, about this state that I can put myself in, and this look comes over her face.
Thinking what you were doing and saying, just being consumed by thinking of you. I loved it so much, that feeling.
I know that trick! He wants to belittle me. He's trying to get my price down. I've waited twenty years for this call. Now Mr. deMille can wait till I'm good and ready.
How do you like that? We've made twelve pictures together. His greatest successes.
Say that I'm busy, and hang up.
Certainly it's important. It's important enough for Mr. deMille to call me personally. The idea of having an assistant call me!
Where would I go?
You're still here.
No... You've always been crazy. This is just the first chance you've had to really express yourself.
I guess I went a little crazy, huh?
You too, sweetie, the best.
You're a good friend.
How do you stay so positive?
I guess everything we've got to lose is already gone anyway.
Unbearable, I'd imagine.
I guess everything from here on in is going to be pretty shitty.
What?!
Louise!
There's only one person in the world to decide what I'm going to do - and that's me. And if you think - if any of you think -
No.
I don't think so. Are you coming, Charles?
Oh yes, there is.
You feel sorry for Solaris, or for me?
I'm not interested in the voters of this state right now. I am interested in - well, Junior, for one thing.
I suppose so, but - I'm not afraid of the story. You can't tell me that the voters of this state -
Sartorius wants to destroy it.
He has a point.
Go on! Get out! I can fight this thing all alone!
You decided what you were going to do, Charles - some time ago. You can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened. Come on, Charles.
So...the station is empty?
Thank you.
Okay.
Okay. And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing.
You promise?
-- You stand there and tell me it is my duty ... after all you promised me!
I was once. Richard!? Richard Norvik? I didn't recognize you.
You'd know better'n me.
I'm still sick, but I'm better.
How many victims are up there?
Now, tell the truth, aren't you a bit disappointed?... But I already told you...
You know, I don't love anybody.
I would say he's pretty depraved.
Oh no; quite the contrary. He's really just a child.
He amuses me. I don't know of anything more amusing. Outside of this jigsaw puzzle. Don't you find it so, Claudia?
I don't know.
You sure?
It's all right.
Not exactly. It's certainly huge.
Stop! You aren't getting rid of me with one fuckin' suitcase!
That's not what I hear.
Not at all. It taught me a little sense. I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader...
What do I have to do to stop it?
That's what you get flight pay for.
I'm being a pain, huh?
No, it isn't your fault. The walls here are just so thin.
Are they really?
I'm fine. Really.
Good guess.
Nothing.
Pretty much. One day at a time.
Yes. Hic!
Yeah, see, I'm kind of a night person, so I was wondering if it wasn't a terrible inconvenience if you could wait a bit before using power tools.
Oh, I'm sorry --
My pleasure ... but to be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive here. I was wondering if I could ask a small favor?
A favor?
We're thinking of doing this current affairs thing for schools. World history since 1945. Twelve programmes, lots of stock film.
You're so famous now.
So it's all worked out perfectly...
Some snowy night in front of the fire... in the meantime, while we're on the subject, will you check about the hors d'oeuvres? The caterer forgot them, the varnish wasn't dry or something...
I will not hear any more about my safety!! You made me a promise and now you have broken it!
Get back inside the town and see if the English are attacking from the other side!
I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
Watch this!
Why?
Very nice. Unless it caved in, too.
Calvin?!
We looked all over for you. What are you doing back here?
It makes me weepy just to remember it. So we were fine again, and then she got married to Matthew who's a womaniser and a bit of a yob, but quite nice really, makes TV commercials. What about yours.
Mummy and I, we were more like lovers, really, or sisters. Then a couple of years after Daddy died, and not long after I left Oxford, she started seeing various men and I was furious. I really was upset. I stopped going home. I never phoned. I went round telling everyone how awful her books were. And she hardly seemed to notice, and that made me angrier. Then I got a job I was interested in, and I started to see lots of men, and I suppose I grew up a little and began to understand. So I wrote her a long letter, almost seven pages, saying how sorry I was, and how I was worried that we were drifting apart. And do you know, she wrote me a poem, a really beautiful poem about mothers and daughters.
So, whaddya think?
It's fine.
Damn. They're early.
That must be rather nice, in a way. I mean, you don't have any--
He did. Captain Renault did.
No.
Monsieur Rick, what kind of man is Captain Renault?
No, I mean, is he trustworthy? Is his word --
My husband is with me, too.
You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor.
That was my companion. She sings little peasant songs quite nicely -- a completely untrained voice, of course.
Who is it?
What happened?
You know this CITIZEN KANE picture? About Pops and everything?
No, no.
That's exactly what I told Mr. Reed, but he insisted upon remaining home from business to talk to you, Miss Callahan.
What?
You scare me.
I... accept your proposal!
Nor I!
Excuse me?
Think we're going to do it? Think we're going to war?
Where are you going?
Where'd you come from?
I was?
You're father thinks it's okay to run off to Cancun with a blonde bimbo in a halter top. Somehow his opinion doesn't count.
Forget it.
My point exactly. See, we both agree.
I took the padlock off your door. What more do you want?
I should've known...
I'm the stenographer.
Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff?
No. Like a man.
Sure.
No.
I'm sorry, but I can't tonight. I'm meeting somebody.
You mean tonight?
Who's Norma?
Don't you sometimes hate yourself?
Shhh.
What's good about it? I miss him something fierce.
Money!
Later?
What - again?
I could watch you play that last scene a thousand times and cry every time-
Not unless you hear my confession.
350 pounds.
This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
You kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, Sam? All that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know I was tightly wound--
No, it wasn't, was it? You didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?
Not unless you hear my confession.
"I only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." Then he tells me I can't be in the box anymore if I can't control myself. Sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the TV now and then. I do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.
Uh-uh.
Wyatt...
Well, when I first came to Washington, my eyes were big, blue question marks-- now they're big, green dollar marks--
I saw an article...
We have to find the dog, Ryan.
So why are you telling me this?
What the hell am I doing wrong? Just because Jake is training, I can't go out? What am I, a goddamn prisoner?
You're implying th...
I'm not doing anything wrong. I'm just trying to have a good time. Do I have to be cooped up in the house all the time?
Ew, it's like some gross rat...
Gross!
His name's Wally Brown .... great guy. Been in the business since forever.
How did you see me?
Unfeasible.
'Gratulations, Gina. It's so goddamn wonderful.
Yeah, well, you're here now -- -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen.
No, never. Excuse me.
Yes.
One letter in five years...I read it till the paper dried up and the writing faded out...
Oh, no, Alvy, please. Alvy, please. M'mrnm.
Look again!
Isn't this a fabulous picture?
I'd ask you to take me home, but I'm a faceless sinner. ...You smell good, Harry. Familiar, you know? I'd ask you to take me home, but...
Well... you're looking well.
How did I look?
Dad, too. I sold the house. I'm a faceless sinner, Harry...
I got a new car. Only it's red. Did you know Mama died?
The both of you.
I don't know what happened to you, Jack ... but I can't believe you were always this much of a bastard.
Tell it like it is.
He's very caring, in his way. You haven't seen him at his best.
It was nice having you "watch over me"...
I'll miss you, Mike...
Good night, Mike.
Please don't raise your voice. I won't bother you about it again.
Am I that close to Fairvale?
I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
Los Angeles.
I thought I'd gotten off the main...
Great! Great! Goddammit! Ooooh! These are... p-p-p-pick this lobster up. Hold it, please!
It'll make great- Alvy, be- Alvy, it'll be wonderful... Ooooh, lovely!
All right. All right. All right.
Yeah. I'm gonna get my... I'm gonna get my camera.
Ha! Thank you! See? He did it. He left.
He wanted to know if I liked fried chicken.
And, anyway, you sell yourself short. I can tell. There's a lot of stuff going on in your brain. I can tell. My goal... can I tell you my goal?
What's the goal, Joel? My goal, Joel, is to just let it flow through me? Do you know what I mean? It's like, there's all these emotions and ideas and they come quick and they change and they leave and they come back in a different form and I think we're all taught we should be consistent. Y'know? You love someone -- that's it. Forever. You choose to do something with your life -- that's it, that's what you do. It's a sign of maturity to stick with that and see things through. And my feeling is that's how you die, because you stop listening to what is true, and what is true is constantly changing. You know?
You're really nice. I'm sorry I yelled at you before about it. God, I'm an idiot.
I like you. That's the thing about my psychic thing. I think that's my greatest psychic power, that I get a sense about people. My problem is I never trust it. But I get it. And with you I get that you're a really good guy.
Like I wanted to talk to you. I didn't need any more reason to do it. Who knows what bigger cosmic reason might exist?
Yes, I'm sure you could - but I can't risk you loosing your job
Uh... Duke.
Are they going to work here too?
Such a gentlemen when you're scared shitless.
Have you heard from Judith's parents?
Uh... It's... uh... generally considered desirable in the publishing business to... ah... take certain license in depicting the cover scene... for... ah... purposes involving the... ah, market place.
I can't wait till Pony gets here, you know? Have a conversation with a human being?
Really? How flattering! Did you try the shrimp puffs?
We're actresses.
Oh, in this we're a big hit. Yesterday I auditioned for Come Back Little Sheba. That, I wasn't such a big hit.
Where's egghead?
I don't know. It's hard figuring you two as brothers. Seems like the hospital might've scrambled the babies somewhere.
I tried him, he can't go. His son is being Bar Mitzvohed tomorrow... I'll go, boss.
What are you doing in this shit-hole town?
... I'm... ... I'm very grateful that you're here, Chauncey... ... With us ...
... But he's...?
He's a very private person, actually.
What's that supposed to mean?
They sure liked them devilled eggs.
The teddy bear?
Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed!
Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat.
Don't know where I learn't it, but... it's there in my head.
Yes, so do we.
Well, we can talk about it.
What's your problem?
What's that?
Is that why you're still here?
Jerry, these flowers aren't really for me
You buy the typewriter, I'll get it all spruced up, good as new. Better than new. It has some history.
Sort of, funny boy. If I tell him the meeting's on you're to go to the top of Beachwood Canyon. There's a corral up there where he'll be.
It's been a very strange day.
Something tells me this guy is connected with what's happening, Adam, and I think you should do it and I think you should do it right away.
Yeah, the Cowboy. This guy, the Cowboy, wants to see you. Jason said he thought it would be a good idea.
Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place.
Well, I for one, am glad of a little diversion and I'm glad they're here...
You're the advisor. You should stop her. She's not qualified. She's just a sophomore.
Will you meet with him?
We have to go back!
After he tried to shoot you?
Who else is paying for all this? You badmouth the woman all the time, but you sure do take the payoffs she gives you.
Exactly because I know this is a time when you need to be alone with your thoughts. 86.
Yeah -- guess I got revved up at the idea of an evening among adults -- no offense buster. You meet Chad the nanny?
Well, Steve?
But they must have. Amy and I made them out together. You mailed them, didn't you, Edward?
Are we leaving?
Oilie, that's for the children to play with.
All right, Ollie. Go ahead. Call the Boyds...3000W...see if their darling Donald has left.
That's right.
What do you mean?
Yes, for your hair.
I've been sitting over there for forty- five minutes waiting for you to come talk to me. But I'm just tired now and I have to go home and I wasn't going to keep sitting there waiting for you.
Try this. I found a great jar of it. Olive oil. In Naples this was so precious it would have bought you a wife.
When was this?
Well, do you think many people run around thinking about how happy they feel and how great things are? I mean, maybe they do, but I doubt those people are in therapy. Besides, being happy isn't all that great. My figure is always at its best when I'm depressed. The last time I was really happy I put on twenty-five pounds. I thought John was going to have a stroke.
I just can't, James. I can't do it.
I can't tonight.
Well, this weekend John was taking out the garbage, and he kept spilling things out of the container, and I started imagining a container that grew garbage, like it just kept filling up and overflowing all by itself, and how could you stop that if it started happening?
Don't you think that's a lot of garbage? I'd really like to know where it's all going to go.
Yeah, so?
What do you mean?
I think while we're waiting, we had better run some basic diagnostics on you.
I'm not!
I need to talk to you alone.
Yes.
No.
Can too.
He lost all the weight... there.
You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
Don't worry - Is that my hammer Well Just make sure that it's put back in the garage...
I must say this certainly has Been an unexpected little Windfall.
Oh! Are you really?
Am I supposed to say 'thank you'?
Aw, shucks, ma'am. T'weren't nothin'.
It ain't for lack of trying.
Why, Doctor! We've only just met!
God. You're a real live outlaw!
And smooth, boy, you are smooth.
You're kinda the best thing that's happened to me in a long time.
About coming in. Your mother just phoned and said you were on your way over to pay me a visit.
Didn't you tell her?
Yeah, so I noticed. Have you made up your mind?
Always?
Yes, Will. I didn't even know that?
I want you to stay and find Wynant.
You're unbelievable.
Let's not fumble for excuses, not here and now with my hair down. At best, let's say I've been oversensitive to... well, to the fact that she's so young - so feminine and helpless. To so many things I want to be for Bill... funny business, a woman's career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder, so you can move faster. You forget you'll need them again when you go back to being a woman. That's one career all females have in common - whether we like it or not - being a woman. Sooner or later we've all got to work at it, no matter what other careers we've had or wanted... and, in the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner or turns around in bed - and there he is. Without that, you're not woman. You're something with a French provincial office or a book full of clippings - but you're not a woman... ... slow curtain. The end.
Margo. Margo, I want you to know how sorry I am about this...
About what?
This. I can't tell you how sorry I am!
Don't give it another thought, one of destiny's many pranks. After all, you didn't personally drain the gasoline out of the tank...
Want a drink?
All right. You see that guy over there? His name is Sport. Go talk to him. I'll wait here.
You looking for some action?
Hey I'm over here.
I'll bet he never jerks off...
See, we're getting along famously!
Back to California
I don't know...
I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work.
I didn't forget. I was up all night thinking about it and I concluded you're too special to look like everyone else. Orange Red. That's your color. Few can carry it off. Now please. Help me find your brother.
You lost Ben?!
You forgot to wash my purple shirt. I told you a hundred times it was Purple Day at school today.
But Hollywood. You mustn't stay there.
So few come back...
Then why? Why, if you're the best and most successful young director in the Theater-
I just asked a simple question.
Not at all.
Every fuse in my nervous system has been blown.
He's not in. But he's working on it. He said to tell you.
A small, "calico" kitten, sir. "Calico."
So be it. It looks serious this time, though. All these guns... are you actually prepared to kill and die for whooping cranes?
Looks like every time we get together things are in a mess.
What's your name?
What???
I wonder if I could take just a minute of your time here -
You never know.
I don't know.
I don't know. But this isn't a dream. I'm real, and so is where we are.
No.
It's Sunday.
I live alone.
Romeo, I drink to thee.
No, the reason I ask is--
Really?
No, you're not in my class.
Here's your class.
I love secrets.
In basic English, what does all this mean?
Don't worry about them. They're at that party, getting drunk and falling all over each other and making jokes about McGovern and stuff.
I've read it twice, Norman. It's brilliant.
Want a drink?
Huh? Do you mind if I sit down - I'm carrying quite a load here.
I mean, that'd be too creepy. With us working together and all.
Hey, listen. You're not going soft on me, are you? I mean, you're not gonna start dreaming about me and waking up all sweaty and looking at me like I'm some kinda princess when I burp.
No. Thanks. She starts to move away, then stops and looks back.
No - not yet.
Nothing personal --
Fix?
You're. Acting. Like your father.
Get it out of here!
Yes, I did.
Overall - pretty good. But, Mr. President, I think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.
I sympathize with your position, Mr. President, I know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.
You will be discreet about this?
We didn't know we were compromised. Firing would only've given away our position.
No. Yes. I mean, depends on --
Oh please. I can't have you do that.
I'm sorry.
Ugh.
I'm going to take a big bath and order a big meal.
I'm sorry... are you okay?
Can you believe in our little mix you're the good roommate.
Since you workin' on the square now, maybe we could get some coffee in the morning, if you want.
Got in a little accident.
I put on the lotion you got me. Can you smell it?
No. That's not why... Why we always gotta do this? I mean, you and me been at each other as far back as I can remember. Wasn't no love between us. And I'm your daughter. I'm the only family you got.
O honey nurse, what news? Nurse?
You really think there's a treasure inside?
Excellency!
When I was little, in church.
Can I take your picture?
People are going to know who's responsible. And they're going to get the news - the true news - quickly and simply and entertainingly. And no special interests will be allowed to interfere with the truth of that news.
I'll write it myself.
These'll be kept. I'll provide the people of this city with a daily paper that will tell all the news honestly. I will also provide them -
I've changed the front page a little, Mr. Bernstein. That's not enough - There's something I've got to get into this paper besides pictures and print - I've got to make the "New York Enquirer" as important to New York as the gas in that light.
My Declaration of Principles - Don't smile, Brad - Take dictation, Mr. Bernstein -
Uh huh.
It's nothing of the kind! Lloyd loves me, I love him!
Why not?
Someone gave him more money than we could.
Are you going to quit? My last bodyguard quit.
Addison...
Being black, is that a positive or negative for a bodyguard in Mexico?
I didn't mean just the Theater.
Oh Coco thank you. Thank you so much.
Let me got! Where are you taking me?
He does this every year?
Dr. Lunacharsky...?
Just relax.
His name was Jimmy.
Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting.
Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry...
Well, I try and talk to him, but mostly he's the one who does the talking.
Well... maybe someone is, like... giving you these dream steroids. And sleepwalking ...is someone showing you the way.
He went to meet somebody and didn't come back.
Graham and I were talking about apartments and I told him to check the Garden District, there are some nice little places there, garage apartments and stuff.
Wasn't Daddy wonderful? He wanted to kiss her some more and play with her, but he didn't, because he loves Mother and all of us, and he loves Rose, too. Isn't he wonderful, isn't he great?
Who's Elizabeth?
Oh, we get along okay. She's just very... she's an extrovert. I think she's loud. She probably wouldn't agree. Definitely wouldn't agree.
Oh, please... you get that out of a fortune cookie?
I know I made things worse. I know that and I'm sorry, but Arnie I need something from you. Something only you can help me with.
Who is he?
I've got to find a bathroom. I'll call you.
Please.
Okay. Okay.
He's been living out of moving boxes for three months.
And it can't be forged?
When Mom died you told me God wanted her more, loved her more --
Sometimes I wonder what they talk about.
Yeah.
This will last you one year after which you have the option to renew if... you like at a membership discount.
...Paulie. Stop now!
Free?
Sure. You make art and you want people to see it.
Yes, you do.
You do.
Huh?
Because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil Sunny.
Coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.
Mama?
What about you? What happened to you?
Who?
Sure, why?
Take them back, Suzette.
Please go back, bring the children to us.
I'd say this is slightly different.
What's that?
You're gonna need somebody, someone's gotta be around for you, boy... ... You oughta find yourself a lady, Chance... But I guess it oughta be an old lady, 'cause you ain't gonna do a young one any good, not with that little thing of yours... ... You're always gonna be a little boy, ain't you? ... Goodbye, Chance...
I'm not gonna mention Ricky to him.
Nobody stole my credit cards. They burned up in the crash. Which reminds me, did you get me cash? And what about the reservations?
Is it December?
And why should continuing excellence cost more?
Like...?
Fine. You want to help Ricky, talk to Maxie yourself.
Did Christmas come early this year...?
Leonard does not hold a driving licence. As for his passport, I do not know where he keeps it.
What? No, of course not.
I don't know where he is.
I told you I'm looking for someone.
Slow down, slow down.
And don't send your guys down there to stop me! I mean it.
I'm going to the bank and I'm getting my jewelry too!
This is important to me.
What?
Fine. I'm takin' Amy.
Haven't you had enough of us, Dad?
No, I like him.
I don't like you.
Okay, darling.
It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
I suppose so. He sits there all he time, doing some silly opera.
You don't know what it's like. Herr Mozart frightens me. He drinks all day, then takes all that medicine and it makes him worse.
I don't know. He has pains.
Here, in his stomach. They bend him right over.
I'm frightened, sir. Really! When he speaks, he doesn't make any sense. You know he said he saw - he said he saw his father. And his father's dead.
Do you have your masters?
I wouldn'tve asked --
I'm sorry.
Psychology major?
And you ended up at UC Berkely --
I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but...
I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
I'm sorry about --
It was everything.
-- I guess you haven't.
Never tried, 'til now. Joe, may I kiss you?
You want us to come with you? I just have to run to the main house and give Mr. Peterson a check.
They need to see the new 484's to make sure it works with their OC....
Probably. She's on the phone twenty- three hours a day.
I know. I know. I know. I just wanna chew your face and scoop out your beautiful, beautiful eyes with an ice cream scooper and eat 'em and chew 'em and suck on 'em. Fuck.
Yeah.
For when I travel?
A puppy's got a little more personality than a fish.
He's your cute thing.
I'll wear a bloody kimono if I want to.
Were you badly hurt? I think we saw each other at the hospital. I don't want the car. In fact, I was appalled to find that I have to pay a small fee to have it scrapped.
Not yet - though not soon enough for some people, I've already found. A death in the doctor's family makes the patients doubly uneasy.
Haven't I? To the airport, if you could.
Isn't that her picture?
Very simple, Earl.
No, Earl, not at all. Who sent you the flowers, Earl?
Is that how you came to shoot the policeman?
You matter to me. Completely.
Well, what do you do? Do-do-do you talk to Holly, or Lee, or what? Do you, do you, do you phone them?
Do you talk to Holly or Lee behind my back? Do you? You must. They- they seem to know so much about us.
I'm sorry. I hated to take your money, but --
I believe you. I really do.
The baby?
The scandal...
You went to the room to help with the birth.
She didn't want any help.
You wanted that child out of the way.
That's a lie.
You hid the wastepaper basket in her room.
I didn't hide it. I put it there for the blood and the dirty sheets.
And the baby.
No!
So... for how long do we have to...
Well -- how come?
Why would we go to Odessa?
Llewelyn --
Darling, no father could be nicer to a child than you are to Amy.
Does he know you know?
Just shut up?
I'm sorry. I haven't been very fair to you. That's why I came here to the store this evening. I feel terrible, Rob. This is really hard, you know.
What's the obvious stuff?
That's not true.
No.
I don't know.
I have a confession to make. Someone gave me six-hundred dollars to spill drinks on you, as a practical joke.
Far as I'm concerned, whatever you did in the past can stay in the past.
I am.
Did you bring that tape?
I did too!
God, it's so weird that we're finally out of high school... We've been waiting for this our whole life! Now we can get our own apartment and do anything we want. It's such a weird feeling.
I know, it hasn't really hit me yet.
You're late, asshole.
Oh, thank you, thank you so much!
Well I know he's come here before.
Thirteen. The last time, can you believe it? This is how he says "Goodbye?"
I didn't know what else to do...
Peter...Peter Kelson.
I can t believe you want to move back into the city. I thought the reason we left was because we didn t want to raise the kids here?
Come on, Josh... don't you want to see where he lives?
And this is Helen Carter.
This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
You have a blind grandfather. One day you're going to invent a machine that reads books for blind people. I read about it. You're going to be famous. You're going to invent a lot of things.
Because I'm telling you the truth. I know what's going to happen. There's going to be test tube babies and heart transplants. And an American named Neil Armstrong is going to walk on the moon. On July 20, 1969.
Yes, Yes I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that I, that --
No, Victor, there isn't.
Be careful.
I don't like it at all. You had a wonderful character before, the Gambler. He was so romantic.
Is that your idea of a winner? He doesn't give a shit about anyone. He uses people and --
I don't give a fuck about the sex. Most men'll fuck a lamppost. He's just a miserable zombie. Is that the way you feel now? Is that what's happened to you?
Oh really. Then why is he called Jake. Why don't you come clean and call him Jack. There's no hope in it.
Without hope there's no point to anything.
Dad... Dad... Who was that? How do you know him? He looked familiar. Have I met him?
Money is no object. He's got cards up the wazoo.
So, what are you seeing?
Exactly. You understand that, don't you? You have no chance of meeting a woman dressed like that.
It's divine!
I won't play tonight. I couldn't. Not possibly. I couldn't go on...
I think three...
Oh, come on, come on!
The FBI found something that belonged to my son. A sandal... Anyway, John was upset. He... he...
It wasn't a suicide attempt. I regret ever saying that.
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son. Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy. That's why I left him. And now you can leave.
He shot a hole in the damn ceiling. So what? You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.
Take it easy. The glass is bullet resistant.
It's okay, Lenny They'd never get here in time anyway.
This is bad.
Lenny. Calm down. This is what I do.
Lousy. And I have siesta hair. I'm thinking of canceling the speech.
It's lunchtime, and I wanna have a talk with you, Nathan Lee. Come on, children...
Should we bring the police into this?
Leave me alone. I haven't touched anything in months.
What's with him?
Maybe love shouldn't be such hard work. I know, but --
For defending my honor this afternoon.
The first and the last.
We've got to rescue him.
Paul's only twelve years old.
And maybe Paul. What about the murderers? They're in there!
I'm amazed.
Why would you do that?
I don't wanna talk to you.
Yeah, yeah right -- what the fuck are doing? WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING IN MY HOUSE?
Yes... That's the first thing Colleen asked too.
He wasn't drinking. Ray fell asleep at the wheel.
See Father, Ray's truck swerved off the road and ah... Hit Colleen and then a tree. She was pinned between the two.
She's not in an ambulance Father.
The truck... the truck has severed most of her lower half.
Fine. And here's a kiss for you.
Dad, I love him.
Right now?
Who's Sophie?
Well, for later then.
I don't know... I did... feel different... Alive.
What do you mean? Where do you think?
He ain't Spalding.
Ok. Maybe I'll walk down with you.
Like it. Almost there.
How about a plane?
Back to Mexico.
Where can we go?
Go on then! Pa's in the barn saddlin' the Fort Worth stud... an' you can take the light gelding with the blaze...
Is someone there?
Without that navicam looks to me like you forfeit the right to be in charge.
I'm the one's got the big stick.
What do you want to do?
I think it's because my heart starts pounding when I see you.
That's all I need from you. That's more than I could ever ask for. You're just golden, dude.
Okay.
Oh Jabez! And we were counting on ... It's a lovely calf.
About sex?
Jabez!
You said you weren't always impotent.
So you have had sex.
Who was the last person you had sex with?
So what happened? Was it so bad that it turned you off?
What was the problem?
Oh, yeah, it was a great show. You guys missed it.
Wow. I'm losing it.
What do I say? What can I say? No. At least, not yet. I don't know... I can't even think of it... at a time like this... Oh, but why did you have to ask me?
And why did you drop them?
I'm sure you'd be able to design some very lovely things.
What! Get married?
What about sex?
You mean the designs for the nanobot? You think after this I'm going to give them to him?
I know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it.
Not yet. What do you know about it?
He's coming over here!
How do you do.
Yeah, I know.
I had a checklist in mind. I thought that if babies were on the plane, the plane couldn't crash. But all the babies were crying, and I thought they knew something I didn't.
And then you got up and you told them to turn the plane around.
It's just a little casino inspection, don't trip, he's alone. Alright, let's set this spinnin'...
A Fed? Like FBI?
I'mma grip and rip girl. I got some handloads here ready to cut heads.
When them tricks hit the lobby, holla at me and I'm gonna meet them on the way up, blend in. Once I get inside, I'mma put m'Nina to Israel's head and back out hot. Anybody's fucks with that program, y'break 'em off. They get gully --
...Girl, y'know I had to bring big mamma through.
Jus' remember, this is more rescuin' shit than rampagin' shit... What are you shootin'?
The try t'wild out on my boo and it's on and crackin'! I'm layin' niggas out.
You got the fifty up? Bitch y'tryin' t'take down a jumbo jet? Blown the moon out the sky? T'fuck you wanna get that grimy?
Damn, this kevlar ridin' up on me, I wish they made this more sheer.
Hi, Adam. This is, uh....
C'mon Lloyd.
Are you sure we should be doing this?
You said never to touch you before a fight.
You said I couldn't. You've been good for two weeks...
I don't know what to say. It's beautiful.
I don't understand, where are you taking me?
Why are you doing all this for me?
Yes -- I'd love to.
Why?
You're not a bit like you were yesterday.
Oh -- there's no real thing -- it doesn't exist.
Anything for you.
He's not, he's...
We're from Channel Four, yes. We'd like to find --
Ah, Charley and I are...Well, we're thinking about...I mean, actually we're sort of talking about maybe getting back together.
Where... can I stay?
Creasy... Wait.
You're lying. I don't believe you.
I don't believe you.
Do I know you?
Hey...
I came flying up here expecting to get some explanation... for all I know, she may be trying to get in touch with me, at home. I'd better go home.
You have enough worries of your own.
No. Fred hates them.
But it could be anywhere.
The money? The money's gone.
We're almost there, Violet. just hang on.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you have to do is break down, go to your bedroom and pack some things, start crying, saying you love him but you can't do it. You're sorry but you have to leave and just walk out.
okay, all right.
To James. I remember what it was I was going to say. We were talking about forgetfulness. The Czech writer Kundera has one of his characters say that the struggle of man against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting.
If you want me to -
I think you can learn whatever you want to. I just don't see you doing it. If you want to settle for--
Save your breath. That line doesn't cut it with me.
And I'd like you to call me Ann.
I sent a letter to Doug today. I'll be so glad when he gets out here.
If it's so fuckin' dangerous, then why don't you kill him?
All right! Here's another one. 'The most satisfactory lovemaking occurs when your mate climaxes first, you climax first, you and your mate climax together?'
I swear, Sidney, I can't help it - sometimes I wonder what I see in you...
You're right. Probably penis, mouth and neck.
Good luck to you too, Paul.
Yeah.
I'm making you a steak.
Thanks. I will.
I don't want to hear about your fucking dreams!
Dear Miss Laury...I take pen in hand to let you know Ethan and me still are trying to catch up with them Com- anches the late Mister Futterman told us about...
Yeah. Deja vu.
Thanks. But guess who was there auditioning?
I wanted to apologize.
I love you.
Right. I'm sorry.
I need morphine. A lot. And a pistol.
Karl, you better clap your hands or he'll just keep on.
Then have a donut --
Oh, God. Oh, God. Okay. Okay... I'll try. I'll try.
Yes.
So some psycho wire-freak gets to keep running around--
Take the tape to the cops.
This guy is someone you know, one of your squid-head contacts.
Maybe he just figures Lenny will appreciate what he's created. It's the dark end of the street, Lenny. How do you like it now?
Cause you're the man, right? The Magic Man. If it's got something to do with the wire, sooner or later it washes up on your beach.
Ed, you're still young. This is the part of your life when you're supposed to be struggling.
Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
Oh.
What do you mean?
Why not now?
Yeah, it would be kinda great.
Oh, but I'm not due to have the baby for another six weeks or so.
But Dad'll never go for it.
It would be fantastic.
This is interesting - are you ready for this? Oswald went to see the FBI two weeks before the assassination. It seems Special Agent Hosty made three routine visits to his house, supposedly to keep an eye on Marina Oswald.
Spend a year in the Peace Corps. Make a medical discovery --
I said fine.
Oh, really? Oh, well... uh, uh, maybe, uh, maybe, we, uh...
Yeah, right, Duane-and over there is Grammy Hall, and that's Sadie.
Oh... oh, well, you see now now, uh, that's my dad, that's Father-and that's my... brother, Duane.
Narcolepsy, right, right. Right. So, anyway, so... George, uh, went to the union, see, to get his free turkey, be-because, uh, the union always gave George this big turkey at Christmas time because he was... shell-shocked, you know what I mean, in the First World War. Anyway, so, so... George is standing in line, oh, just a sec... uh, getting his free turkey, but the thing is, he falls asleep and he never wakes up. So, so... so, he's dead ... he's dead. Yeah. Oh, dear. Well, terrible, huh, wouldn't you say? I mean, that's pretty unfortunate.
Sadie? Oh, well, Sadie... Sadie met Grammy through, uh, through Grammy's brother George. Uh, George was real sweet, you know, he had that thing. What is that thing where you, uh, where you, uh, fall asleep in the middle of a sentence, you know-what is it? Uh...
I don't know, Dad doesn't either.
Get out of my house. You re fired, Mr Lombard.
Sure.
We'll withdraw support completely. Anything else?
Because I can't.
No! Don't!
Eighty-eight dollars ain't gonna make a dent, baby girl.
Prude.
Know what you are?! You're a prude, Roper.
Aaargh!! I'm freezing!
We've only got one suit.
How?
Calm down, Bud.
I don't know, look around.
Oh, yes you will, Ann dear . . . you're very clever.
He looked like one of the Monkees.
Yeah, I know. What are you looking for?
Why not?
You want to talk? Come on, Jack... Did I cross the line by mentioning the future or what?
Juliet!
I guess I wanted to.
I'm glad you did.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.
So am I.
Well, so glad you decided to come.
What for? I gave you fifty just the other day.
I don't know. I'm not sure.
I suppose.
Yes -- he mentioned it.
He said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. That his heart couldn't take it.
Yes. I suppose it's possible.
That son of a bitch, everything he says is a phony piece of shit, what does he think, I'm some cigar butt he's got between his teeth --
He just completely ignores me. He could have at least said something, introduced me or something.
Thanks, Bobby. And my little round friends, too.
Dad, maybe I shouldn't go with all that's happening to you.
It doesn't feel right to me. I, I don't even have the right luggage yet.
I -- I didn't really pay much attention-- Bobby has such an active imagination.
I brought it to you in the hospital.
I can't find that charm Daddy gave me from India.
Would you excuse me?
It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no?
I should turn them off. Maybe I sing him a lullaby my mama sang to me when I was a little girl.
Coincidence, yes? And how is our son?
Shall we close up, then?
Oui.
Hey! What are you guys doing in here?
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I see. I guess-
Cute, Evan.
Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is.
...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, "If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded."
Jake, what is that?
Are you glad? I'm glad.
Lock it - and keep it locked.
Raymond -
Do you like poetry, Raymond?
Mrs. Kane liked poetry -
I didn't say anything special, I was just talking out loud.
Dolores. No one calls me 'Mrs. Driscoll'.
Will, sit down...
There's something I have to tell you both. It's going to sound strange...
My name hasn't always been Keri Tate. It was once Laurie Strode.
She lives here too?
But...are you engaged or something?
Sounds like you have a fear of commitment, Uncle Phil.
Committed?
So does that mean that you sleep here every night?
He owns it. You know?
What did he say? What did he say?
You didn't tell me.
Do? To who?
This is where you live?
I don't know why I'm so scared, Joe. Is it something awful?
Whose?
Whose house is it?
That was Norma Desmond on the phone?
Good. We need you healthy and relaxed. You're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.
No.
Okay, okay...
I -- I cleaned up my room, look... and I said my prayers... all of them... and...
You can't stop it, Norman. You can't fight me.
Don't listen to him, little sister. When you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?
Yes, Ma.
Remember the night we broke the windows in this old house? This is what I wished for.
No.
Always.
Yes.
What?
Oh? Anything I might have seen?
Marty...
No...
No...
Marty...
Yes.
Why did you come tonight? To see me?
Yes -- she did.
Good luck, Buzz.
Charlie, how are you?
Rob. Please focus.
All right, all right.. I shouldn't 've asked you.
Wh-wh-when confronted by superior numbers, the experienced gunfighter will fire on the best shots first.
You don't have to explain. You have every right to come.
Yeah, there's another hit left.
It's right on Hawthorne Boulevard and Manhattan Beach Boulevard. It's red brick...
Oh yeah? What was happenin' there?
Yes.
Why do you have Dickie's rings?
Why? When?
I was looking for a needle and thread. I wasn't snooping. I was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.
I don't believe you.
Oh take it! Please take it!
After he moved out, I invited him to every practice, every game, every parent-teacher conference you ever had. He didn't show, not once.
Well, make it stop!
Well, set down and I'll make some biscuits and gravy.
I... I had a visitor.
Oh, Jesus. I can't explain. It's... it's. I don't know how to help! I have to save him and I don't know how to help!
I know. No-one can. But I have to save him. Where's the other doctor? He said He'd listen. He promised.
Help. No, no-one can help. I just want someone to listen or I WILL go crazy.
"I had forgotten this. I had somehow remembered it being more his fault, his decision. Then I remembered we made love in that field before we left for home. And I remembered it was my idea. I remembered tearing his shirt and biting his body, hoping he would kidnap me. I had forgotten that too. And I wondered, as I sat there... how many other things I'd forgotten."
Good luck, genius...
Waal, I gotta tell you. I've been inside the Beltway fourteen years, and I feel like I Just Got My Feet Wet.
What did you say, Brother?
I don't know.
That's what it cost, David.
I was just thinking... There's something special I want to talk to you about. I think it's time we went to a whole other phase in our relationship. A deeper level.
You've changed you know. I don't think there's anything you can't do once you put your mind to it.
Scottie?
Things have been going pretty well between us, haven't they?
Ya hope I don't keep acting like a whore or I'll turn into one, right?
-- cause she's going to be very, very expensive.
Lester.
So you think we got 'em scared?
That is amazing. What year is it?
What's that about?
How well do you know this boy, Seth, who was driving? You know the police have charged him with a DUI and possession of marijuana.
Me, too.
Honey, this is difficult, but we've all had our moments. I tried --
Pardon me-- this is. Where are we now?
A committee of the majority party leaders. They decide when a Bill is important enough to be moved up toward the head of the list--
Pardon?
Yes--sure. Why not? You don't mind if I take the time to get a pencil?
Jimmy. I don't know. I got so much else on my mind. I got the kids. We got no money.
I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here.
Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan.
Nathan, what the hell are you talking about?
Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal.
What?
What about Matt ?
Oh God.
No !
You take tuberculosis. My smoking doesn't go over at all.
Well, technically, I have more of a right to be there than you. You still have your balls.
I don't know -- am I?
I Don't know. I don't know if I could live that way. What if, God forbid, you go to prison. Mickey said Jeannie's husband --
I spaced out.
Wait a minute. Your mother's alive.
Well, this expert Dr. Egelhoffer, from New York, decides to make Williams re-enact the crime --
Well, I'm coming to it. It seems the Professor had to have a gun to re- enact the crime with -- and who do you suppose supplied it? Nobody else but that great thinker, Sheriff Hartman!
No, this is on the level, Walter. I'm not good enough to make this one up. The Sheriff gave his gun to the Professor, the Professor gave it to Earl, and Earl gave it right back to the Professor -- right in the stomach! Who? No, Egelhoffer wasn't hurt badly. They took him to the County Hospital where they're afraid he'll recover.
It better be fifteen minutes, because Bruce is waiting downstairs in a taxicab and that meter's clicking away to beat the band.
It was just... more convenient as I was among soldiers...
The clothes are not important...
We're only talking about six weeks.
No. I haven't seen them.
It seems to me that the Church and Our Lord are one and the same. Why must you complicate what is so simple?
Our adopted land...
Do you know what he's been saying to her?
You are the father.
Serve the nuts - I mean, serve the guests the nuts.
So it is the Church Militant that refuses to confess me, and so prevents me from being a good Christian?
He told me everything. I was supposed to meet him fifteen minutes ago, so I... I'm going to go now, I think. Unless he meant us to meet -- which would be a little cruel, wouldn't it?
William, you're not making sense.
Maybe if you didn't go Rambo every time I did a lapdance, you'd still be doing it yourself. Meantime, I gotta feed my little girl.
Think of me as your genie. Just ask.
Dickie was at the Opera last night.
I follow the wires.
Why would anyone do this?
I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
John and Cynthia have been... "fucking".
I don't understand --
No, John, things are getting real simple.
Oh, yes -- office party -- Miss Olsen --
Mr. Baxter -- nineteenth floor.
You were in hell?
I was hoping we could have a special evening.
Did he say that?
Maybe we can stop there for lunch.
Little village down seven. Supposed to be charming.
Do you know it?
Clyde Wynant's crazy... absolutely crazy to stay away at a time like this. No wonder the police think he has something to do with it.
Oh, I know he didn't, but I wish I could find him... I have something very important to tell him. Macaulay won't help at all. He thinks I just want money.
You're always teasing.
Nick, you will help me find Clyde -- won't you?
Yeah. Someone like you who divides his time, fairly evenly, between the batting cages and bars.
That was taken at a place called "Flippers." It was in Hollywood. Were you in L.A. back then?
The beach. Or get high, drop acid at a friend's place. I was a K.L.O.S. girl. I hated disco.
Maxine...
I love you, Lotte.
Oh my darling. Oh my sweetheart.
Yeah.
Oh, my sweet, beautiful Lotte.
I was pretty much the same height now as I was then.
Do you mind?
Noooo, I was a surfer girl. Besides, I was only fourteen. I couldn't go to discos.
Alright, Louise!
No physical evidence. We can't prove he did it. We probably can't even prove he touched you by now.
Besides, what do we say about the robbery? No excuse for that. No such thing as justifiable robbery.
But it wasn't! We got away! We were walkin' away!
They don't know that! It was just you and me there. I'll say he raped me and you had to shoot him! I mean, it's almost the truth!
It won't work.
Why not?!
You might want to pencil in a little face-time with your daughter.
It wasn't much more than a pot boiler.Suez was very important for our generation. I didn't want it to be forgotten. And that's why I'd like to be able to help you. But really Mr. Penfield, I looked through my notes before you came, they're all very much out of date, there's been so much published since. I don't think I'm your man.
I'm not shaving my legs or pits this summer, I've decided.
You're probably the only one who could carry it off.
Carol!
1 just did it for the reunion. I thought it would be fun.
Now Edna says you short-changed your last meds. You can do presents and be comfortable at the same time, y'know.
Oh my God, Jake, no. If it is someone they'll go away. Or call the police. Don't go out there.
What was his name?
How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her?
Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.
But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really.
I believe you. Did that nice doctor let you out? Or is this you improvising again, Grady?
Is he really all right?
Cause I had a bad dream about him. I dreamed he got hit by a car and you and Mr. Crandall buried him in the Pet Sematary.
What happened?
But he's interested!
I'm fine.
Because you promised.
No. But the photo on his license looked familiar. I think he's been in the bar before
Then why do you think I married Frank? I was already pregnant, and I didn't have much time. Say what you like, but at least he gave my kid a name.
Catherine? I'm about to start. If you want me to wait, or...
No. No.
Yes.
I have a tiny apartment.
Of course.
Well, I mean, I'm moving in with you, that's why.
Yeah.
I dunno.
Saw my outfit or something, my coat --
Radio said negative five.
Yeah.
Radio said.
I figured you walked outta there and saw me and walked right the other way --
It's a gift to my people -- and I see MacFarlane and Gray-- the pit yawns for them and the flames -- and I would have you away from them and safe out of the torment.--
You don't have to tell me. It's written all over that pretty face of yours.. You came here to be an actress. I just hope you'll remember there's never been a great poem called "tits and ass."
They did not tell you how that porter cried out in the witness box when the Kings Counselor pressed him hard -- how he cried out that he was shielding a gentleman of consequence.
That porter was Gray and the gentleman of consequence who couldn't swallow the shame of it -- who took my last paltry savings to hire Gray --
Listen to me, Fettes, I'm one part befuddled with drink, one part over-heels in love with MacFarlane, and one part fey. You're a lowlander, Fettes, and you have no way of knowing what we Highlanders call the second sight.
Gray has no need to threaten. You remember the trial?
And did you hear them speak of the porter who testified against Burke?
Sidney, please, dear, if you feel nervous...
I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
You look way out there. Out past the date line. West becomes East, all things change. You cross the line...today becomes yesterday...or tomorrow, I forget which.
Luke, I need to switch next Friday for Thursday, so why don't you take the weekend... ...that way you'll be there, and I'll pick up Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
You tried that last week and we were on hold forty-five minutes...
It's Wednesday night. She's at my house. I'll talk to her.
But he had no idea, a lot of people had no idea. I only realised what was really going on when I got arrested.
I'm sorry but I have to leave. I'll find other work. You'll have to get someone else, that's all.
I have been questioned by the Gestapo just like that. Just like you questioned him.
I can't do this. It's not right.
Hi.
And it means something else too, doesn't it? I shall never, ever grow up.
I don't think so. The only trip I'll make in space is around the sun-- --on this satellite right here.
I envy you, Jerome.
Nothing yet. I'll start experiencing symptoms in my late-fifties. But unless they come up with something between now and then, I won't live much past 67.
It's here. My heart. I'm careful--weekly check-ups. I'm on a drug maintenance program, blood thinners, diet-- I just want you to know what you'd be getting yourself into.
Of course I think about it every day.
You wouldn t understand.
You did, huh? Good for you.
Well... goodnight.
Maybe not? You think that I'm with somebody else and now it's maybe not?
What about us? I'm moving away your staying here.
You don't mean that. You wouldn't disappoint Daddy --
Did Miss Harrington tell you to call Mr. Richards?
Sorry, but I like the way he looks and talks to me. And vice versa. Okay?
Drew, you're out of line.
Mm-mm. I never knew him. He died before Frank and I met. This here's... Frank and Tom's mother and father... there's little Frank and Tom...
She calls him Tommy...
Always did. I think she favored him a little. You tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.
Ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. They found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a Percheron stallion. She said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.
I got a little confused though. The ranch Ellen was talking about -- that's not this one?
Why do you always wear that hat?
He's badgering a witness. Eat.
You were scared, weren't you?
What do you think you're doing?
You know, I jus' can't remember when I felt so good before!
None! The State Department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. He's never investigated or charged by the Navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the CIA.
She thinks you should get married and have children of your own. Instead of trying to be a father to hers. Except she thinks you're afraid of the responsibility.
But he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the Russians. He meets Marina, whose uncle is a colonel in Soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's Russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.
I don't know if it's coincidence, but Oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the U2 program from his days at Atsugi Air Base in Japan. Six months after he arrives in Russia, Francis Gary Powers' U2 spy flight goes down in Russia. That plane was untouchable. Powers hinted that Oswald could've given the Russians enough data to hit it. As a direct result, the peace summit between Khrushchev and Eisenhower failed. I can't help thinking of that book Seven Days In May, maybe someone in our military didn't want the Peace Conference to happen, maybe Oswald was part of that. It gets weirder.
You want facts, Bill? Okay. From 1945 to '59 only two U.S. soldiers defect to Russia. From '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another Marine a month before Oswald. All of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.
Listen, if a boy wants to do homework with you, it really means he didn't have nerve to ask you out on a date, so you'll get your homework together and pretend to be studying, and the next thing you know you're ordering pizza and talking about your favorite movie stars.
I was gonna split it with you guys.
Hi, wanna help me pick out wallpaper for my new room tomorrow?
Excuse me?
Wow. So you made love. Ooo, I hear the birds chirping.
Oh come on. For her first time?
No, tell me.
Stop treating this like I'm going away with a man. He's just going to say those crappy, sick, complaining, angry things to me. I hate this, Mom -- I hate this. He's a freak show -- the worst person I ever met.
Will I see you again?
It's a crowded summer. We need every photo-opp, sound-byte and column inch we can get. Good night, Viktor.
Sometimes. But, just when I think your father's changing for the better, I realize he's as self absorbed as ever. He took the credit for Simone tonight.
I don't mind.
Well, I mean... I don't know you... This has never... I've never won anything and... I don't have a VCR.
Did Phyllis in accounting tell you to call me?
Kip - come and dance with me
What are you doing?
If you want.
I'm not coming.
But then why did you bother changing?
Let me get you a cup?
You don't own this place.
Don't yell at me!
I don't know.
I'm not sure where it is. Not exactly. I never saw it. I just heard him talk about it.
I don't know...
So, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?
I'm going to say I'm 104 sure.
I don't get why they'd do that.
And you can't?
At least they made an offer.
Going out as friends.
Don't go to the bar, Ray. I know him, that ain't a good idea.
Ed, you're gonna miss your own premiere.
Okay.
We're very lucky.
Yeah, he's going to think about it. You want me to pack for you?
Then you know where Jacqueline is?
Why?
You already did.
No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
I don't see what else you can do, Charles. If he's right - and the papers publish this story he has -
Night.
Ahh...
I know. We miss you too.
Oh.
When you're desperate for money, you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell. He's our man, I tell you.
Oh. Hi. I work in your office. I was on the junket to the conference. I'm --
Afraid of getting caught?
I did.
I can handle it. Besides, the money is good and some of the guys are cute. And you are in no position to be jealous.
Well, maybe I could just start a rumor, then.
I wish I could tell everybody that Ann's a lousy lay. Beautiful, popular, Ann Bishop Millaney.
Now that's all right, Barton. Everything'll be all right.
If I can. He gets jealous; he-
I'll try to slip out. If he quiets down, passes out... I'm afraid he thinks well, he said you were a buffoon, Barton. He becomes irrational
Hello, Barton.
Silly rabbit. My triumph isn't over her. It's over you.
That light is not daylight, I know it, I. It is some meteor that the sun exhales to light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet. Thou needest not be gone.
Then window, let day in and let life out. O, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
Anna? With this real-estate valuing stuff - - could you remind me, cause I'm a little confused about how exactly we do that.
Can I go to the hospital with you?
My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
If you get me pregnant with a boy he'll be a double direct heir and will end up killing you for the throne.
There is a seriously goofy man behind this. You are not allowed to block out that fact.
Johnny... what's going on? I don't get it... did I do something?
I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
Without you, my dearest, I might have died without ever knowing love. Inexpressible love! God of nature! Bitterness than which nothing is sweeter, sweetness than which nothing is more bitter. Divine monster which can only be defined by paradoxes.
Our abstinence makes our love immortal. If I loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now I should love you even more. But I should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.
My husband has convinced me of the contrary.
Shall I tell you something -- I believed what was called love came after the union -- and I was surprised when my husband, making me a woman, made me know it only by pain, unaccompanied by any pleasure. I saw that my imaginings had stood me in better stead. And so we became only friends, seldom sleeping together and arousing no curiosity in each other, yet on good terms for a while, as whenever he wanted me, I was at his service, but since the offering was not seasoned with love, he found it tasteless, and seldom demanded it.
How do you do. My name is Penelope Ryan. This is a simple-minded play about men who enjoy killing--and those who don't.
One more shot?
Again?
You're back! Hello. We were burgled.
... And the new stereo.
You called the police?
This girl has a child?
I thought you were married!
Tipico.
Any school you want.
Can we get out of here?
And get someone to help around the house.
Five million dollars?
A man, young lady! Lady, such a man As all the world- -why, he's a man of wax.
They came through the bushes, over the wall. What could I do?
Where are Thomas and Fedens?
I been getting a pain in my shoulder.
I tried already. The phones do not work.
I gotta pains in my shoulder too. I have a pain in my hip, and my right arm aches so much I can't sleep. It's a curse to be old. How you feel?
My creditors. One night, around three in the morning, they'll come into the casino -
Chauncey! Chauncey!
Oh, Chauncey, darling... Where have you been? We thought we'd lost you - we've been looking all over!
I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
...so I thought, what the hell, they make movies in L.A., not in Michigan, so I moved here.
Well, I left someone very special behind.
Well, it wasn't the simple, but yeah.
They'll run you out.
You too?
No, thanks. I'll take the bus.
Don't be too hard on him.
Well, he can just fuck himself.
Why did I have to do this to myself? Watch you take off. Call me if you need anything.
It's okay.
So you have an extra bathing suit, huh?
Kind of.
It's just that one of the few things I'm not confused about is what I was saying downstairs, that...
It's better when you let me say it.
But now's the time to end it, Louis. Now's the time to leave him.
I'll never get close to anybody.
I'm so relieved.
Is her mother still lying on the floor?
So it really has nothing to do with actual brain size?
So, uh...I threw it out, but I have this other one.
They want to be with you Luke, they go to your house to be with their father.
Please, Paul, why do we have to go to the roof?
He's being weird, I'm sorry. I have no idea why he's being weird and dressed in a suit --
What is it, Paul.
Raise away.
Yeah, it's good to get together.
'To bed'?
Where are you going?
The next one is ours. Either it hits us or it goes past us.
Don't be silly, Dawn.
Well, why do you always bring the carving knife in here?
I don't want to see you anymore.
So what are you doing going over there? You're not her doctor.
You're very rude... if you don't come back --
Ruth Lesserman had a pancreatic ulcer.
It turned out to be cancer.
Shush!
Aw, shut up. You had me at hello. 130.
"But you won't..."
We need to talk.
Wait. What about . . . him?
What are you talking about?
When I said Quincy could do better, I was thinking about you.
The doctor said it was okay. Anyway, I'm still trying to lose some of this baby fat.
You might want to put a jacket on him, it's getting cold.
He's fine.
Okay.
Where are you going?
She jumped out of the window.
Walter! D-did you see -- -- that?
I told her I wanted to come home. Daddy, don't be mad at me.
I have my family. Also our Lord Jesus Christ.
Promise you won't go inside.
You should have brought him.
Okay.
Caesar, I'm leaving.
Caesar, I'm serious. This is too much. I have to get out of here.
You hold great hope for this meeting.
These are good.
I saw her in the water. Beside me. She was filling the bathtub.
She finished my solitaire game and turned on the radio...she likes rock and roll. Angry rock and roll.
You're going to drive me crazy!
Yeah, but I'm not in jail and I tried.
Not really. If he finds it, I say Mr. Walker put the money in, and I didn't know nothing about it. Like the coke.
He won't -- I mean, he didn't the last time. He'll be expecting fifty thousand and there it is -- on top.
In the bag underneath.
Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
That's why you don't make a move till I come out of the fitting room.
I need this?
I just don't think you're being fair.
Pipe down, Lech. Let him order.
What's the matter?
The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
It mattered, Mom.
I'll love you, too, Charlie. I'll love you for twenty years.
Do you think anybody in the Fifties ever made love on a bed?
I'm trying.
I've never heard the Flintstones reduced to a sexual exploitation quite like that. You're funny.
Do you want to go out with me ?
That's all you cared about. I must have played in a thousand games and I can only remember you being to two.
That's ridiculous.
Go home, Cliff, wherever that might be.
This is Adam. Adam, meet Cliff.
You came back for these?
Your stuff? Let me see that.
Dead?
He's dead.
They don't know anything Peter, they just sense. They're hardwired!
I want you to take her with you.
I don't know.
Sure.
What happened?
Listen Meurice, you're gonna help me with a problem.
Is it cold in here?
Far fucking out! I've been wanting to meet one of the Blue Angels since I can remember.
Lynette, watch your mouth! Somebody might overhear.
I guess they musta sent 'im to another camp.
What's that you carryin'?
Aye. Then we'll leave her be.
Come on, Fergie. A rehearsal.
You know what. Go.
You were made for this.
I made macaroni.
You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
Is this a trick?
You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
Is that what you're calling it?
What is wrong with you?
That makes me feel just terrible.
Well, to make the figures come out even -- since I have no colds a year -- some poor slob must have five colds a year.
Say, you got a lulu.
Oh, I never catch colds.
You should have stayed in bed this morning.
Like, you know, giving blow jobs.
You weren't at my game.
What variables?
No there are variables that, like, I might not be good at.
Exactly. You're a household name now. You're moving in entirely different worlds. That's why I hope you're not toying with Viktor.
First of all, let me tell you something -- you don't know shit. Second of all, as far as we go, what time do you need? What have we been doing here, except time? Have I ever... ever pressured you!?
We can live in a hacienda.
I wanna get a job. I wanna work at Club Med.
We'll be drinkin' margaritas by the sea, Mamasita.
We can change our names.
Good.
Wide awake. I don't remember ever feelin' this awake. Everything looks different. You know what I mean. I know you know what I mean. Everything looks new. Do you feel like that? Like you've got something to look forward to?
You could call it that. My eyes are open.
Me too. I feel awake.
Yes! Yes! Now what kind of deal do you think that cop can come up with to beat that?
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
Jeffrey Wigand...
Oh, baby...
You said it in that tone! Like you were angry at me, my brother, at the world for forcing you to eat a nice lunch!
Why's that?
I simply can not stand that tone!
What makes you so high and mighty? Did you ever look at your own eyeballs in a mirror. You don't get eyes like that from...
Mom... what are you wearing?
Press thought "no," whaddaya think...?
Mary Magdelen?
Right...
Even Christ would partake socially.
Hand rolled.
Pipe!
Saint Peter?
Undoubtedly. Not the ascetics of course but, well Saint Thomas More...
Do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?
Saint Ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet. And of course
Long, thin and filtered.
None as far as I know.
Yes, but I...
Could there have been anyone else?
Obviously there was.
Yup. Not far from here, actually.
-- Yes.
I don't know that. Maybe Jon's already dead.
I took it from my fake husband.
No. But he needs treatment.
She answered our prayers.
What would be a good time for you?
All part of the business.
You planned this whole thing, didn't you?
We make our own choices, we pay our own prices.
Are you all right?
I've heard that, too.
I think I'll have the Seafood Salad Special.
Do you have Mrs. George for English?
Yeah. She is pretty good.
How would you know?
Nothing.
No, see -- that's exactly what those arrogant PG E fucks want me to think -- that because they got all this money and power, we don't stand a chance in hell against them. But you know what? They're wrong.
Did you?
It must be up in your old room. I will look.
Yes.
I came to you straight after he did it. I showed you what he'd done and asked for your help.
Leonard, you offered to help when you saw what this guy did to me.
I don't know what you're going to say, but I think that...
Brad, I'm - I'm not an old woman yet -
You. Us.
-- what are you talking about, come on --
Tell me why.
What? Tell me why you wanna know --
No she didn't; that's a lie.
Jaeger?
Ted, divorce is a terrible thing. I know, I went through it. You've got to believe I did everything I could to get Joanna to stay. But I'll tell you something. You may not want to hear it, but it took a lot of courage for Joanna to do what she just did.
Don't want to. I love you.
I don't care what you did for me. I don't think I want to know you anymore -- all you do is make me feel badly about myself. You have my number.
I'll take a bus.
...and if you want a thicker base, you can cut in a potato or just use a little flour.
Can I call the Mayor a bird of prey -- or is that libelous?
You should know they're tenacious when they want something. And Pinta wants to be friends.
He's no more an Indian than I am though. Anyhow, Doyle's gonna try and tease you and be mean to you to show off to his friends. Just like he does to Frank and me sometimes. You just ignore it. Or stay out here away from 'em if he'll let you. He's an okay guy till he gets drunk but tonight he'll get drunk. I guarantee it.
How are you getting along with Pinta?
Yes, she told me. Do you have children, Mr. Creasy?
Is the food alright? Maria tells me that you didn't eat.
It insults Maria. Slip it to the dog if you have to... Do you mind if I talk to you for a moment?
A tale more horrible than all the rest combined!
What you have to do is fight!
I don't think that's the thing to do! No! I think what you ought to do is-- fight !
Jeff--listen--remember the day you got here?--what you said about Mr. Lincoln?--that he was sitting up there--watching--waiting for someone to come along? Well--that was you . Someone with a little plain, decent, uncompromising rightness --to root out the Taylors--yeah, and really light up that dome for once. This country could use some of that--so could the whole drunken, cockeyed world right now--a lot of it! And when the right man comes along--no matter what the odds--he can't ever quit! A little fellow called David walked out with only a sling- shot--but he had the truth on his side--
I don't care what you've done! Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance like this to save a few pieces--other men could--but not you. As long as you lived, you'd remember you ran out and threw this country of yours to the jackals--!
We'll find one! Only throw compromise out of the window--stick to Jeff Smith, the man who first came to this town--get up and fight -- and we'll find some way. I don't know where we'll wind up--but the flag'll be flying--!
Where's some paper?
Maybe I should have - the first time he showed me what a mad dog he really was.
Yah - easy there - you do too! I'm expecting, ya know.
Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight.
Norman, you have to look at this!
Promise?
I just wish you could have heard her.
I know.
I'd never be able to live with mysel--
I just think pictures should say a little something.
So you take Plot 27-A, make it glossy, make it slick --
Please.
Some note Shawnee Easton told me to give to you.
A ride home.
Look, big head, I'll be at your car.
Did she waltz in or fly on little bat wings?
Oh, Peter, you're going to pursue this.
Now that you're on TV, you're a magnet for all the wackos out there.
Is anything wrong?
You never did answer my question.
Maybe we are and maybe we aren't.
But I want to say with you,
I'm not everyone else, Mr. Masry. I'm someone you made promises to that you didn't deliver on. I trusted you. With my kids' well-being. Now, I'm smart, and I'm hard- working, and I'll do anything. But if you think I'm leaving here without a job, you got another thing coming.
Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
Oh, hell. I'm dyslexic.
Don't take my picture!
I hate her. I really hate her.
Annabelle doesn't really want to talk to you right now.
I'm sorry I didn't mean to break your concentration. I thought it would be a nice moment to rememb...
Shut up, it's all right. Do you want a drink?
What are you babbling about, psycho?
Look!
Jake, you are never out of your head!
Pictures. Your wife was gonna toss 'em so "what's his name" brought 'em over on his way to school.
That's Sarah? I can see what you mean.
Gonna be visiting that all-woman's America's cup team in a few weeks -- If I were a gambler, I'd say Dennis O'Conner's days are numbered. But they're in San Diego, so I thought I'd take a quick promenade of the base.
You know.
No! No, I, eh, it's just that they sing.
No, I'm sorry. No, I didn't mean that. No, I didn't mean that.
Uh, you know, I think I can fake my way through a song.
C'mon, Rocky. I'm twelve.
Hmmm. Maybe I'll ask when I see you in person.
You're cold?
So. Not bored yet?
Why should I come hollering to you at all?
How did you know that?
Don't take cold, Jabez. Come -- it's warm in here.
Jabez --
My therapist said that --
Aren't you?
Why do you say I'm self-conscious?
What?
So you don't believe in therapy?
I don't see anyone for very long, Mr. Gittes. It's difficult for me. Now I think you know all you need to about me. I didn't want publicity. I didn't want to go into any of this, then or now. Is this all?
I mean I can't tell you.
I can't tell you.
There's a guard outside my door! I'm a prisoner, Nigel! Do you understand that?
Opportunity?
K... Cross.
Happy anniversary. You're a good match, you two. Can you help me with this stuff?
Thanks for coming.
Ulcers.
Something for burns.
In the guest room. I've laid out a paint table for them.
Hmm. Where are my kids?
Nevermind.
I hope they're watercolors!
A synthetic opium analogue.
Would you like to meet my husband?
Then set out the good plates, we'll all have lunch. My office will follow up with details. Jumping off, now...
I don't think so.
Are you really a bail bondsman?
Can I see your I.D.?
Who put up my bond? Ordell?
Can we stop for cigarettes?
I just told him if he ever gets to Mexico to look us up. I asked him not to tell. I didn't think he would tell anybody.
You told that thievin' little shit where we were goin'?!
Sure. Maybe over coffee sometime. I'll buy.
I... I...
How'd they find out we're going to Mexico, Thelma, how they know that?
What.
That J.D. kid is a little shit.
Oh, come on-I mean, I was still younger.
What... What are you talking about?
"... by the emperor of Rome. This writer asks: between a Senate that debates truth until they choke, an Emperor who has the birth sign of a woman, is it possible there is more virtue within the arena than without?"
"... encased in the armor of a demigod, Narcissus The Good continues his impossible climb in the arena where he was unjustly cast..."
I'll tell you what, you dedicate your first book to me, and we'll forget about the whole thing.
Great. I'm getting married. At least, I think I am.
Jack! It's Jani.
Sun City. I've been meaning to call you for months.
Thanks. He knows I love this, although why it couldn't have waited...
Ha. Did he say why?
Where's Dickie?
Is that what he said -- he wanted to be alone?
What does that mean?
I met a dashing young grad student after a recital one night...
Sounds quite beautiful.
Like what?
I wouldn't know. What kind of wife are you looking for?
What? What've I done?
Mother's not half so blind as you.
Why not?
So everyone I talk to says you're top drawer with silk stockings inside.
You'll hate me now, won't you?
Thank you, ma'am. Um, may I ask what this is regarding?
High-school pentathlete... ROTC scholarship, graduated with honors... top marks in Basic Training... and, as it just so happens, a constituent of my home state of Virginia. Oh, the things I'll do for one extra vote.
There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer...
They come through a few times each year. Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! It's a tour.
You're on your own today, honey.
I should be so lucky.
Yeah that's it.
It's not that world. It's your world. It's part of who you are.
Dad, you have to talk to Coach for me.
No -- just coffee, Gus.
Oh -- I'll take the same, I guess. And coffee.
I guess so.
I am thinking of publishing my "Highland Journals."
Craobhan-geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
I am told so.
I work for city hall.
I would like to finish reading this. What would I talk about? I haven't read this month's almanac. I don't care to hear about how the corn was this fall or how to get rid of gophers by putting garlic in their holes. They pride themselves in making life hard and that's not my cup of tea.
I am.
You have a real nice place... how can you afford this working as a temp ?
You know nothing about feelings, natural or unnatural.
I'll make it. I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. Voila!
You remember that from my book? I'm touched! What's wrong?
Oh! I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! You're like a boy sneaking in...
Where did you get those pants?
How's work?
Minor officials bother you, don't they?
Won't he be looking for you about now?
I guess you're just habitual.
What'd your father do?
Of course.
He wants your wisdom.
Father Barry.
You didn't answer my question.
So that's it? You don't ever want to see me again?
Good God...you don't think there really is a bomb shelter, do you?
Yeah, Ma, I love him awful.
Oh God, that's too bad.
What are you up to, eh, Savieer? I mean, not this but... Money, passports, a gun in a microwave? Who are you, eh? Who are you?
So what are we supposed to do?
What, it left a note?
Excuse me?
One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
...I see.
...Don't you?
No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
Why not?
I...I don't know...
You can't.
If you're interested in what people say, Signor Matisti, I may be able to enlighten you a bit. The newspapers, for instance. I'm an authority on what the papers will say, Signor Matisti, because I own eight of them between here and San Francisco... It's all right, dear. Signor Matisti is going to listen to reason. Aren't you, maestro?
No, I - Mike - wyncha sit over there, I'd prefer that.
But wishes don't come true.
I think I remember Linda, yah. She was - yah. So things didn't work out, huh?
I didn't forget.
No. It didn't.
If I eat it I'll throw up.
Weeping willow with your tears running down, Why do you always weep and frown, Is it because he left you one day, Is it because he could not stay, On your branches he would swing, Do you long for the happiness that they would bring, He found shelter in your shade, He thought his laughter would never fade, Weeping willow stop your tears, There is something to calm your fears, You think death as if you forever part, But I know he'll always be in your heart.
Maybe. But that's not the real reason. You think if I tell, he'll disappear and that's what you want! Me all to yourself!
Any time.
No last names, Jonah. Hello there, you sound younger than our usual callers. How come you're up so late?
You don't like the one he was now?
Got me there. What's your Christmas wish, Jonah?
Where's your mom?
I'm not lying, I... I can't remember... leave me alone!
Yes, but...
No, I... I held it up to...
Yes, maybe... I don't remember...
I'm touched.
We had a seance.
What?!
You're upset because you want to go to Fiji. Is that it?
Goodnight then.
This I gotta see.
Try holding the match like this.
No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
Oh, are you all right?
He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
I don't.
There's nothing wrong with being a butcher.
...7548. Have you... Have you found him yet?
Oh, Rocky -- you worked so hard.
Mr Lombard?
Just a moment... Go ahead.
Smells like piss. Is this real, Candy? Is this really real? I mean we are in an insane asylum, an' I wanna know how we got ourselves into this scene.
Who is he?
Okay, Jeremy...go get Dr. Chris Raymond, will you?
Did you hear me? Get Dr. Raymond! NOW!!
...and, and, and did she...? And she did the seven shows...
Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
Yeah, like that.
Oh God, how horrid.
Hold that thought.
You shouldn't. You shouldn't trust anyone... certainly not the Attorney General who wants it all for himself. Not the young federal agent who wants your job. Not even the old man who just wants to hang onto what he's created. Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.
This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
The safest place of all.
What is he doing in here?
You're going to find yourself on the floor.
Why?
I guess I just don't understand anything.
I was talking to Dad.
I didn't want to stop.
You all act like two roosters.
Why don't you talk to him now?
Not even if they're a dork. You should go by and see how he's feeling.
Michael, you shouldn't be happy when someone else isn't feeling well.
Frank -- I know you're busy, but Michael asked me after dinner if you were angry with him. He wanted to know why you weren't talking to him.
Don't use language like that at the dinner table.
Are you Jorge?
Yes?
Yes?
That's no secret. I'm five.
Mummy!
I'm sorry.
Can we call you "Weird Al"?
Seriously. What's it like to be eighteen?
Alright, let's boot up.
Ready?
Go fix the phones.
What is it? What's wrong?
Realize?
I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
He's very... clean.
I guess. Except I'm one of the people it frightens.
Why?
Richard was in the army. I met him while I was living in Naples. I didn't know where Iowa was. I only cared that it was America. And of course, being with Richard.
So, what is it you do, Mister...?
You loser!
No. You know they say, that it never rains, that you can barbecue on Christmas day...instead of riding your bike, you just surf over to your friends house. Oh, and the place is just crawling with celebrities. I know someone who saw Walter Matthau picking up his dry-cleaning.
I might actually get the pasta special.
Yeah. Thanks.
What?
Alex.
As smart as you are, you'll need a little help.
What happens when you lose?
Oh, gosh.
No--
In Terry Canyon?
And a beautiful woman, too--don't you think?
Don't touch it. And for Godsakes, try not to sweat. They can sense chemical changes...
That's it. That's it. Breathe easy.
It is accepted, Mr. Carter, with assurances of my deepest regard.
April?
Yes, I guess. Yes.
Let's stay here, Will.
No. Why?
Come on, Will.
What happens to Dunbar now?
It's already planned, Mike. It's going to cost 150 at the Free Clinic.
We've got to get an abortion?
Forgive me, but it was superstition ...foolish, childish wishes...that started, all this.
I can see it all...the very day it began. Amy was lonely; she was desperate for friendship. I remember the night she told me she had wished on her ring. That must have been the day she first wished for a friend.
Half. Okay? Seventy-five dollars. And a ride to the clinic.
You have a weakness for Lady Cops.
I don't know...
I think it's probably still a good idea.
I'll miss you, Mike.
Now who the hell is going to do that for me?
I've loved you for a very long time. I'm sorry! I shouldn't have said that.
So make an exception.
Really? I thought it was appropriate maybe. That's all. I really admire the work that you do. I know it's not proper to be so familiar but I guess since we're outside the workplace I feel a certain liberty to --
Okay. Good. Great. Thanks. I like you, Howard... an awful lot. Is that terrible?
You are such a sweetheart.
I won't forget.
I don't know, Jabez.
You aren't angry with me?
...What?
Look, I'm me, right. You're not. We are what we are, like it or not. Why all the bloody needle?
There's practically a whole book about how that statistic is not true --
It's not true, but it feels true.
Yeah.
What was that about up there?
It doesn't have anything to do with being smart.
Are you on the other line?
Hi, Mike?
Mmm...
Teh... Tehronne?
Well, what's the difference? I just need it.
You're a sweet man, Richard.
Yeah.
Mm-hm.
And Joe's huge in Europe. He's like a rock star in London. His novels sell millions.
Oh, no, sir.
Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again!
Well, you're a tower of support.
We've only been over this how many times?
We couldn't be on more solid ground.
Don't you ever see him?
It's an alt-azimuth design with one parabolic mirror and one secondary flat one.
Jordan. I don't expect you to fully understand this -- but sometimes there's more to be gained from the fight than the victory.
Because you've changed so much.
I love the way she writes.
Me? Oh, uh. No.
Well, I don't know. I mean, I guess- I guess you must be sorta late, huh?
When did you get back?
But why would a man need more than one woman?
She cares for you and she needs your help, Chauncey... there's much to be looked after...
Food. My mama, she doesn't feel well. I couldn't stay away from her too long, cause of her condition but I could do chores in the mornings.
No... No. It is just the English way.
I can't do anything but I would learn it for you if you have a little extra.
I know about you.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything.
I want to work, Miss Lady.
Eventually. We were going to be engaged... when you came back from overseas...
Honey, you all right?
I cannot believe this. It's four- thirty, Jim Garrison. I have five children are gonna be awake in another hour and ...
Pretty. She's a blond.
I don't want to leave the convent, Mother.
These books are getting to your mind, Mr. Garrison. I wish you'd stop readin' them.
Exactly.
Again? Johnny Cammareri.
No.
You're not gonna marry him, Cosmo. Do you love him, Loretta?
Yes, thank you. Intravenous if possible.
Bullshit.
I'm very tired, George.
To mothers. And all that we owe them...
Blanca...a rubio like you. I see her in a dress...an old photograph from Lucinda somebody's wedding...everybody is with couples. Husbands and wives. They all pose. My mother is alone because my father had to go back to the fighting. ...she looks right into the camera. She is the most beautiful woman in the room. By herself. In a party dress. And she looked like she knew she would die alone... She spoke many languages. We were in Luanda when she died. I went to her friends in Mali. They sent me to the Ecole Polytechnique in Geneva to study mathematics, where I met Montoya in the discos. He had banking there...I was seventeen and very much into the clubs. And he sent me to University for an MBA in Finance. Your mother?
It's too... elegant. The degree of economy is extraordinary; it's really the next logical step... Even on Earth technology has always aspired to a condition of nature. D.N.A. outclasses any computer we can come up with; the human body is the most exquisitely designed machine imaginable.
I was referring to the selectees mingling with the selectors.
So. Is this kosher fraternizing with the enemy like this?
I don't think so.
Not exactly. It has organic qualities, but we don't really understand how they're integrated with the mechanical systems.
You don't have to do that.
What?
I called a fellow I know in Tulsa, the one who plays my chauffeur. There's a sucker there he says is made for us. And a boroker that just shut down, we can use their office, not change a thing! Now, I can scrape up ten grand without much trouble. That leaves fifteen or twenty for your end. We could start this weekend, get the sucker into position --
But the setup's there. It's there now.
It means you don't talk to anybody. You don't draw attention to yourself in any way. Do you understand that?
Nya-nya-nya!
What are you up to?
I should go to the house, get breakfast.
No. No. I can't. If Ram n ever found me on a picket line ...
Good...Another is you're trying to make it all about sex and heat and nothing else.
Did you... kill him?
It should be... It's yours. I want our debt forgiven. I want to be the exclusive distributor of Obregon Brothers Cocaine for the United States. And I want the principle witness against my husband, Eduardo Ruiz, killed.
That's crazy. My husband is on trial for smuggling.
Part of... with them?
Nick, what are you talking about?
I forgot all about Aaron. I promised to stop by and see how he did.
That's all right. We have no secrets from our readers. Mr. Thatcher is one of our most devoted readers, Mr. Bernstein. He knows what's wrong with every issue since I've taken charge. What's the cable?
Can you prove it isn't?
Mr. Bernstein, Mr. Thatcher -
I think we'll have to send our friend Wheeler a cable, Mr. Bernstein. Of course, we'll have to make it shorter than his, because he's working on an expense account and we're not. Let me see - Mike!
Oh, come on, where's your sense of adventure? We're going someplace you never been before.
Some kind of half-wit, no-good, big-haired, bimbo, I bet.
No. I'll see you at your apartment as soon as I can.
What? When did it happen? Your dad and I always expected you two to get married.
You know Mom, it's okay to have male friends. Besides, it's over with me and Charlie.
Mom, how about a machine that's like your blender, only it slices vegetables, kneads dough, chops meat and even make fresh pasta?
You know, dear, I think the pantyhose is a wonderful idea, but the next time you come up with something, please don't stay out all night. Just tell us. We'll believe you.
Oh, go feel up your hamsters! I hear rodents put out.
What does Charlie think about that?
Do you like pigeons?
Very slick.
With a little more patience and kindness. That's what makes people mean and difficult. Nobody cares enough about them.
What's that?
What?
Yes, she was afraid. She said there was someone who wanted to kill me.
I'll go, but I want my money right now!
I wonder why.
You ought to be afraid, the way you fuckin' treat me!
That was a pity...
I thought so, too.
Ann Bishop Millaney.
Oh. What... Yeah. Okay.
Don't be mean, this is hard for me too.
I don't know.
How could I expect you to tell me something that I wouldn't even tell myself?
I'm a terrible friend.
No.
I got there first. Stan covered up the pills and I had it out with Norman. He seemed desperate not to lose you. He promised to handle it. And we all let it drop away.
All of us.
No Doyle. Vaughan don't want to come to a party with you.
OK, I'm fine.
I have not touched your sh-- Stuff. You watching this?
Sorry, Daniel, I'm a physicist, not a psychiatrist.
Daniel, what are you doing here?
So what do you want to see?
Karl, now listen, there's gonna be a party tonight here at the house. Doyle's invited his music-playin' buddies over to make a bunch of racket out on the patio.
Indeed.
One guess.
I'll go.
I don't know.
HELP! HELP!!
Pleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson.
Strange to be calling yourself.
Maybe it's not me.
Leon hung himself...
You're so naive Bud, you don't even know. Your dad took care of you. I might've been rich when I was a kid...but my father lost all his money...in the seventies, in the stock market, at the track. He was a lousy gambler...
Unicorn -- a kind of animal --
There's plenty of use for reading -- you'll see.
Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
Earthquakes?
When would Agnes have conceived the child?
Oh, some time in January.
Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
Yes.
Visitors to the convent.
Nothing.
Take at look at it.
There's nothing here.
...This is what I don't like, you see: you don't refrain me, but at the same time I can't get out!
Well, I guess we're not a very proper family.
What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about... Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
What's the matter with him?
Listen, you are witnessing genius!
Not usually this drunk.
In a moment he's going to tell he could have been someone --
-- instead of what he is --
You real down?
Enid! I'm so sorry about what happened.
What do you mean?
What?
It's nothing -- it's just some hormonal thing... don't worry about it...
The whole business with the art show and the newspaper -- it's absolutely --
Huh?
It's so, Mr. Hillyer.
It's very wicked to spy. Why did you do it?
I didn't see it.
Have you found a place to stay?
I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big.
My husband is a proud man, sir. He would be furious if he knew I'd come.
No, sir. This is my own idea.
Sir, we really need this job. We're desperate. My husband spends far more than he can ever earn. I don't mean he's lazy - he's not at all - he works all day long. It's just! he's not practical. Money simply slips through his fingers, it's really ridiculous, Your Excellency. I know you help musicians. You're famous for it. Give him just this one post. We'd be forever indebted!
Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
I think the last one was defective. The plus sign looked more like a division sign.
Honey!
But it is what I want.
Yes. What do you mean? What's wrong?
Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
Twelve years younger.
Oh, I shouldn't have...
It's a chemical they used over at that compressor station up the road there.
That must have been awful for you.
We sure like havin' you.
All right then. Well, I'll see you later. If you see Frank, tell him to come on back home. I don't get to see him all day except Sundays. He can play tomorrow.
Ok, I will... later.
But I like to... and I don't smoke that much.
I'm not. It's just corny, but I'm not into it.
Oh... that's nothing, someone gave it to me.
I spent three years with him. I just couldn't take it not knowing who was gonna pay the rent... his unemployment or mine. George was adorable but it drove me crackers. Now at least I'm comfortable. Lester does what he says he'll do. Maybe you're happy living like a gypsy. Are you?
I'm so glad to have met you at last. You're just as nice as Amy told me you were. I hope you'll come to see us.
Mmm, I love Cristal, let's have some.
Egypt?
I don't know, though, I feel so guilty because Alvy is paying for it, so, you know, so I do feel guilty if I don't go to bed with him. But if I do go to bed with him, it's like I'm going against my own feelings. I don't know I-I can't win.
Don't get angry at me. Maybe you just need a day job.
All I know is, ever since "Glen Or Glenda," all you do is booze it up and wear my clothes!
Not you, Donna, not you.
Let me show you...
Think about it! They followed you every step of the way. There was always a safety net. The taxi, there was a diver. At my house, the window was rigged... they shot at us with blanks...
Why?
Why?
I haven't got the job yet.
He went over to the hospital to call on Professor Egelhoffer.
I know, dear. I understand. But try to worry a little less about her -- be a little easier in your thinking. And especially today let's forget about it. We want a really bang-up birthday party, don't we?
I don't want to leave you.
I've never seen your place.
Why do we always stay here?
And the funny thing is. Mr. Malkovich, my voice is probably the least intriguing thing about me.
Whatever you're having.
I've never been looked at like this by a woman.
Oh, you know, not a lot. Just hanging around his apartment. I think he must be a lonely man.
All aver the world. They say he's spent half of his life overseas.
Rich. Reclusive. Bankrolls half a dozen charities.
It's Charlie!
It's her! I'm telling you. She whispered and turned on the music. She's trying to contact me!
What are you going to do with it?
Ummm ... in the linen closet.
Ah, you fuck! You're such a fuckin' asshole!
Benjamin -- do they know you?
Ben -- what's happening? Who is Mr. Gladstone?
There's nothing you can do here, they'll die or they won't, we just --
What?
It was the nicest thin I've done in a long time.
Do me? Do me like this, you mean? Like chainin' me up?
He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
I don't think you're very polite.
We both lied to him.
Let's leave the man in peace so he can get ready.
Just don't lie to me.
He wanted to ride back down with you. Now sit and relax, get some- thing in that flat tummy of yours --
Yeah. Uh, well, sure we did. An- an-and in a way you led me on, because I truly believed you were unhappy with Hannah. Otherwise, I would never have let myself be drawn in. I was very weak. So were you. Now I've met someone else.
I paid for it and everything.
I've got to be honest with you. I met someone else. I've met someone else. I...I told you I wasn't going to wait forever.
Come on, darling -- we're going up to bed.
I'd know it, Eddie. I'd know. For God's sakes, what are you trying to do to me? I love you.
He gave these to you?
No. I made you up, didn't I, Eddie? You weren't real. I made you up, like everything else. There was no car crash, Eddie. When I was five, I had polio. I was never an actress. The rich old man is my father. He walked out on us when I was seven. He sends me a check every month. That's how he buys his way out of my life. The men I've known... after they left, I'd say they weren't real, I made them up. But you, Eddie. I wanted you to be real.
Packard. Sarah Packard.
Bobby and I have had enough excitement for tonight.
Oh, I do want to know. I tried to reach you at the precinct.
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.
Want a bite?
You don't need to lose any weight. You're kidding, right? You look great. Very fit.
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner. I don't want to ruin your willpower.
No.
How about over here?
That little prick.
That little prick.
Remember when I went to Italy and canceled the policy on the new stadium. Well, we weren't being cheated by the Mafia or anybody except maybe by me... ... Do they come for lunch everyday? I really went on my own business, to see a man that I happen to be in love with... and I'm glad I did it, but I'm sorry about the policy and I'll be happy to make up the money the company didn't get... of course just now I don't have... One million, four hundred and ten thousand dollars. But if you were to dock my salary, say, twenty dollars a week, in a few hundred years we'd be even... and I think this is where you fire me?
Will that interfere with my getting maternity leave? I'm pregnant.
Yes. I tried to talk to Ted-- my ex-husband--about it, but he wouldn't listen. He refuses to discuss it in any serious way. I remember one time he said I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a baby- sitter for Billy.
Yes, isn't it wonderful? I'm so happy. I'll bet I'm the happiest pregnant fired person in the world!
No.
There's a lot of people here.
I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
Yes, you are, When I was straightening up the couch, you know what I found? Six hairpins, a lipstick, a pair of false eyelashes, and a swizzle stick from the Stork Club.
You mean to someone like Mr. Sheldrake.
The first couple, yes, but after that it became increasingly difficult.
I'd like to, but...
You'll learn.
What do you think?
Very early. Dawn.
Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
Crane.
I'm sorry.
You okay?
About you and Jill and needing a third person. She went back to Lillian?
I'm sorry about what I said.
... Come in, Chauncey - please come in...
Good night.
I don't know.
What girl?
You've been watching the film.
Shouldn't think so.
You don't even know me.
And how long have you been a dentist?
It's her baby too, you know.
That's my son Thomas's baby.
I wake up this morning, I hear the baby crying. So I wake up. I come in their room. That girl is shaking her hand atta baby. I said, "You brute! Don't you strike that baby! That's my son's baby!"
Sure, sure.
Hey, why don't you go to the movie? Your mother and me, we're gonna be baby-sitter.
You know the old man upstairs in this house. Old Irishman, always drunk. He got pleurisy. He was inna hospital two weeks. He died yesterday.
Well, I always like to visit you, Catherine, because you always got such cheerful news.
I came for my clothes.
I rang. It seemed like the proper door for a servile, worthless organism to use.
I came for Paul as well.
You took him to the funeral, I hear.
A dozen?
And you never defend me. You're afraid of her.
You're a mama's boy, if you want the truth.
Oh shit.
It means it's too cold to go swimming. And I don't mean the water.
One that will approach this matter with some objectivity and respect.
One that will ask the questions you want asked.
If we want to hire a psychiatrist for Agnes. we'll find our own, thank you.
You're what?
Unless what?
Of course it matters! It's Mario!
I'm getting married tomorrow.
Hi.
Oh, c'mon. For Christsake, do I have to tell you everything?
No. I work for National Paper. It's a good job. I make eight-twenty-three an hour. When I get enough money saved, I plan to go on to college.
I am answering...
Why?
Well I wouldn't run home and tell him whenever I went to bed with someone, if that's what you mean.
Is there anything else you want to know?
John Book, I would appreciate it if, during the time you are with us, you would have as little to do with Samuel as possible.
Look, I didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, I just thought you'd call when you came back. You didn't and... Don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.
Brian, do you always have to be so stupid? Think about your future for once.
He was a chemical engineer with a food company.
The other man, the dead man, his wife is a doctor - Dr. Helen Remington. She's here, somewhere. As a patient, of course. Maybe you'll find her in the hallways tomorrow on your walk.
Well, yes. You're getting out of bed tomorrow. They want you to walk.
Yes. From Wendel. To celebrate, the license approval for our air-charter firm. I forgot to tell you.
John, you have to throw the keys up to me.
Goodnight, Mr. Ansel.
Open your eyes, she's eleven years old! Her only friend in the world is dead.
It's . . . it's locked.
Bye, Mom.
Thanks.
No.
Because he called me.
...but you did it for greed, Sidney - and that's pathetic.
Would you get that, dear?
Joe... Joe...
What would you like it to be to me...? I, I, I can't invest in failure.
Yes. We've all got to let go.
You're pressuring yourself...
I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and... my first yuppie.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I'm late.
Surgery. The elevator disaster downtown on the news last night. Cable snapped, a car dropped ten floors. Non-union contractors. Monsters. We're starting with an amputation.
Put some butter on it--or ice?
Fill for a second.
Paper.
Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the houseplant.
You had enough?
I'm not sure.
I have a class. I'm late.
That's really cool.
Is that your camper?
She's shy.
I don't have a date. I don't want a date.
...until the plan changed, when Jessie's mom gave us these tickets. What, Rachel. 'forgot' I told her?
At the Big Apple Circus, it's the only big top I know. I said I'd get 'em back tonight...
Just outside the big top, we're almo...
I know -- why should a bitter divorce interfere with tradition?
Disappointed.
Rogan, Laurel. You also have a Rogan, Lillian. She won't need it. Sell it.
When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach. Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. Not with that look.
Yeh?
Think twice. Before you ever pull that again.
Actually. They'll want Annabelle's mother.
Which is what?
Yeah.
Knock yourself out.
Yeah, I know what you're saying.
Yeah, I was all wet about your idea man... Well, thanks for being so generous... It is human, and you are divine... No, he's no faker. He's the 100 real McCoy beware-of- imitations genuine article: the guy is a real moron --
I'm just too adorable. I'm just too adorable.
You know, I think you're right. I'm just too adorable.
Laura Palmer, you're just too adorable.
I don't know what to do.
You know what your problem is? You're just too adorable...
No, and yes. I don't know what I'm going to do about Bobby. I know he is seeing someone else and that's okay with me, and he thinks I'm seeing someone else and that's not okay with him.
Are you going to tell him about that "someone else"?
He probably wanted to drive over.
Were you with Bobby? Or are you two still fighting?
What! How do you know?
Here's such a coil! Come, what says Romeo?
Yeah?
What if you can't make yourself happy? What if everything falls apart?
Your a real philosopher.
You don't know?
So what's it like?
Do they have those ... Where you come from?
I'm busy.
Out there.
I won't be selling you this house, Mr. Bloom.
I was 18. He was 28. Turns out that was a big difference.
Why did you call me? The last person I ever expected to get a call from was you.
Then I don't think so Mr. Bloom. If nothing is going to change, I'd just as soon it not change in the way it hasn't been changing all this time.
I'm not convinced you should be happy.
No.
It never came up.
You seemed determined to do that anyway.. Why didn't you tell me you were a famous MiG insulter? MAVERICK Would it have made a difference?
Dr. Homer Wells.
I don't like myself very much anyway.
Why not?
I'm going to write a letter to Mrs. Sheldrake.
Jabez -- once you said we'd never change --
But Jabez -- the washing has to be done --
Do I have to?
... So am I.
I want my fucking money --
It's my paycheck. Which I earned. Which I deserve. Which I shouldn't have to beg for. That fat-ass bitch won't give it to me.
Fuck you. Make time. Cause I bust my ass for you. I watch everything else in my life go straight in the toilet, for you. And what do you do for me? Huh? You see the way I'm treated around here -- but have you ever stood up for me once? Have you ever mentioned to everyone what good work I'm doing? Have you ever bothered saying, hey, Erin doesn't get paid the most cause she has the best tits; she gets paid the most cause she's the best God damn employee I've ever had?
Oh. I guess you got the whole story.
The day you got me out of jail?
Why?
When did you decide?
Wait a minute. After we were together you went and snuck into a guy's house?
I don't want to see any more beef jerky. I mean the next beef jerky you hand me is going out the window. It's drivin' me crazy. The whole car smells like it.
Just asking.
Well, I figure if you take a state policeman, shoot up his car, take his gun and lock him in the trunk, it's best to just get on out of the state if you can.
Yes.
Louise... are we still going to Mexico?
Don't ever stop fucking me!
I don't care what the damn pioneers ate. You just keep that shit away from me, now I mean it.
It's good. It's what the pioneers ate.
Did they deserve it today?
There's blood on your shirt. Is that an integral part of your job?
Do you enjoy it?
I remember you from Christmas Eve. You have a thing for helping women, don't you, Officer White?
You say 'fuck' a lot.
... and when I realized our area's just as bad as Hinkley, I thought maybe my neighbors are all sick too. So I went and asked.
Uh-huh. Spent the last few days knocking on doors. And you know what? They're not. I mean, they got problems, but none of this cancer stuff. And their pets are fine. So I don't know -- I just can't shake the feeling that it wasn't no multivitamin they put in the water.
Interesting.
Rub it on the windows!
I'll see you tomorrow.
What's wrong with you?
Well, well. Ho, ho, ho. You moonlighting at Macy's, Frank?
You and Harold are friends?
When you don't they're usually nice.
Except when he doesn't say things they're usually nasty.
Huh? Oh, yeah, I guess. Mm-hmm.
What's it say?
I'll come by your place, right after...drink, take pills... Love you.
Did you hear what I just said -- do you have that? Take a breath.
Of course -- I went to the Muncie, uh, Secretarial Polytechnic!
No.
There's one called....Window... something with a window.
You're acting like a crazy person.
She's unbelievable. Who needs satellites when we've got Dolores's mouth?
Doesn't it have a name?
Otis!
You mean that girl, don't you?
I thought you said you weren't going anywhere.
Told you I was nice. I'm going to be the first girl in the NBA.
She needs to stop running around like a little boy.
Why not?
In Europe women find older men very sexy.
He do that every year?
Way to hoop.
I hear she does more than talk with her mouth.
Basquiat, don't lie. This is smack.
You can be in a room with 100 men, and not like any of them, or you can be in a room with just one man, and he's exactly the one you want.
Kinda like men.
Just what you underlined.
Over this?
You are one scary son-of-a-gun.
I know a short-cut.
I can't help it. Perry Como always does this to me! I just get so cranked!
Yeah, same here. Don't forget your suitcase.
Ummm. It's good.
Should I come with?
Yeah? What?
You're kidding...? Carol, you have beautiful hair.
Call you back. You bastard! What do you want?
Isn't Zerzura supposed to be protected by spirits who take on the shape of sandstorms?
Maybe I like to find out about a man first. Maybe I like to know what he's made of.
Did he say anything about my sister?
How sweet. Standing by your man, even after what he did. You're a very understanding person.
Oh?
I thought it was important for you to know the facts.
He been sleeping in a T-shirt lately? That's so you won't see the fingernail marks on his back. Bet you didn't know your boyfriend finds a little pain exciting. He didn't either...at first.
With me, where he's been after work, three, sometimes four nights a week for the last two months... We have what you might call an intimate relationship.
Don't matter. Just got to go--an' keep a-goin', till we get plenty a distance away from here.
Where is everybody?
Yah, thanks a bunch. So what's the deal, now? Gary says triple homicide?
Prowler needs a jump.
Hiya, Lou.
Hon?
I know everybody says it, but I really mean it.
Hi, Mark.
You hate gambling.
You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
I'm doing some volunteer work.
Hi.
Need any help?
This is all very pleasant but why are here?
I can't wait any longer. Tell me, do you think one of them did it?
I wish you'd tell me who.
That's nothing. I saw him myself.
And I'm afraid. Oh god, I'm so afraid of...
What? What are you afraid of?
Tell me. Please.
That I'll just...that one day I'll just...disappear.
Can I have that pad and the pencil?
Tell me. I can help you.
You can fix old cars. Mr. Washburn told me that the cars they're making now are all computerized--
"Mad about the boy."
That's our reserve air.
Why?
I don't care.
No. You know too many sick ladies.
...just for a second. So, now I got that out of my system and I can go back to the thing that makes me happiest.
And I know too many people. Obviously, we're both lonely. Would you like to know where I was going tonight - when you ran into me and ruined my Sunday clothes?
I could spend some time with you tomorrow morning, before Carl comes back, I mean, if you'd like to.
As a matter of fact, he's the one who introduced me to Carl... How are you?
Robert?
Yes.
Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts!
You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat.
Lucky girl.
I know.
Oh -- Jabez.
Michael...
Michael?
Would you like me better if I were Ingrid Bergman?
Would you like me better if I were a nun?
He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him?
Oh, God!
Quincy, I told you about these fat-ass girls.
I'm not playing with you, these girls are looking to get you caught. They see you, they see dollar signs.
Do you think I did it?
Are you going to represent me?
What would do that...?
It won't hold, Ronnie, it won't prove out.
You must have some feeling. Some immediate impression. A young, attractive woman, involved with an older man who leaves her everything in his will. And the things that went on in that house. Such wild sex. What kind of picture does that paint?
You're not going to blame this on Castro, are you?
I suppose Castro staged the whole thing just to beat you.
I have to go home. Chet might call.
-- When you say forty-five minutes or an hour, do you mean continuous time? Just continually, without stopping?
Funny is funny and scary is scary. You don't mix them.
Right. And when the worm's ready, it zips out with the money and erases its tracks.
I lie to my parents every day. And every night.
Oh, that monster. How could you be working with him?
These old movies are such a hoot. They thought they were being scary, but they're just funny.
Let's just wait and see what happens.
What other issue is there, Sid?
You can't work in an apartment where you owe three months' rent.
Shelly's already told me all about sex.
I'll be all right. Peter, at the very end, I think Father was back. I saw it in his eyes.
He's been repeating that since Birdson's exorcism. I looked in every passage in the Bible and there's nothing about an ark or a sunset that tells us anything.
I'll bring the children up now; they want to say goodbye.
Goodbye, Michael.
You would have killed his brother?
Nah, don't say anything. I'm alright.
Michael.
Can I go in?
But Rimgale's probably going to come around to arson.
-- The argument had nothing to do with it.
That's not true.
You're having a nervous breakdown, that's what's happening.
That's right, but I don't understand-
He's a director.
-- what guy?
Oh, honey. If we had one place, we could have a nicer place and I could take care of it. We're almost never here.
I placed...?
Be nice, sweetie. We're just here to help you.
Yes. Yes, it does.
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to-
Don't get up. And please stop acting as if I were the queen mother.
Can I ask you a question?
Yeah?
Oh, my babies.
Never mind.
That's just why I'm going.
No.
I trust you.
You might do that. Get me a ticket for... No, you don't!
He wants us to follow. The little boy...
You just have to control it. We're not apes.
It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of.
Cheese. It's a kid's place.
Did she ever see Vada?
What happened to her?
I don't know, tonight you just seemed a little cool, not opening car doors and...
Are you mad at me?
You can look in the bathroom if you want. People are always curious about that, like what happens when you flush.
For how long?
Yes I know, it runs in the family. New book?
The last time was a Chuck E. Cheese party a year ago. He hid in one of those purple plastic tunnels and didn't come out.
They're enormous, I know.
Oh yeah?
And what about the other fella?
They seduce you?
Actually, I don't...
I work at an insurance place and at Penny's, so Cole can go to that good school.
I'm somewhere, thinking of you. And meatballs. And you know what?
Prettier than Ann?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Hide me somewhere deeper? Somewhere buried?
Look at you, cutey! What are we doing?
The big part of you has no words and it's-a wolf. This woman was a trap for you. She caught you and you could not get away. So you chewed off your foot! That was the price you had to pay to be free. Johnny had nothing to do with it. You did what you had to do, between you and you, and I know I'm right, I don't care what you say. And now you're afraid because you found out the big part of you is a wolf that has the courage to bite off its own hand to save itself from the trap of the wrong love. That's why there has been no woman since that wrong woman. You are scared to death what the wolf will do if you make that mistake again!
Fuck you.
Because he'll kill me.
I was raised that a girl gets married young. I didn't get married until I was twenty-eight. I met a man. I loved him. I married him. He wanted to have a baby right away. I said no. Then he got hit by a bus. No man. No baby. No nothing! I did not know that man was a gift I could not keep. I didn't know... You tell me a story and you think you know what it means, but I see what the true story is, and you can't. She didn't leave you! You can't see what you are. I can see everything. You are a wolf!
You don't understand.
I can't leave.
Did you like making love to me?
My father was an alcoholic who drank himself right into the grave.
Why? They don't hold him for more than a day or two.
Vaughan's "friend" will be there, too. He works at the funeral home. And Frank. You know Frank likes you a lot. He says you make him feel calm.
Where are you going?
Did you call about the Feurs?
Norman, you are so funny about that. No, I didn't.
Which is guy-speak for...
Where are we now, Commodus? Can you see the camp? My Gods! The air is turning into ice!
What's the problem?
You get it straightened out?
Harry? That's bullshit. We stood right there --
No. If anything, after I looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. It had character, you know?
What's Harry doing with your suit in there?
I thought I did.
Not really. I didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, I thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.
You ride with Annabelle...
Very much live.
Because I didn't have it. Ray, I swear, Melanie came in and grabbed it. And someone killed her for it.
-- And you haven't moved out yet. It's because you're too lazy, Ben. Too scared or lazy to either deal with us or simply make a decision --
Jimmy, my daddy's still alive and it kind of gives me the creeps when you do that...
She's off with Jimmy, that's her boyfriend.
I finally found my story.
Maybe.
So why do you want to go?
That was the first time you attempted to commit suicide, wasn't it? You must try to talk about it, Billy.
What was it about her that disturbed you so, Billy?
You really believe that?
Was it your idea to visit her on Sunday?
Tell us about it...
Okay.
Well, what is it, honey?
Okay.
Oh, I don-- Ask Elliot for that. Uh, he's got them somewhere.
Where are the antihistamines?
Get a garter belt... Get a garter belt and flirt.
I should get a garter belt.
Maybe when she's eighty, she'll stop straightening her garter belt when there's a guy around.
God.
Yeah, she knows it, too, 'cause she's flirting with all the men here.
She really does, though.
You're the hip and fresh.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean, I just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.
I -- I -- I...
You think so?
That's it?
Why am I being lectured in this way?!
I'm not so sure of anything as you are, John Book. You could live this life if you wanted to bad enough. Just as I could live yours!
Yes.
There was a time when I would have welcomed it.
There was a time when I thought you might have stayed.
You're so sure of that?
You know every story, every wound, every memory, their whole life's happiness has been wrapped up in you, every moment...
Who?
No, I don't.
That's not him.
You're a policeman.
What are you sorry for?
That's illegal, you know.
I want to go home.
... Least of all my son. It was his irresponsibility that drove my husband to his grave.
I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes.
Okay. That's bad.
The girls threw them at me in the locker room.
I do believe they send so many boxes to taunt me. Doctor Jenner writes to them to say that my nerves are in an extremely fragile state and yet they continue to hound me with box after box after box after box after box!
It's not really important.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to upset you... but you still didn't answer the question.
Alright, I said I was sorry. Can we start over again? I think we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
Why are you being so dramatic?
I think Jos suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. And people, who are good at what they do? They have egos, too...
He didn't do it -- Nick!
Did you go riding?
We live next door.
I guess it's hard working on the road like that.
How d'you mean?
I mean, you're kind of cut off, aren't you?
I see. That beer made me dizzy.
You are so not off the hook yet, slick.
Jack...can we afford all this?
How do you even know about this place?
You have no right to...
We're at war.
It's a combat action.
I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
What?
Do what you want, it's a free country.
What do you want from me?
No, but Caesar does. He likes him. Says he's a good Italian.
You'll do it?
Sassy my foot! I'm jus' sick and tar'd a my folks tryin' to bust up. All we got lef' in the worl' is the fambly--an' right down at bottom that's all we got to have! Ef some of us dies, we can't he'p that--but ain't nobody else runnin' away!
You -- you!!
Jill.
I don't want to hear anything you've got to say.
-- there's not much room --
-- to be put in that kind of position...
We don't think marriage is important.
Well give me some then... I'm starving.
I'm still here, aren't I? See this?
You're very... kind.
About forever.
What if I say no?
You said you wouldn't laugh!
Oh I don't think so.
No, it isn't. Your name is Norman. But your younger brother -- what was his name? The one who was stung when you were younger. The one that died. The one you couldn't save. What was his name? "Mommy, we're going out to the ocean -- to go swimming." "But I don't want to go swimming, Norman. I'm scared." "C'mon, Harry, it'll be fine, it'll be fun." You heartless fuck. That's why you're so scared of the water, isn't it?
When you were in that sub -- and that squid was attacking you -- are you sure it was the squid that was attacking? Do you know? "I can't get Beth on the radio. I'm in this tiny sub on the bottom of the fucking ocean. All alone. Surrounded by all this water." Was it really the squid that was attacking you, Norman -- or was it something else -- one of your fears? You never really saw what it was, did you?
You remember before you picked him up -- when you looked up at the sphere, you remember that -- when the sphere opened? That's right. But you can't remember going inside, can you? No, of course not. Harry couldn't either, could he? "Like everything's on the tip of my tongue", he said.
You said something to him, didn't you?
...she has a home...
You wanted to get the truth.
It wasn't much of a lie.
You mean the falsely accused?
You wanted to break him.
So did I.
In Edmunds' things.
Really, I don't want to.
What is it?
I don't want to.
What is it with this? They wouldn't spend less time with Peter if they lived here! He has no time!
I know they're not much help, but they love coming here, George.
I thought we were helping.
Do you know Alyssa thinks something is up with us? She's giving me crap about being away from Peter and now you're trying to do the same thing! What no one seems to realize is that Peter isn't there! He's not there! And when he is, he isn't! So, if you don't want me here, or you don't want my kids here, just tell me, George. I'll stop coming. But it won't be because of Peter. It'll be because you asked me to stop. Say what you need to say, because I'm not leaving until I hear it.
We'll call for someone from town first thing in the morning.
-- Yeah, honey...
No... I can't... I have to... I can't...
Is there a Mr. Macaulay in the house? Oh, it's you.
The numbers stop at 107.
You think too much?
My mom drinks, too... Why do people drink, Creasy?
I know because I go in your room and check the bottles.
You don't drink like you used to.
We should have sex. It's old hat for us.
Says you were constantly calling me a slob. It's sexy that we were like a married couple, griping and overly-familiar and bored. Don't you think?
I don't care.
No.
You mean Baron von Gaigern?
Oh, yes.
A thousand marks --
Well, he's a gentleman!
Look, it's just an evening at the opera. Did I, I-I do wrong in accepting?
I'm leaving.
I know. I said that, but... he said it was something he really felt like doing.
Well, I-I-I didn't know what to say. First I said no, but then, he pressed it. He said, uh, he'd taken you once and he really wanted to invite me.
He wants to take me to see Rigoletto.
They use' to be a sayin': A chile born outa sorrow'll be a happy chile. An' another: Born outa too much joy'll be a doleful boy. That's the way I always heard it.
We'll take our check.
People don't use that word any more.
You're wrong.
He will be... When he can't write, he drinks.
I am sorry, it's so embarassing.
I'll be fine... Are you a writer, Mr Fink?
I'll tell Bill you dropped by. I'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.
Perhaps the three of us, Mr. Fink.
Why do you call it retire, why don't you call it murder?
Oh, no! I mean, everyone thinks things like that.
Sure you do. This ward is air tight, I have a little extra oxygen pumped in, keeps my spirits up.
Welcome to Rand Memorial Hospital, Mr. Gardiner.
Actually. She's kind of cool, when you get to know her.
I just want to have a child. Just...two... perfect...children...
When I told her I was going to bring her father, she kind of melted. It's the first time Felicity's talked nice to me since she left home. She's dying to meet you, Auggie.
She looks just like you.
Well?
Who do you think I was talking to?
I bet.
No!!! Stay away from me!
Hey. At least it's not an editing machine.
I didn't say a word.
Will! What--?
What about the legalities of this...?
Now I know why all the girls come here. They know how horny you guys get. But this...is ridiculous.
It's not that - I just don't want any sugar
Why did you let him in?
"On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day."
Would you wait a minute?
Yes, and very beautiful.
I have some sandwich fixings if you're hungry.
Do you swear you didn't know?
We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
Oh yes! In Muncie!
John?
What do I know? I'm just a bartender.
I m impressed. That information could have cost me 20,000.
I'm nothing but a body with a voice. No mind.
The ex-ship news' reporter. No body, no voice, all mind!
Poor little flower. Just dropped her petals and folded her tent...
I mix what I like.
Michael doesn't understand. People who make the kind of money my brother makes don't carry money on them. They keep it all in various accounts.
Look, I tried to do this thing. I know that you want me to, but it's just - You know, I'm driving down the freeway and the fuckin' thing's 'beep-beep-beep-beep'. You know, I'm in a restaurant and it's - it's embarrassing. I don't want to do it anymore. Where's Amy?
I know what ability you're interested in.
I told you I was hot tonight.
Not bad. It was slow at first, but I'm doing bits now.
Jabez -- for the good of your soul ... please come with us.
Still the man.
I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
Yeah.
I didn't realize it was that loud.
No.
Yeah, but I don't know --
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
...I mean, she knows all the music, and pop stars, and clothes and stuff. She's like still a kid, herself.
You make respectability sound... disrespectful.
... Drumlin said you're been down at Arecibo for the last year.
I have to go, I'm sorry to say --
Joe, I'm with Drew.
...Why?
No you're not!
Thanks, Steve.
If you want to go on, I can make it all right.
Chances are there's still a chance.
Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top.
Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just...
That should decide it or you --
I'm a very light sleeper, traffic noise keeps me wide awake all night.
I intend to find out.
I'm going to - - 185 West 74th Street.
I insist on being told exactly what you have in mind.
Do you have something around back, facing away from the road?
No, it can't. Good night, darling.
It may not be about anything at all.
What's this all about, Emily? I've had a very tiring day and -
I'm not faking anything. I'm looking for some bath oil...
Fire's out, isn't it?
I don't find your language that charming.
Could you?
I'd like you to leave now. Is that direct enough?
It's only two hours away.
Yes?
Sure. It'd be fun.
Fine. I'll do it myself. I was going to offer a partnership to you, but this way it's more money for me.
Exactly. Two hundred dollars a pop.
Good. We'll sell tickets.
Is this Malkovich fellow appealing?
Good to see you again, too, sir.
Mom?
I don't know... More like when I kissed Sam.
It's not what I was expecting.
Why didn't you bring him?
Oh.
He's allergic.
I really look like shit.
It's promising, this one. We're upbeat.
So. Hopeful.
It's a mess, right now. That's my project when I get back.
Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now. The replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
That whole...
Me too.
But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it.
No, thanks. I don't drink. Um, well, what'd she say? I mean, did she talk to him?
Oh.
Honey.
So we'll...radiate some more?
Well, what is your definition of following?
You followed me!
That is the worst kind of paranoia.
Do you realize how paranoid you are?
Yeah-well, you wanted to keep the relationship flexible, remember? It's your phrase.
It's really cold.
No.
I was here six years. And I only hated two.
Good night.
No thanks.
I wanna go home.
There's always a way. If people get to the Pope or the President, you can get to him.
Lina, come here!
Last night. 7:30. Big Cup. I kept calling you, but I only got your machine. I don't even know your parents line and I was really worried.
Oh. I forgot.
I'll be dog.
You scared me.
Well, go ahead, tell Jake. He's gonna kill me anyway. It's a matter of time.
You showed up. Oh, my god! Holy shit! Look at this car, man!
"Fun?" Jesus, "fun?" I kill myself for a year and a half, hand you the best case of your life on a God damn silver platter, remind you of why you became a lawyer in the first place, and you think of me as "fun?"
Molly!
You're having me on, Molly.
You've been drinking. Your tipsy.
For scaring you like I did. When I thought about what that must have seemed like that day...
What's going on? What are you doing?
John, please let me go with you! Please, John!
You do?
No...
What are you talking about?
Your baby. The baby you're carrying around inside you.
You can do whatever you want with your own life. We're thinking of the baby, that's all. We want you to get yourself cleaned up for the baby. Before it's too late.
They're not obliged to tell.
Very much.
I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
What about the guy on the very bottom?
And I'm Josephine Sarah Marcus. My friends call me Josie.
And I don't even know your full name.
Tomorrow night?
Look! Look who it is, Thelma. I'll be darned. What's he doin' way out here.
Well . . .
The girls! I don't suppose it ever occurred to you that I might go out and find myself an attractive young man . . .
Pop, I got news.
What are we going to do!?
Oh, Jesus!
I couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.
Maybe it's all the pressure, Jake. The money. Things like that. Or your wife.
It's not funny at all. One can't get intimate just off hand. I could go to England with you and everything like that -- supposing I met you next year and I said: 'How do you do, Mr. Preysing! And you said: 'That was the young lady who was my secretary in Manchester'.
What?
And?
Are you threatening me?
How can that be?
Your house is so beautiful.
Hello...this is Long Distance. I have a call from New Hampshire. Mr. Michael Corleone. One moment please.
Michael, what are you doing?
No, baby. Come to Mama.
No more than this?
I didn't say that. You aren't marriage material.
It stands so still.
What do you mean?
It's not that... it's not that...
Should you see a doctor?
It's not my time of month.
Say it!
Yes, Mother.
A few years ago one of the Sisters came to me in tears, asking for comfort, comfort because she was too old to have any children. Not that she wanted to, but once a month she had been reminded of that possibility.
For what?
I don't know. I don't know what happened Mother, I woke up... there was blood on the sheets, but I don't know what happened. I don't know what I did wrong, I don't know and I should be punished.
And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
I've had a letter from her. They've moved house.
Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. "Stay in your place, you dirty Mexican" -- that's what they tell you. But why must you say to me, "Stay in your place." Do you feel better having someone lower than you?
Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
What's that then?
So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
They said five hundred. I said six. They said the man in the gray flannel suit. I think I said, you mean the attractive guy in the gray flannel suit?
Is it because I'm here?
I want to ask you a question.
No. I want to know why you're here in Berkeley?
My daddy likes me home before dark.
Sure, sure, that doesn't count. That's different.
If you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?
Well, I guess I got it wrong, then. Seems to me I heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.
You're getting off the grift?
That's good. You don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.
Yeah? Who is this?
There are no other guests. We don't want to share this night with other people. This is for you and me.
Are you Jeffrey Pommeroy?
I am Vada Margaret Sultenfuss. My mother was...
Sure.
How'd it go today?
Diz--get what he says to the people back in that State. It's up to you and the boys. Keep those wires hot. Fire away, pal!
The war's on!
Are you in a mood today baby? Is this one of those days when you're in ...whadda call it... an emotional abyss? Talk to me, cause I don't understand these moods.
Why don't you go upstairs... take the day off. All right?...I'll cook tonight.
Well, what the hell does that mean?
I dunno..
What does that mean?
Me? I said... nothin'. I said, I said, 'No, no, no.' Everything he said, I just kept sayin' no.
Oh, well, then, have him killed and get it over with.
It's a beautiful picture of her.
What about my money?
What kind of luminous things, Bud?
Lemme fix you a drink.
Amen to that. The supermarket's full of assholes.
Too kinky.
Quit.
Is that one of your poems?
What?
Mike?
I like you too.
Come on.
I didn't sleep with him.
Wow.
He was so pissed.
That is what I want. Why don't you go and get your stuff?
So... I'm not too concerned with long term plans.
So! Let's dispense with the formalities. I want you here... now!
Don't you like me, Ben?
What?
Going home.
No, that's true.
Yessuh. Joseph Knights printshop. Vacant for thirty years.
That's good.
I do.
Hunh.
Yeah. You didn't wanna take me to the prom.
When is that?
When?
Bye.
The deal was if I came to the Opera with you you'd leave me alone forever.
There's a test, you know.
Honey?
God, I think Josh is too mature for us.
I know, look at the way he drives... he's like an old man.
Yeah, Josh, c'mon... MOVE IT!
Look, maybe that's him!
It's still twenty-five minutes early.
This is the ultimate. It's like the Taj Mahal of bad, fake 50's diners.
SHH! He's back there. I can see his hair bobbing up and down.
I want to "make love" to him.
Whacking is not of much use on a farm.
He could let you have your vacation.
Listen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head.
You know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free!
So then what, Mr. Wandering Jack?
Well, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit...
A whole ten cents?!
It's cool... but,I don't know... I went to a shrine today and all these little monk's were chanting... and, I didn't feel anything... I even tried ikebana, ... and John's using hair products... I don't know who I .
Oh, my God!
Oh ... Hi.
What's the difference?
You mean, you knew about me?
Listen to this... 'What are your mate's three most erogenous zones?'
What?
Why don't you put your mother's secret book back?
You really ought to look at this, Linda. There's a drawing on every page... and all these quizzes. It's like school.
I like to read what smart people say. So many beautiful, important things.
Yeah, I can't wait to tell Howard! It seems really appropriate.
I love quotes. So did Winston Churchill. He actually has a quotation in Bartlett's about Bartlett's. Isn't that trippy?
"The quotations when engraved upon the memory give you good thoughts."
Wouldn't penis and balls be the same category?
Okay, penis, that's one, balls...
Climax together.
All right, darling.
Oh. Sure. Of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.
Look, if I could give it to you now, I would. But it probably looks like a Sea Monkey at this point, so I think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?
She was there. She didn't by any chance happen to mention me?
I guess I'm not the right kind.
Excuse me?
Maybe you should get married. Pick one of your cousins, it would demonstrate a profound stability.
What?
Well, good, Ed. I like working with you too.
...I...
Then don't be smart.
Yup.
Oh my God. Oh my God.
It's enough -- for whatever you need, for whatever your girls need, for whatever your girls' girls need -- it'll be enough.
I can put them in a good school.
And he's making them give five million of it to you all.
Five million dollars.
I don't even know how much money that is.
How should I know?
Who?
Look, I told you I'm not going to college.
Hi.
Mama mia. Just because you were a nerd once doesn't mean it's going to happen again. That's why you have me for fashion consultation.
What do you want, Senator?
At this hour? I don't think so.
Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse.
Romantic? He rapes her.
You need help.
Yes, you are. And you must wake.
Give me a minute. I'll be right down.
It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden.
Thanks, Meurice.
You're gonna keep an eye on Marty and Ray, make sure nothing happens.
Right back to you.
Hey, I know how to have a burger by myself. I feel like a little solitude.
Well, I'll go in and have a bite.
Well, I thought I'd check if all of you were still here. I'll just go in and join the gang and you two go on.
I'm going to be number thirty-two, like Magic.
And that's not the same thing?
My Mom says she doesn't know where I come from 'cause I act different.
He works at a bank.
Uh huh.
I just can.
Oh, god.
Sarcastic, moi? Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in. It's expected any day now. I'm all packed and ready to go.
Why Memphis?
Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
No.
What?
You were... very... inspiring.
She's making this up.
His face. Allie, look at his face.
Oh, Bruce...
You are on drugs.
Nice meeting you, Knox. Bye, Gin.
You're such a retard, it was an engagement ring.
My Dad gave Shelly a ring.
Get up!?
I don't like her.
I don't remember.
Did I scowl at you?
Your evil is that you cannot be evil! And I will suffer for it no longer!
Farmers were poor in those days, that's what dad was - a farmer. I had to help out. So I quit school and I went to Milwaukee. I became a secretary. In a brewery. When you're a secretary in a brewery - it's pretty hard to make believe you're anything else. Everything is beer. It wasn't much fun, but it helped at home - and there was a Little Theater Group... like a drop of rain in the desert. That's where I met Eddie. He was a radio technician. We played 'Liliom' for three performances, I was awful - then the war came, and we got married. Eddie was in the air force - and they sent him to the South Pacific. You were with the O.W.I., weren't you Mr. Richards? That's what 'Who's Who' says... well, with Eddie gone, my life went back to beer. Except for a letter a week. One week Eddie wrote he had a leave coming up. I'd saved my money and vacation time. I went to San Francisco to meet him. Eddie wasn't there. They forwarded the telegram from Milwaukee - the one that came from Washington to say that Eddie wasn't coming at all. That Eddie was dead... ... so I figured I'd stay in San Francisco. i was alone, but couldn't go back without Eddie. I found a job. And his insurance helped... and there were theaters in San Francisco. And one night Margo Channing came to play in 'Remembrance'... and I went to see it. And - well - here I am...
I guess it started back home. Wisconsin, that is. There was just mum, and dad - and me. I was the only child, and I made believe a lot when I was a kid - I acted out all sorts of things... what they were isn't important. But somehow acting and make-believe began to fill up my life more and more, it got so that I couldn't tell the real from the unreal except that the unreal seemed more real to me... I'm talking a lot of gibberish, aren't I?
You don't have to apologize for me! I'm sorry if I hurt your feelings. It's just my way of talkin'...
There are some human experiences, Birdie, that do not take place in a vaudeville house - and that even a fifth-rate vaudevillian should understand and respect! I want to apologize for Birdie's-
Your father is dead.
Her name was Maggie Muldovan.
No, you can, you can. You've been so nice to me.
Annabelle, daddy and I will always be there. That's one time always is always. You can call him after dinner but...
What are you going to do?
That will never happen.
Then what do you think?
I am not!
You promise Wickwire a fast ticket, too?
I've had no direct communication with him since this whole thing began. And that's quite verifiable.
So the rhetoric gets you headlines. But the reality gets you in trouble.
The reality is this: We send far too many men off to war. I don't need to compound the problem with women. Can you honestly tell me you wanted that life? Squat-pissing in some third-world jungle with --
You were never going to let women serve in combat. You always had a safety net. Or thought you did.
I once promised you a fast ticket, Jordan, and I always meant to make good on that. Come work for me. I can always use a hard-charger on my team.
I wanted the choice. The chance to prove myself, my skills, my work, me. That's how it should've been.
We were such desperate sluts back then.
I wasn't accusing you, Ben. It's just that we've got to be honest. Not just with ourselves, but with the children.
That must have been when my dad was married to Maxine...
Actin' like what?! How am I supposed to act? 'Scuse me for not knowing what to do after you blow somebody's head off!
Why are you actin' like this?
Hmmm. We gotta get some money.
I'm cash poor.
I hardly know him. I saw him only once, some years ago. I can't even remember him.
What do you mean?
Just what the hell is wrong with you?
Well, when you figure it out, wake me up.
Oh, I don't know. I'm just nervous. I gotta figure out what to do.
Kinda.
I am the Princess of Wales.
Knox, you are so infuriating!
Let go of me...
Uh-uh.
I know. I get it. What's Matthew doin'?
The wind will be with us! Do as I say.
Sort of.
Who?
Claire?
What's that fucker ever done for us?
They're bad for you. They cause...red lips.
What?
Nixon, doofus! It's incredible. He should be shot.
So special. Because I was the only one. You both wanted me to be so good at everything, so perfect and I wasn't. I was just me. And now I've completely ruined everything, anyway...
Charles.
Not simple, no.
You're not going to --
This just isn't the best moment for this.
That this was going to be a key party?
Well?
Damn it, Ben --
Then I suppose it'd be insurrection, and I suppose I'd have to kill you. I suppose.
Damn it! You can t fucking walk away from this!
Promise me you'll come back.
How are you gonna make it without your shoes?
Aren't you being a little hard?
- that's what I mean!
Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...
Is that the technical description of what I've got?
We don't discuss it.
Mom's such a cutie.
She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about.
I think that you might go and have a look yourself.
I don't see why I should mind.
Calm?... He doesn't seem so to me... He was awake all night.
What amazes me, is Sandro. He seems so calm.
Steady Marlon!
Goodbye! See you!
I'll bet you're a real yo yo.
A new disease.
What kinds of questions?
Don't bother.
Great.
Yes, you did, Daniel! I saw it from the window. And then to lie about it! Give me that beanshooter, Daniel!
I'm going out later.
Can you try?
Oh, hi. Look, I'm running a little late, but I'll still...
Oh.
I think he's running for town crier next year.
I understand. That's very kind of you.
Eve. I've heard the most wonderful things about your performance-
There's a light up ahead.
You take charge.
Except for about six pages. You've got a flashback there ...
Is there someplace we can talk?
I didn't.
I felt a little guilty, so I got out some of your old stories.
It's for Shelly's famous potato salad.
Lucky Pop isn't home, he'd kill you.
What?
Yeah.
Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.
Okay?
How do you expect to get anything done if you allow yourself to get sidetracked? Particularly in your business... you deal with women every day...
Oh, Lestat. I must do more than that. I've brought a present for you.
I don't want to talk about it. I want you to go.
Do you have anything to drink?
How far is it to California?
Have you ever been there before?
Is that what changed your mind? The money?
It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
It's my mother.
I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
What?
Oh, this isn't my car. It's down a ways. I should have parked closer. I just didn't think it would be so heavy. I could drive up.
It's very nice of you to help me. That package is kind of heavy, and it's so hot.
You should be more careful.
What happened to your hand?
So you were having sex with the little fella, then?
Is there anything else you can tell me about him?
A private investigator?
He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
Yes.
No.
Certainly not!
Is that true?
Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
Who is it?
What did you stop it for?
I live for midnight, when I can tear another of those suckers off. Watcha got for me?
Oh, no, I have a car.
No. The Pill will be for birth control. But girls do like sex. Maybe not the first time.
How can you just walk around like that, in front of all these people?
Ed, this isn't the real world! You've surrounded yourself with WEIRDOS!
Al ain't a-goin' away, an' you gonna tell him he ain't a-goin' away. An' if you think diff'unt, you gotta whup me first. So some on.
Well, you ain't a-goin'! Ain't nobody else a-goin'! We got here an' we gonna stay here, together! As long as we got the fambly unbroke I ain't scared, but it's a long bitter road we got ahead of us-- --an' I'm here to tell ya ef anybody else tries to bust us up anymore I'm a-goin' cat wild with this here piece a bar-arn!
We haven't even begun tea yet.
I can't give up looking for her, Mrs. Redi, no matter what you're hinting at.
Why?
I don't believe it.
So there is only one key...
I don't need lodgings if we're to be marching on Orleans...
I didn't wait long. One day I was going to Mass, like I do every day, when the same strange wind started blowing again...
He said that I have to save France from her enemies and give her back to God, and He told me that I -- Jeanne -- will lead you to the altar at Rheims to be crowned King of France.
That can't be, I have all the classic symptoms.
These are not the kind of movies I go to.
But this is a porno movie.
What's wrong?
Oh God, Patrick. Shut up.
A facial at Elizabeth Arden, which was really relaxing, then to the Pottery Bam where I bought this silver muffin dish.
Yeah. All over.
...I m Emily Stewart. The hysterical female who sees evil everywhere since the day her thirteen year-old boy disappeared. The pain in the ass who cries wolf at the drop of a hat. However I go about this that s who I am. Do you get what I m fucking saying, Mr Lombard?
Open this door!
I'm bloody dressing as fast as I can, for God's sake!
So, tell me about yourself. If you can get your mind out of the gutter long enough, dog-boy.
Good. Now we're getting somewhere. Not a chance.
I mean, I am really attracted to you. Jesus, you are a fag. We can share recipes, if you like, Darlene.
You're a fag or a liar.
Maybe it would be a good idea if you just took Michael.
Hi, Dusty.
What's a prom?
What does it look like ... I'm collecting empties.
What parcel?
A heavy Christmas present.
You didn't show it to anybody?
Patients are rationed to one pack of cigarettes a day.
Please see to Mister Bromden.
Now you boys hurry along and wash up for breakfast... You too, Mister McMurphy.
After breakfast, Mister McMurphy, after breakfast.
You're not.
Well, I was sure you'd want to, of course, being his birthday, and you've been so busy these past few days, and last night I meant to tell you before you went out with the Richards - and I guess I was asleep when you got home...
I still feel...
Oh, very jealous.
I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay. It's hard to tell with her.
Just did. Jealous?
Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job.
In Cheyene Walk? Lucy's going to have a meltdown. Oh, I'm so sorry.
So how are you really doing, Panes?
Getting loud, getting loud.
... all those voices... you gather them all together. Millions of intelligences in one consciousness... and now we're a part of it.
Everyone I know has met her, Viktor.
I have to go.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yes.
I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word "farm" means to her?
Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think --
You mean a farm?
Well. What kinda job is it?
Tennessee?
Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman.
I don't know. But Johnny, how did your mother recover? She was dying.
Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the steeple. One if by land--two if by sea!... Okay! Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel Boone's lost !
Well, he just gets on about how if mama ever needed him, she could find him through the National Geographic magazine. He as a photographer. He promises not to write again. Then all it says is... I love you... Robert.
No. Aaron and I go to Central America on Wednesday -- so I'm cramming.
You weren't. Thanks. How does it feel being here?
Used to what?
Hard to argue with that, isn't it...
There goes your stereo for another year. Mike Damone is a no-brain little prick. I'm not letting him get away with this.
What about the plane?
Then I called his house, and his mother told me he was in the garage helping his father.
See, in that crisis, I saw an opportunity. For some real growth.
Yes, yes -
I don't know if I can picture Uncle Phil body surfing.
That he be cremated and his ashes thrown on Roseman Bridge.
That's correct -- but Andrew never told me he had a heart condition. He said he had a heart arrhythmia and it was nothing serious.
But I thought high school is only four years.
What year are you in?
Cecile's attending Oakwood in the fall.
My father just took me on a trip to Australia.
I have his journal.
I'll call you later and we'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Wh-wh-who did you kill first?
That would be some trick. He's already dead. That's what this other letter is. From his attorney. He left most of his things to mama and requested...
Are we understood?
I'm going with you.
Leon could still have hung himself.
No. No, it all depends on what offers I get.
Who is it?
Out.
Can you lift the furnace. I need money.
I said, I've seen it before.
You know him?
Okay? He's not here?
We could leave, and live in the superstructure....
And so, in a blazing fury, Charles runs Lancelot Trelawney through with his sword . . . leaving Deborah free to accept Charles's proposal of marriage!
So what's my share of the dress?
You know?
I'm starting to sense that now.
Well, of course not! I know how dangerous this is. But I would trust Mister Hebbing with anything. Wouldn't I, darling?
Oh, I told Mister Hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!
He's going to wish he was dead.
