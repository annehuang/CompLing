Clifton - your wife - do you think it's appropriate to leave her?
I think the desert is, it's - for a woman - it's very tough, I wonder if it's not too much for her.
Safe journey.
All the same, I, were I you I would be concerned -
Well, hell, son, it's got a certain ring to it, I'll say that.
I don't think it's funny.
Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
Travelin' like this, you kinda lose track of what's goin' on in the world.
Thanks.
Holy Smokes! You'll never get out yourself! Better phone for some help.
Say, Buddy
What's up?
Looks like we're going to be stuck for a long time.
Duffy! Get Liebowitz!
I am...
Those stamps -- they're worth a fortune!
What?
Closed?
Jennyhaydn.
Who is he? Who is she? Who are you? Who am I? Who are you?
Because that's where the fire is?
Yeah.
Then we both know. I'll point. You drive. Faster.
What the -- ?!
Fire is like a living thing. Wild. Unpredictable.
Well! Looks like about ten years apiece for you birds!
What's he up to?
This is the Morning Post you're talking to!
A fortune! Hurry -- we've got to find him!
It won't always be like this. I love you, Fran.
Oh.
I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace! Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you...
Forever. We used to live on the same island in Greece, when we were kids.
I know, I know! But this is a way to get into that castle...
Two words.
Bring it along.
You want to go for a ride?
Yeah, well, I'm going to work as a cowboy now... Or thinking about it. It's a routine, like anything. What do you think?
How do you say "Quit my Job" in Spanish?
Just seemed like the right move... Whatcha doing?
Go figure you.
Doctor's orders.
Look, Nick. You want us to pack up, we'll pack up.
There's always another girl.
The flu.
What're you doing?
Just until we find another girl.
Oh no.
This just got a hell of a lot better.
No, no, I'm not done! I've got reserves! Nadia, please please please. I'm begging you.
I'm worried too. I'm worried that the only reason I'm here getting my brains blown loose is that you weren't asshole enough to get my ten million three months ago.
You don't like Miss Lawson much do you?
The office is filled with people who want their memories re-erased.
Excuse me Miss Daniel?
It puzzles me so badly. I've done terrible things but I can't consider myself a terrible man. I've killed three people and I'd still want to say it was accident, do you see?
Tom Grunemann discovered me -- we were here on business together, he discovered me with Jane McKenna. Then I suppose it was the -- the contempt I saw in his face and the certainty that sooner or later he'd use it against me. Within the Company. I endured that as long as I could, do you see?
Huh?
Free verse, huh? What the dickens was free about it? It cost this paper a gob of dough. Well, I'm here to tell you, it's not gonna cost us any more.
Say, listen, you wouldn't know a story if it reached up and kicked you in the pants. Yeah? Sure, sure, I got your copy. Why didn't you tell me you were going to write it in Greek? I'd start a new department.
What's with the dark?
Last week I was playing the piano for him and he likes it, and so I decide I'm going to make a little joke...
You just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. Not Tom, you said, the Dumper was clearly not Tom.
I could try Arlyn Page again. She saw much more of the Dumper than Bree Daniel.
It's got to make sense some way.
Then, close the case.
It's where it doesn't get me. I've got nothing left that connects to anything.
Where, how?
I better keep looking.
I want to! Come on!
I'm flying back out to Pennsylvania Friday; I'll fill them in on things.
There's Ransohoff's. Nothing but the best. Come on.
Okay. Now we're going to buy you some clothes.
Nervous! Why should I be nervous?
I'll be all right. I've got Asta to protect me.
Where s my car?! Where s my Ferrari!?
No. Not like you.
Either you're a member of the club or you aren't, Elton. Tell me what you know...
Won him over just like that.
You've got a deal.
No, I am. I am.
Oil pressure. I forgot to check the oil pressure. When Kramer hears about this, the shit's gonna hit the fan.
Rats! I've lost number three.
Yes?
Don't worry. We'll take it out of your share.
All right, you get out of here, man!
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc. Gimme that again, will yuh? Who's gonna get him?
Who are they?
Hey. Who'd you say was gonna get him?
Sure. Mostly often.
It's really not all your fault. I was talking to Mike earlier and he had a lot of problems. Personal things, you know. Made some bad investments. At least now he's peaceful...
Jack...
Uh, yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
Yeah. I'm not the one who's in love with the guy.
To bed.
Yes, you do!
Have you?
Because you didn't love him --
But you didn't hurt --
How did you feel when I told you Johnny Boz had died -- that day at the beach.
How did you feel when he died?
Even though you were fucking him.
You have trouble, financial trouble?
There's not a reason on earth why you should.
Yeah-- after I shoot you through the fucking forehead I'm gonna fuck you in the bullethole.
Nice talk, Sugarmouth.
You look beautiful.
You said Trask was arranging laboratory work. Police laboratory. Anything from that?
Come on--let's take a swim.
Hell, baby, I don't know what to say.
At first it was real strange. Hell, Japan is a long ways from Alabama. Really got under my skin, though. Almost didn't come back.
You can live that down, can't you?
You're totally gone, aren't you?
I don't believe in little floating people! THERE IS NO MAGIC!
So what? You going to help me?
I'm self-centered, I'm weak - I don't have the will power of a fly on shit...
That's why the Little People sent you. Just like magic.
He knows who you are! He's afraid! I can tell!
WILL YOU PLEASE... please listen to me ... You know none of this is true - PARRY the Grail, the voices... Jack... There's a part of you that Come on...what are knows this isn't true. saying... I know who you are... I know who you are.. or who you were. You're acting really- You don't belong on the No, no, no, no... streets. You're intelligent Jack... man....you're a teacher... Jacck!... You were a teach at Hunter College. Don't you remember?...
I don't believe it.
Sure, I can. Look at the policy I gave him! "With this ring I thee wed and with all my worldly goods I thee endow: And thereto I plight thee my troth."
Hildy, darling!
Sorry, the name's Adam Canfield.
It'll be Heaven!
What are you so damn angry about? Did somebody turn into a wild beast and rip your intestines out? Huh?
Aaaaa!!! Get the fuck away from me!
I'm afraid she's not so lucky. She's undead. And so am I.
No it isn't! You're dead!
She came to help, Howard.
You stop growing that loco weed at your place, you'd see a lot more daylight.
Three months.
How much you got left?
Time marches on.
Hey, Pete. How's it going?
What's the...OH SHIT!
You don't?
It was a very emotional time for Buttercup --
It's too dangerous.
What is it, Tommy?
Yeah...and maybe more important, if you believe in yourself.
Absolutely.
Stay here, I'll be back.
Is this the guy with the Mustang?
Bledso
What's that?
Oh, no! But, Uncle Billy . . .
Why did you do that?
Well I can't.
I can't see why you did, unless... you didn't have to marry him or anything, did you?
Oh no. You had to marry him because you got pregnant?
Well I never thought of you and Mr. Robinson as the kind of people who...
Sorry, Diane isn't here at the moment.
You're jo- Whatta yuh kid- What did you do, grow up in a Norman Rockwell painting?
Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
Jim Court?
Hindsight. It's like foresight without a future.
I got two minutes.
Surely, come right in.
It's a copy of the plaque NASA sent into space on the Pioneer probes.
Recognize this?
Any reports about monsters, people in Halloween masks, anything like that?
You have yourself a few flings this summer. I bet you're quite a ladies' man.
Is it real? You people are sick.
That's great coming from you.
I played the cards I was dealt, Wyatt. Your problem is you're Always trying to play someone Else's. Allow me to tell you the Truth and thus set you free: There is no happiness, Wyatt There is no normal life. There's Only life, that's all. Just life. The rest is relative.
All I ever wanted was to live a Normal life.
All right. Then what?
Run. Take that girl and start Running. Run and don't look back. All your life you been running And looking back and just barely Existing and calling it getting By. This time run and don't look Back and call it living. Live Every second, live it right up to The hilt. Live, Wyatt... Live for me.
Then what do I do?
First you can grab that black- Haired woman and make her your own.
It's all right -- You're my guest.
Why didn't I think of that?--I am going to scout around and see if I can find her.
I don't have anyone to talk to things about and I understand it's confidential with a doctor - I'm embarrassed about that and I don't want my sisters to know?
Well I'm sorry. Before...
And I'm sorry that I did that.
I wanted to ask you because you're a doctor, right?
I don't like the way I am sometimes. Can you help me? WALTER Barry, I'm a dentist, what kind of help do you think I can give you?
I know that. Maybe you know other doctors?
Put your shoulders back.
That's amazing. I-I-I... I've been goin' for fifteen years, I-you know, I don't got... nothing like that in-
Tsch. Rea- All this happened in the first hour?
M'hm.
G-go on, I'm interested.
Me? I'm-I'm one of the few males who suffers from that, so, so... you know.
I know. Hey Nadia.
I'll save you a seat.
You can send me the address too.
Well...dammit, if I'm doing this, how the hell am I gonna watch?
Dad.
I can't follow you, Gaston, isn't it about time that you realized the unfairness of your position? You being my servant? Wouldn't you like to stand on an equal footing with me?
Isn't there any revolt in you? Sometimes when I order you around don't you feel like kicking me in the pants?
Oh, you're a reactionary! Don't you look forward to the day when you can come in here and stand square on your two feet and say, "Hey, you, d'Algout! from now on it's going to be share and share alike"?
I got released.
If you know where she is, tell me where my wife is.
I don't know how you know these things, but tell me where is she?
I don't wanna go, Sam.
It means, "Never without my permission".
Excuse me! Just one thing! She said something to me a while ago and... I don't really get it... Akta Gamat?
A coyote.
There aren't any coyotes in England.
Could be a lot of things.
Yeah?
I heard that.
What was it?
Did you hear that?
The Hound of the Baskervilles.
Pecos Bill.
Well it was a friend's idea, really, and the record release party seemed like a good place to do it. So... I should really put a James Brown in there --
Is that it?
Sure, but is that it for the list?
Can I go home and work this out and let you know? In a week or so?
Oh, I'm sure I can manage something... "Sin City." "New Rose," by The Damned. "Hit It and Quit It" by Funkadelic. "Shipbuilding," Elvis Costello, Japanese import, no horns, or different horns, anyway... um... "Mystery Train" by Elvis Presley... And... "Spaced Cowboy" by Sly and the Family Stone. A bit controversial, I know, but...
I'm askin' ya to go to him -- As a favor.
Nobody. The author.
Who is that?
Who are you, master?
Hey, this is fun.
Black.
'Here'?
Here...
Incidentally, Joe, where're you staying?
Uh - will that hold you, Joe?
What do you mean?
No no. I knew.
No, I'm just... anxiously looking past it. I already had my bachelor party. It was called "my twenties." See you later.
I appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...
Thank you.
So I hope you won't mind my giving you a friendly piece of advice.
Yes, sir.
In many ways I feel as though you were my own son.
I'd like to hear it.
Ben -- I think -- I think you ought to be taking it a little easier right now than you seem to.
Mrs. Robinson, don't wreck it. I'm asking you please not to wreck it.
I just don't believe you would do that.
Listen, I hope ya don't --
Then why'd you ask?
Maybe.
Busy
Do what?
Your conversation has one marvelous advantage, Swana. However many questions you ask you never expect an answer.
Good morning, Swana.
Did you go home with him?
How long were you having sex with him?
Did you leave the club with him?
Were you with him last night?
I travel every week. College ball, motor sports, training camps...
I think you're kidding yourself, Clara. I used to think about moving out, you know? And that's what I used to say. "My mother needs me." But when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. Actually, you need your father. You know what I mean? You're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that -- being a little girl all your life.
Why don't you just move out to Portchester?
Depends if my date wants to stop by.
That junior chick?
Stifler!!
You coming to party tonight, Ostreicher, ya fuckface?
Nah, gave her the Heisman. I'm working on something new.
Yeah right. I got an idea for something new. How 'bout you guys actually locate your dicks, remove the shrink wrap, and fuckin' use 'em.
She works part-time at my dad's store.
Hah! Yeah, Oz, I bet it's more like your dad works at her store.
I'll get my car and be back in half an hour.
Just dinner.
What?
This looks familiar...
That's what counts. If you're not passionate about it, don't waste your time. That's why I quit college... Plus I'm a lazy bastard. Wait, I know this... A votre sante.
So tell me, exactly which truck driver did you study English with?
Like I should talk. Monsieur foot-in- the-mouth. I'm really sorry about that whole Woody Allen thing...
Shit.
On what?
Why should I take a chance?
Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks on you?
Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
Oh, I've got to earn them, and you'll help me, won't you?
By letting me help you.
I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings.
Yes!
So it's love which drags you to Moscow.
I must get into that country of yours!
No visa.
That's impossible! Nobody has the right.... You can't do that!... If you don't give me that visa...
Oh no. No visa.
Now look here... you advertise all over the world that you want people to go into your country and when someone tries to get in, you keep him out!
You're going to force us... huh?
The Sha-lin masters from east and west must unite!
Come on.
Guys, guys -- you're ruining my fucking moment here. Now think about it --
No, I'm sorry, I'm not goin'- I can't... I don't wanna go on after that comedian.
I know, but think about it -- At the parties that night. Chicks are gonna want to do it.
Gibarian.
Do you?
What do you want?
Can it work?
You're crazy. That's a pretty silly game.
If you'd grant me a final favor, I'd like the chance to explain myself --
You've tried it? Isn't it true that you've been in and out of Rehab centers for the last four years?
Hi.
They're gonna rape the maid, aren't they.
Okay.
Every Tom, Dick, and Harry thinks he can write. But a journalist gets in there, right where the bombs are. He's aggressive. Grabs the bull by the balls.
Yes, that's right.
I cashed in all of my money, paid my AmEx card, gonna sell the car tomorrow.
No, I came here to drink... myself... you know...
Yeah. And your meter just ran out.
I think about four weeks, and I've got enough for about two hundred and fifty to three hundred dollars a day.
You know what separates us office flunkies from the reporters?
Who are you going to see?
Why?
I can't go to the club tonight, guys.
Ha.
How do you know about that?
Un-fucking-believable. Dick's out on a hot date, Rob's boning Marie LaSalle, and the best-looking and most intelligent of all of us isn't getting anything at all.
Nobody.
Anna.
Oh come on, Rob. What am I, an idiot? I'm more bothered by Dick's thing. How did this happen, Dick? What rational explanation can there possibly be? What's her name?
How'd you know?
I just got it fixed.
I know, I was wrong. But Morg, Look, we got to get out.
I am usin' it, Wyatt. Been Wonderin' how the hell we got in This tangle. You know they hit Clum's house, too? Shot up his wife. His wife. Who ever heard of That? Men sneakin' around in the Dark, back-shootin', scarin' Women? They're bugs, Wyatt. You Know all your smart talk about Live and let live? Ain't no live And let live with bugs.
Morg, use your head.
What's it look like? They want a Piece of me they can come and get It, I'm not crawlin' into my hole.
Morgan, are you crazy? They're Out gunning for us! What the Hell're you doin'?
Get down, boy.
You're aware, are you not, that it costs a great deal to house your husband at Charenton...
Perhaps if you were to buttress your entreaties with the means to oblige them...
That barely covers the cost of his room. There's nary a penny left over for appropriate treatments. Opiates to quell his temper. Restraints to chasten him when he misbehaves.
Thanks. It does, the more you know who you are... you don't care about things the same way...
Took the words right out of my mouth. Go on... I'll be right with you. It's our honeymoon. We're going to use the trip to get to know each other better.
You what?
Your husband?
Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
No, see, Clem, I assume you fucked someone tonight. Isn't that how you get people to like you?
Let me drive you home.
And what are you like? A wino?
Look at it out here. It's falling apart. I'm erasing you. And I'm happy.
Oh no, I don't think --
Pull heat on me? -- I'll dent ya face!
Absolutely no idea. Remembering one name's bad enough...
Sharp -- Real nice.
He does. Here's your quarter, Brett.
We're leaving.
You see, Captain, the situation is not as much under control as you believe.
Captain Renault, are you entirely certain which side you're on?
My dear Major, we are trying to cooperate with your government, but we cannot regulate the feelings of our people.
I knew she had it.
Real early. We're just gonna take your car to get some breakfast.
We'll just be a minute. Get a little more sleep.
Even Cupid's becoming modern, using medicine balls instead of darts.
I'm going to be here a few more days. I'll be at the Inn. We have some time. Let's not say any more now.
I CAN'T SAY GOODBYE YET! We'll leave it for now. We're not saying goodbye. We're not making any decision. Maybe you'll change your mind. Maybe we'll accidentally run into each other and ... and you'll change your mind.
Do you work in Justice Zinnowitz' office?
Good night.
Moreover --
Moreover...
Do it.
Ahh, it's too late, anyway. It's too late. Listen, I could shoot my way out, maybe take one of them with me... If you'd gimme my gun back.
My change.
And that I can drive a truck!
I guess you have your reasons.
I like you as much as I can like anyone who thinks I'm an asshole.
We can go together.
Oh my God.
What?
Mrs. Robinson -- if you don't mind my saying so -- this conversation is getting a little strange. Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will be here any minute and --
Look -- I think I should be going --
What?
You!!
Happy Birthday, Bill.
I don't know. I'm not exactly the nine-to-five type.
Not exactly.
Thank you.
To front for him. So Elliot is workin' out the deal between them and his boss, a big movie producer named Lee Donowitz.
He produced "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
Suspect's words -
Uh-huh.
Look for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything.
How about another beer?
I have to ask.
I see the Prince of Wales is here.
Oh -- hello, Mr. McCleery.
-- suddenly there she was without any clothes on -- I mean really naked --
-- and when we got up in the room she starts taking her her clothes off -- and --
All right -- but listen to me. What happened was there was this party at my parents. I drove your mother home -- then we went upstairs to see your portrait --
Elaine -- that is not what happened.
Who is? But then you gotta look at a job as more than just work. You gotta look at it as peace of mind. As security, you know what I mean? I got offices in Detroit, Miami, Boston, take your pick.
Why should you be afraid?
Oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?
That's even better.
Do you go to school?
Cool, can I get one for Vada?
Her assistant?
Kate Reynolds...
You too? This holiday's about giving, Adelle. And I'm giving everything I've got to this deal, so in a way, I'm more Christmassy than anyone... Lifesaver?
My ex-wife's in Miami. It's nice down there.
Kate Reynolds was my girlfriend in college. I almost married her...
Now Hank, are you sure they're coming? It will be lonesome without them. Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
Help you out?
Who, Bingy? Yeah, Bingy would. He never saw fifty dollars before. You could have bought him for six bits. Funny thing about Bingy. The more he gets - the more he prints. He looks stupid, doesn't he? But oh how smart he gets when he bends over a typewriter.
The man from the Tribune seemed perfectly satisfied.
Good.
I have it here.
I came on at 8:00.
You all right?
Got him here?
I'm her bodyguard, goddamnit...
She bought it.
I don't know why she bought me a tie! -- She's a generous person -- and she's a nice person -- and I could be settin' her up to be killed... you want the fuckin' tie?
No need to decide now. Be like the fish. Let whatever happens happen.
Same to you.
Nothing's changed. You know, we never finished that gin game --
Fine.
What does it mean?
Oh, Miss Kubelik. How do you feel?
Oh?
Off me or off you?
You mean, leaving his wife? Yeah. I'm very happy for you.
That's right.
Let's do that.
Brave... that's right.
Let's be happy that we're all alive.
Get in. This side.
Fine.
The power.
We seek the ogre, Baron Couer de Noir. He slew a unicorn and plunged the world into eternal winter.
We seek to undo the curse.
My God! Look!
I've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. I forgot to phone Mel Kaufman.
I threw them into the garbage, which was perhaps immoral, but I wanted to come to you clean, so to speak. I thought we could go shopping and pick up a pair of jeans and forty- five pairs of underwear and just throw them out each day.
Yeah, RIGHT.
I'm going to fill it right now.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy! When is the sidewalk fully dressed? When it's 'wearing' Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha!
We're goin' to, Lula, real soon.
Went with Bobby.
Uh-huh?
You talk to 'im some?...
Oughta make 'em happy.
TAXI!!!
She's working. I need a break anyway. She's getting a little clingy. This is our day!
I say, do what you wanna do.
No THANKS!
I'll have the tournedos of beef. And the lady will have the same? I assume you're a carnivore.
"Who ever lov'd that lov'd not at first sight?"
Not really. You're not my client. Freedom of association. Big issue with the First Amendment fans. Want to go to Hawaii for the weekend?
No.
Look at that sky. It's so big.
It's a damn easy thing to play with.
Shut up--I like this song... April in Paris, this is a feeling, No one can ever reprieve...
And beyond the blue is the blackness of the cosmos.
C'mon, Meat. You can't hit me 'cause you're starting to think about it already, you're starting to think how embarrassing it'll be to miss, how all these people would laugh. C'mon, Rook--show me that million dollar arm 'cause I'm getting a good idea about the five cent head--
Are you talking about exercise? Like gym?
I'll cut it in half. Four guys, but that's it.
Three.
And you met Mary how?
Did Mr. Marsh use drugs?
I'm starving.
I've got Jews at my table.
What's the thing?
Okay -- well, thank you. I don't know what it's for. But thank you anyway.
Thank you. Shall I...
Fine. Everything much the same. When they change the law Spike and I will marry immediately. Whereas you... I've watched in wonder. Awards, glory ...
Seventeen months ago I was posting a walk in Lisbon, and he was there. He never saw me. But I saw him, though.
Yeah, right. Anyway, that scene where Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway get shot? I remember thinking at the time it wouldn't be a bad way to go, if you have to.
This other couple that we're here with, do you know them very well?
Yeah, I liked her in that movie about TV...
Nice.
Whatever.
What the fuck is that?
So you want to go swimming?
Dave -- I'm working.
Thanks.
The who?
Go on. Tell me more about her.
I'll make the soap myself.
Will she be dark or fair?
Write me a poem?
Not yet.
Some sacrifices are worth it.
I wouldn't say it was terrible...it was...kind of...
I tell you again, I don't want any part of it. Now you take Dorothy home and...
I don't even know if it is my book. The Bedouin found it in the plane, in the wreckage. It's mine now. I heard your breathing and thought it might be rain. I'm dying for rain - of course I'm dying anyway - but I long to feel rain on my face.
Why do I feel if I had your book I would know everything?
I can't hide anymore. I breathe like a dog. I lose my balance. Stealing's got harder. Caravaggio stares at the Herodotus.
Are you outside? A beat and then Caravaggio shuffles in. Like an old boxer.
Yes, ma'am. A lot of water under the bridge.
...That man's takin' his job too serious.
See you later.
Goodbye, M'sieu Filiba.
Well, who says life is fair? Where is that written? Life isn't always fair.
What does that mean? You've been thinking about the case? Or you thought everything out before you killed Marsh?
What do you think you were in your previous life, Amy?
How's it coming?
Yes, really. I don't want you to be unhappy, Jack. If you say it's out of tune, it's out of tune.
Really.
What's it look like I'm doing? I'm tuning a goddamn piano.
How long you been at it?
Fine.
Go on - you can have one!
Are they moulting now?
Yes, I see. About those lovebirds, Miss...
How can you tell?
I'm freezing my ass off.
I don't know-- he doesn't exactly confide in me.
Maurice is gonna kill him, try and collect the reward.
He's supposed to be, but he hasn't shown up yet, which is a good thing for him.
Really?
I'll send Cardoza, he'll be able to...
It's a fact. Sicilians have nigger blood pumpin' through their hearts. If you don't believe me, look it up. You see, hundreds and hundreds of years ago the Moors conquered Sicily. And Moors are niggers. Way back then, Sicilians were like the wops in northern Italy. Blond hair, blue eyes. But, once the Moors moved in there, they changed the whole country. They did so much fuckin' with the Sicilian women, they changed the blood-line for ever, from blond hair and blue eyes to black hair and dark skin. I find it absolutely amazing to think that to this day, hundreds of years later, Sicilians still carry that nigger gene. I'm just quotin' history. It's a fact. It's written. Your ancestors were niggers. Your great, great, great, great, great-grandmother was fucked by a nigger, and had a half-nigger kid. That is a fact. Now tell me, am I lyin'?
Absolutely.
Yep. I didn't think it was that big, but it's a major spider. You got a broom or something with a-
Two... Yeah. Lotta, lotta trouble. There's two of 'em.
What was your father's name?
Of course it'll work. You can get another girl to fill out the act.
What will we do?
Will it?
I believe that, don't you?
'Love will find out the way'?
Elaine, I've come to apologize for Lt. McElroy. He overstated the department's position.
But... if you had to guess?
Elaine, I don't want to have to take you in for questioning. You've got his car, you were the last to see him
A single. Just for myself, please.
I don't need a doctor, I need a different job.
Sorry--but I'm on a vacation--
Maybe ya should see a doctor.
Could be...But I don't like this business. It smells fishy to me.
They're Bavarian Death style pretzels.
Hey... you got a fine one right here!
Why did you park way back there?
Then just help me find a girlfriend! That's all I ask. I'll give you every single card I've got left!
Would you do it just because you're my friend? My very best friend.
I certainly do!
No it's not!
Is anything wrong, sir?
It gets worse -- you still have your freshman yearbook?
Luggage? Yes. Yes. I do.
It s an unbelievable thing. Wearing this suit actually makes me feel like a better person. I m gonna buy it...
She got those shoes...
How did you see me?
Look, baby - I don't know 'bout you, but it's the right thing for me. I just know it is. So, what d'you say?
No, ma'am.
I know!
Parry, it's Lydia Sinclair - our membership winner.
There's one thing about this wedding I want you to do. Call this number. It's a business number. Ask for Ronny. Invite him to the wedding.
Not at all.
Good night to you, Bill.
Someone's loaning it to him. Get on it right away.
Goddamit! Where is he getting the money to fight?
Put the pension funds on hold until I say otherwise.
Our contract guys are working on the Kross pension funds. There's another forty million there. We can bleed'm dry.
I loved it.
Hello. I'm Joe Black. Nice to meet you.
It's for you. In a couple weeks you'll get the itch so bad, you'll be working for nothing.
Hello, Mary?
Listen, Buddy, the shit that's about to go down, you'll be on the phone with your sister for a month. Let me do this part alone.
-- You've got to listen to me. Do you have any idea what you'd have to look forward to if you stayed here? Nine chances out of ten we'd both wind up in a concentration camp. Isn't that true, Louis?
You better not either.
What have you done to her?
You can't stop me from seeing her, Mrs. Robinson. I'll find her.
What the hell have you done?
I'll find her.
We know what it is, Al.
What are we going to do about it, Al?
Yes, but the curtains were drawn.
Can't we move any faster?
Tis a delicate operation, lad. Requires a bit of engineering... Next!
Ah, but you will. And so will the Baron, when we bring a little light to his dark hideaway.
That's more like the old Sally--a little bit of fire. How about Ned?
Patience, lad.
Hey! Stop it! I can't see.
A tipoff in the right quarter to take his fingerprints and--
You say you were in the room with the body from the time you discovered it 'til we came?
I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
You look better than ever.
I don't think Mom cares that much that my...that Peter left.
Not a perfect day.
Good work, my son. Now all we need is a way to get there.
She seemed upset.
What's wrong with your back?
Is that right?
No deal.
As long as I get the laugh.
Well -- I don't know.
I want to gamble.
May I have twenty-five cents, please?
That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
No, it doesn't.
Give him some good exercise? Sure Some stud. Some string in fact. What're you gonna do, race 'em?
Come up to the fire, honey.
You -- oh, you mean -- yeah, East Lansing and Ann Arbor.
I know. Salt and pepper?
Well, you're not. Oil and vinegar?
Well, I mean, business is okay, and lacrosse is awesome, but what am I gonna be, a pro lacrosse player? I really have no idea.
Well, State's got a good business school. And I can probably walk onto the lacrosse team. Green peppers?
A share of the profits.
But I have to pay the actors and the authors.
Well, you're at the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong woman.
I'll be the judge of that.
Good title.
Yes, I saw you see me.
I couldn't sleep.
I'm sorry to hear that.
...Maybe I better forget it.
You ballin' her?
But it's a great story. Somewhere in this country a guy is walking into twenty million bucks.
I thought all for the best.
Kid, you gave them what they wanted. This committee, it feeds on names. The more names, the better. But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do.
Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that.
Call from the motel and tell him if he moves fast enough there might be something left of a body dissolving in acid. Can I have the keys to your house?
Not any more.
Why not?
Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did. You think they're gonna let me write pictures? Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail.
Not at all.
Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore.
What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter?
Peter, I'm an agent. I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you. That's what I do. You're a writer. You write pictures. That's what you do. And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning.
What do you mean?
Newspaperman?
It must be one o'clock.
A Plague o' both your houses.
I didn't "shoplift the pooty." We were thrown together and -- I mean it's two mutual people who -- Alright, I shoplifted the pooty.
No. A real man does not shoplift the "pooty" from a single mom.
I'm dropping the case.
He was only doing what he thought was right.
Rebecca -- we shattered a man's life in open court.
You don't need anybody.
You killed him -- didn't you?
I'll fill page after page, I promise.
Take your pen in hand, Marquis. Purge these wicked thoughts of yours on paper; maybe they'll govern you less in life.
Don't be so sure.
I'm not a beautiful young prospect, ripe for corruption.
You needn't worry, Valcour. It's administrative, nothing more.
Oh, Mr. Donowitz -
Thanks.
You could have told me you were fiance number three.
Then come for dinner.
Order out like a Philistine, when you got the Galloping Gourmet here?...
Best seat in the house -- Hey, Mick, this is too much.
Liza?
Is that what they told you?
Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch. Ay, a scratch, a scratch. HA HA HA.
Twelve.
Well, the freighter. The twine. The blood. The knife. The cup. The watch. The second battery. The phantom lantern. The fishing gaff. The cracked gunnel. The skull wound. The blond hair. That's eleven things...
And since you confess this is all pure guesswork. What is your expertise, sir, are you a detective of sorts?
My expertise. Is that I'm a journalist.
But isn't the truth that there are several other ways to explain each of these twelve pieces.
Courage man, the hurt can not be much.
You share a place with T-Bone?
Is that why you came to Chicago in the first place? Because of, you know, dividing up your record collection and stuff?
Awhile back, Dick and Barry and I agreed that what really matters is what you like, not what you are like...
I understand completely.
What do you mean, the Crumblers? You know the Crumblers? Nobody's heard the Crumblers. Except me.
Look at Foley! Can you believe it!
Shhhh...
You take off when you have to.
I want you to go on this trip.
I can't do this alone. I'm afraid he'll pull the stiff one eye on me. I need you to chaperon. Separate everything but cars. You said you liked convertibles. Now I'm on the hook.
Bettes tells me he's doing fine.
Well... twenty-four more hours to go and tonight we'll share with our friends and loved ones the joys of those last moments of singleness.
Wouldn't think of it. Because tomorrow... We're going to the chapel and we're...
Uh. I saw that moving...
Mississippi?
And a little ice.
I honestly wish I could...
You mean, you're a thief?
The... bullets?
How about Bruce's?
Well, I can't really blame you -- not now.
But I do believe it -- that's what I don't believe. So it's goodbye Alexander Dyle -- Welcome home Peter Joshua.
Adam Canfield. Wonderful. Do you realize you've had three names in the past two days? I don't even know who I'm talking to any more.
The man's the same, even if the name isn't.
No -- he's not the same. Alexander Dyle was interested in clearing up his brother's death. Adam Canfield is a crook. And with all the advantages you've got -- brains, charm, education, a handsome face --
Yeah.
This is not giving blood. This is drunk.
Why?
He doesn't like me. What you eatin'?
Sure a lot of guys lookin' for Lednov.
Yeah -- and Lednov's only lookin' for one man. Me.
Unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.
That's Lednov! We come along here.
And meet him there.
I wish I didn't have to do this, Terry.
Wow... .
Four thirty-seven that isn't where Gerry G...?
Charley... . Charley... . Wow... .
I could have been better!
I tell you, Charley, I haven't made up my mind!
Make up your mind, kid, I beg you, before we get to four thirty-seven River... .
Long wait for a bus?
How long you been waiting?
He ain't that way. He's got heart.
Who?
She said what you said she'd say.
His apartment?
Y'call that art? Why, my three-year-old can paint better than that.
Like you'd know. You started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle.
Judy, I want to tell you: these few days have been the first happy days I've had in a year.
You can.
How did you get this job?
You can't testify.
Why not?
They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them. They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all.
Yeah, well, that's enough.
Peter, I believe in you. More to the point, I read your new script... um...
"Ashes To Ashes?"
That's the one, "Ashes To Ashes." I think it's great. But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen.
So, it is a blacklist.
Don't say that. There is no such thing as a blacklist. Now, are you gonna play ball?
Which you have in mind.
It's all right -- I don't think Tex does, either.
Tex? You mean he's here, too?
Look.
I know, but this is all we've got left.
Well, you're right there. Ten minutes ago I had a job.
Stop grousing. If we find the money I'll buy you an international conference all your own. Now start looking. You take this side and I'll poke around over there.
It's hopeless -- I don't even know what we're looking for.
Look at this!
I don't know. Doesn't look like anybody got hurt in this one.
What's wrong?
Nothing. Buckle up, okay?
I'm fine. You rest.
I feel like driving.
What the fuck!
I'll pay for it.
What the fuck!
You said it looked like a car accident.
Quit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley.
You're different.
Vivian, what the --
I am on the level. If I knew anything I'd....
And if I could describe it, it probably wouldn't be on a radio show. But what the hell. It's not one specific thing. It's more of a feeling.
Alfredo, go fuck yourself!!!
Then why don't you change jobs?
Because I'm an idiot. How many other guys in town know how to be a projectionist? None! Only a jerk like me could do it. Besides I wasn't lucky. When I was a kid there was the war! When I grew up, another war! Now it's all different. Times have changed. And you want to be a dope like me? Huh? Answer me!
So I'll call you tomorrow.
I don't think that'll be necessary. Let's all have a seat. Boris, why don't you be nice and get coffee for everybody.
All right, I'll see you!
You got an elevator in this house?
Then I'll fire you. I'll do all the parts myself.
Don't accept any more.
Collect?
Throw it in the basket. What's it say? "Have I got a story! It's getting hotter and hotter. Hope you're the same."
Yearbooks always set you out for disappointment, I want mine to say: Nick probably won't amount to much, so don't be surprised if you never hear anything about him again. Can we go?...It smells like someone left their gym bag in here.
Well stay for tonight, then.
You don't have to go this second. You can stay until whenever.
The case..with the stones... Where is it?
I don't wanna go.
Yes. Of course..
Leeloo..
What're you laughing about?
Learning our history! The last 5000 years that she missed! She's been out of circulation a while, you know.
It was the husband. The police finally got a hold of the witness at work and showed him a picture of the woman.
Nothing up there... The grass is matted down in a few places, but that could have been anything.
The police think he was high on drugs...
Then you remember more than I do.
Finally, I'd like you to join the drama club. Rehearsals are Tuesday and Thursday evenings.
I'd work backstage or something?
For the inner satisfaction it will bring. Saturday mornings, I'd like you to tutor disadvantaged students at our sister school --
I'm as underprivileged as they are --
You don't. That's the point.
Landon, none of us faculty see you the way you see yourself. Some of us remember how your father --
Or something. They're doing a play for the holidays.
When do I get time for me?
You are weird. Let's just go.
Oh, geez.
Waddaya mean, Ralph?
There's nobody else on the paper who can write! This'll break me, unless -- Hildy!
Sweeney.
Sweeney! You can't do that to me! Not today, of all days! Jumping Jehosophat! Oh, no, Sweeney... Well, I suppose so... All right. If you have to, you have to. How do you like that? Everything happens to me -- with 365 days in the year -- this has to be the day.
I don't care whether he did or not. He's supposed to be covering the Earl Williams case and there he is -- waiting at the hospital! Is there no sense of honor left in this country?
Not yet. Might just as well be. The only man on the paper who can write -- and his wife picks this morning to have a baby!
I'm gonna call the police then, sir.
Yeah, but I didn't do anything.
Your hand is bleeding.
Why? ...what?
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
I know.
Sir, I have no way of proving that you demolished the bathroom --
Why?
Alright, well you're gonna have to leave. You're gonna have to go.
I didn't do it.
Yeah, but how are they making the salmon? Poached with a yogurt-dill sauce? Teriyaki? Curry?
Just a few more minutes. It'll take them a while to get the boats organized...
Where?!
None of this stuff was here in 1962. The Valley was mostly small homes and fruit orchards.
Yeah. Maybe he'll call.
Do you know how I define "idealism," Monsieur Delben ?
Stay on the other side of the pond for a couple of months--you'll soon forget all about it.
Three thousand for five days. And Vivian, I will let you go.
Did I wake you?
I'm up.
I had to call. I jus got off the phone with James Kross. Get this. He wants to see you. Today.
Why?
He wouldn't say. Edward... I think we got him. His nuts are on the block and we got him. You there?
Give me twenty minutes.
I believe he believes him.
Right. Something black though.
I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed.
It wasn't no fun, Lula. The wind was blowin' super-hard and I wasn't dressed warm. Only instead of freezin', I was sweatin' strong.
We didn't do nothin' special I can remember. Just talked, is all.
I do.
No, I like gettin' up around four a.m. and talkin' bout wild animals... Though you woke me up this time in the middle of a dream. I kinda wish I didn't remember it. Up at Pee Dee, I couldn't remember any of my dreams.
Too bad they don't give an award for talkin'... You'd win first prize. Especially with those tits.
This is crazy -- you're not going to eat dinner with us.
I hear they're closing that post down.
You mean don t go at all? What about my internship?
What?
For us, Kate.
...Not yet.
Yeah?
It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing. I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long.
Exactly. Here we go again.
I don't think so. No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're...
No, I didn't.
Nothing.
Bill, I am eating dinner with you. And your family. And that's what we're doing. It's not open for discussion. Nothing is. Don't you understand?
Yearse!
But this is my car.
And you get into any car you want and just drive off?
Thank you. But when you take these cars don't you think you are wronging the owners?
We have a murder?
You thought any more about our murder?
You lived in the man's house what-- seventeen, eighteen years? And you didn't get to know him any better than that?
I think somewhere between Roderick Bledsoe's club and his house, Wade ran into Buddy Deeds. I think Buddy put a bullet in him, waited for him to die, threw him in the trunk of the Sheriff's car and drove him out by the Army post, I think he buried him under four feet of sand and never looked back.
Do you?
I got an idea what happened.
Yes, sure.
That actually goes on...
No, I really got this job on a fluke and wait till you hear where it ends up.
Except I'm no good at what I'm being a success at.
If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
That's me, Sir.
It hadn't occurred to me until then. I was just having such a wonderful time -- Besides, isn't this what I'm here for?
I wish you had said something to me about staying here --
No.
Are you ready Ilsa?
Here it is.
I understand.
She tried everything to get them, and nothing worked. She did her best to convince me that she was still in love with me, but that was all over long ago. For your sake, she pretended it wasn't, and I let her pretend.
Elliot what?
OK, call 'im up and arrange a meeting, so we can get through all the getting to know you stuff.
Elliot Blitzer.
He's nothing. He's in my acting class. But he works as an assistant to a very powerful movie producer named Lee Donowitz. I thought Donowitz could be interested in a deal like this. He could use it. He could afford it.
Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
Hardly anything. I wasn't sure from your letter what was bullshit, and what wasn't.
I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier cheats. He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there. But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger. He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
Only a very little, as soldiers do.
The captain was the nephew and heir of the Minister of Police, Herr Galgenstein, a relationship which, no doubt, aided in the younger gentlemen's promotion.
How do you do, sir?
What is the service, sir?
Your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well -- and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.
There is lately come to Berlin a gentleman in the service of the Empress Queen, who calls himself the Chevalier de Belle Fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the Spur. He is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.
You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well?
I'm beginning to think you two deserve to be locked up.
What, are you kidding? See that book? I've been trying to get through that book ever since I first got here. I haven't finished the first chapter. Did you read all them books?
Yeah, I went out for a couple of hours.
Thanks.
Museums... art galleries... concerts.
Well, I believe you when you say you go to school.
I like that. "Suspension of Disbelief."
What's your new book about?
How's that?
Hopeless. It's hopeless.
Leave me alone, dammit! You people are crazy! I've got to get away from here! I've got to do something!
Control!?! What control!?! Get away from me!
Well yeah, I didn't know much about him. I just thought --
Wait, hold on, Mary -- it's not as bad as it sounds. I certainly didn't know --
Harry, son. Harry.
Excuse me... what's your, um, your name?
And... what's my name again?
Nobody's a nobody. Why're you crying? What's wrong?
Exactly.
Give me a break. Remember Manzini? When he stole Montezuma's scepter he left a Pepto Bismal bottle. The best ones always copy Mac.
I've got thirty-five minutes to climb to fifteen thousand feet--that's the first mountain pass.
At what altitude?
And over the Himalayas. That's called flying over the hump.
"Burma run" because you fly over Burma...
Actually, I volunteered.
What lousy luck--I mean your orders... to draw an assignment like that!
Oh, I would love that, Wally.
Uh, look... if you're serious about wanting a job, picking apples isn't that boring.
I know...I know.
Now we're talking.
This is rose, right?
Good, yeah, it is a rose. Only this one is rather atypically made from 100 Pinot Noir.
Pinot noir? Not again! You know, not all Pinots are noir.
You all right? What's the matter?
Alvy Singer. It was nice nice... Thanks very much... for everything.
Gimme a break, will yuh, gimme a break. Jesus Christ!
I need a large polo mallet!
I have to give this baby to some- body.
Miss Vivian... things that go on in other hotels don't happen at the Regent Beverly Wilshire.
Heart, but I ain't got no Tocker.
Take to look out there ..- Have you seen what he's done? You're talking about a crazy animal!
How could she not be real? I can smell her, taste her. She does exactly what she did... it's not possible.
That's right. Not only that, but he gave his school money to his brother Harry, and sent him to college. Harry became a football star made second team All American.
Uh-huh. Breakfast is served; lunch is served; dinner . . .
Peanut?
What about me?
Welcome to Charenton, Abbe du Maupas.
You'd deny a dying man his salvation?
I must grant him his last rites.
We've traveled a long way. We're looking for Fin Raziel.
Take you, for instance...
I doubt the faeries will admire their beauty... Come, this will be fun to watch.
A fine mess this is... horrid, nipping creatures... What do we now, Jack?
It's ok.I know what you were feeling.
Great.
Yeah, OK. I found the first Licorice Comfits album at Vintage Vinyl. The one on Testament of Youth. Never released here. Japanese import only.
Good weekend?
Oh, hi. Hi, Rob.
'Morning, Dick.
You remember that far back? Boy, I can't even remember yesterday.
I came here before.
I had to go to a head-shrinker. I only went twice though. My mother said it cost too much, so she went to Hawaii instead.
When I was here? When I ran away. I used to run away a lot but they always took me back.
I m not trying to knock the tire business, Jack.
Well... where can we go?
Goodnight, son. 'Night, Delly.
When will you wake up? You Wouldn't know a normal life if it Bit you in the ass.
City hall?
Why me?
I'm sure you'll be very convincing.
I'm -- I'm sorry.
Here's ten.
Please keep it.
You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur F lix -- are they for sale now?
And the last one?
Do you have anything to eat? And the orange one -- what about the orange one?
Yes, you certainly will. And you'll find a nice girl and rebuild America. Just the way it used to be.
I believe there will be other survivors. In fact, I'm guessing there's life on the surface, even now. It's not life worth living perhaps, but believe me, something's moving around up there. And I don't just mean the cockroaches.
You know, every day for three years I asked myself that same question?
How did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?
I can hear myself starting out. "Your Honor -- I have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper --" He'd throw the New York State Penal Code right in my face. -- And it's six volumes.
Give him evidence.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.
Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
One thing I don't need is heckling! You called and asked me for help -- and now you're acting like a taxpayer!
What do you need before you can search -- bloody footsteps leading up to the door?
A detective's nightmare.
By morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.
How did you get in here? You're under age.
Yes?
I think Glenn opened his big mouth and now we got us another partner.
Whatta you think?
Or two.
Yeah? She said that to you?
You're a really good kisser.
Come on...
Listen. I feel pretty strange here. Because Mark really likes you, and he's my friend.
I don't know. It's getting pretty late...
Yeah. Yeah. It bothers me a lot. 'Cause, you see, twice, Sarah -- once at Ames with Minnesota Fats and then again at Arthur's... ...in that cheap, crummy poolroom... Now, why'd I do it, Sarah? Why'd I do it? I coulda beat that guy, I coulda beat him cold. He never woulda known. But I just had to show 'em, I just had to show those creeps and those punks what the game is like when it's great, when it's really great. You know, like anything can be great -- anything can be great... I don't care, bricklaying can be great. If a guy knows. If he knows what he's doing and why, and if he can make it come off. I mean, when I'm goin' -- when I'm really goin' -- I feel like... ...like a jockey must feel. He's sittin' on his horse, he's got all that speed and that power underneath him, he's comin' into the stretch, the pressure's on him -- and he knows -- just feels -- when to let it go, and how much. 'Cause he's got everything workin' for him -- timing, touch. It's a great feeling, boy, it's a real great feeling when you're right, and you know you're right. It's like all of a sudden I got oil in my arm. Pool cue's part of me. You know, it's a -- pool cue's got nerves in it. It's a piece of wood -- it's got nerves in it. You feel the roll of those balls. You don't have to look. You just know. Ya make shots that nobody's ever made before. And you play that game the way nobody's ever played it before.
You know, someday, Sarah, you're gonna settle down. You're gonna marry a college professor, and you're gonna write a great book. Maybe about me, huh? Fast Eddie Felson, hustler.
You need the words?
You glad?
Hello, Eddie.
As Balzac said...
No.
No?
Hey pal, I got a mortgage, all right? I got two kids. I got a wife. Besides, he made the deal. There's no shame in it.
What was it like?
Did you give her a jump? If you did I might begin to understand where your head's at.
That how you see it?
A gust of wind killed him.
Hey, you weren't there. Right?
Yeah, and what put him up there?
Ah, well... okay. Good! I just wondered...
Nothing that a few mega-vitamins couldn't cure.
Again?
Did I give it to you?
Are you working?
You're heading up the division in charge of babies for Mr. and Mrs. Simon Kurtz.
Women and the space program have come a long way, sweetheart. But after the wedding, no more complicated computers for my little girl.
Who would believe that Elaine Thompson was once a stewardess on the Denver-Chicago run.
For the best little computer officer on the Mercury mission.
Why not?
Nothing, 'til I find out if it's the gun Julia Wolf was killed with. Keep her in here, and don't let those reporters see her. They might believe her.
She brought it in. Trying to make me believe she did it.
Time's getting short.
I've told you a hundred times not to speak to me with a cigarette in your mouth.
I want to speak --
Not now.
Again?
Have you a minute now?
No -- I told you not to come in this lobby.
Hello!
Yes, sir.
Well, it was just an idea -- I hate to see a ticket go to waste --
This date -- is it just a date -- or is it something serious?
Well, in that case, couldn't you -- ?
On V-J Day he wept and prayed again.
Yes, sir.
Well, it bothered me somewhat. And I got quiet. And now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. And I decide I'm not going to propose. The mood is not right. Why be impulsive? Now at this point I know she knows that I was going to propose and didn't. And she knows I know. So the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. And we're both good at that. We fly to Honolulu in silence. We check into the Pro Bowl hotel --
Yes. Yours got the larger Nielson share.
But I've never forgotten you, Elena!
Also, um zwoelf Uhr.
Not merely as it was a hundred years ago. As it was a year ago, or six months ago, whenever you were here to see it. Madeleine, think of when you were here!
I had some players to see and hands to shake.
And it's a all real.
Where are you going?
We're heading back to Cape Kenneth.
Don't get too excited, Fuzzy.
Has anyone offered you anything to eat?
Actually, someone did. I just didn't think I could eat anything.
I wonder if you might give me a ride.
Sure! Be glad to! Uh... a ride where?
Hey, you asshole! I want you to arrest me!
Queen Elizabeth is a man! Prince Charles is a faggot! Winston Churchill was full of shit!
What?
I swear, I don't know this girl.
Shakespeare was French! The Queen Mother sucks cocks in hell! Shit! Fuck! Piss!
Are you kidding?! That heap of junk will never leave the ground!
Listen--
Excuse me--but--You know where I can find--I mean I don't remember his last name--
I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.
This is something I should have done a long time ago, only I didn't have sense enough to do it. No, I had to stick around here to try and make a success of something that I knew darn well was a failure from the very beginning. But no more. No more! So that's that.
and if it's all the same to you, I'm moving out.
O-o-oh, I get you All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
I . . .
No dog.
Very nice.
What about Neil?
Yeah.
No dog.
What's to like?
Reggie -- you haven't spoken a word in twenty minutes.
Are you sure there's no mistake?
None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
Nothing's going to happen to you while I'm around -- I want you to believe that.
How can I believe it when you don't even know who the killer is? I've got that right, haven't I? You don't know who did it.
STAY OUT OF IT. STAY OUT OF IT, MAVERICK.
COME OFF--COME OFF RIGHT. I'M ON MY WAY IN. YOU GO FREE, I'M ENGAGING.
IT'S MY SHOT.
YOU GOT TOO MUCH NOSE TO TAIL -- I'M COMING IN.
GET LOST!
FIRE, OR CLEAR OUT, ICE.
GET OUT OF THERE, YOU'RE UNSAFE. GET OUT OF THERE.
STAY WHERE YOU ARE. HE'S MINE. I'M ENGAGED. I'M IN.
ICE, ROLL OFF, I CAN SHOOT HIM.
YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN. I'M IN.
And your evaluation of the defendant? Could he kill a much larger man with a fishing gaff? So quickly, there would be no sign of struggle?
Sorry. My life isn't that interesting. I go to work. I go home. I don't know what to say.
I don't know.
Yeah, I don't know. It's hard to know.
Yeah, I guess.
Harmless!
How long you have this detail?
Alors?
I don t have your credentials, Nathalie.
This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
What, again?
-- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
Well, I'll get it from the safe.
Uh, well ... we flipped a coin.
Better take care of your fingers, little brother. Buy yourself a case of arthritis and you won't be able to play 'Chopsticks.'
I stick my neck out for nobody.
A wise foreign policy.
You remember this room?
Foolish? If this dress were to walk down the boulevard all by itself I would follow it from one end of Paris to the other, and when I caught up with it I would say, "Just a moment, you charming little dress, I want you to meet Ninotchka... you two were meant for each other." Ninotchka feels more comfortable.
A goodly length in times past, but lately
Oona... don't cry... please, you mustn't...
Too bad your precious Jack can't hear you... the damsel in distress... A rescue attempt would be most amusing... We could flay sweet Jack alive as an after-dinner entertainment...
When the time's come, you won't need to jump, I'll throw you out myself!
No. Now is the time for discipline. Some lessons in obedience for the future Baroness.
Please...
Ah! HOLLY Now.
And the quail is responsible for the quail eggs.
I know. You're an actress with a great flair for shrimp puffs.
Oh no. Not at all.
Yeah, I made some money down there, then I talked my way into another college and I did it. I wasn't magna cum laude but I did okay. You should've seen me in my cap and gown.
Why the fuck didn't you invite me? I would've come.
Ay, palequero. Never hochi in the P.I.
Wha-chu-say, palequero? Short time, long time, only ten dolla.
Don't try me, Johnny!
Marylin Rexroth? When does she --
Please! No calls! I'm feeling very fragile.
Herb wants to see me?
Just his style, Morg. Doesn't Mean anything.
You prefer a book to your husband's company?
Doesn't that please you?
How do you do?
And you call me a moron...
You'll never get the chance.
No. But I'll kill your fucking girlfriend!
Or else what? You'll kill me?
Saint Severin? The church? So you know all about the ADM! Where is it! Tell me! Tell me or else!
What, you think Claude hangs out underground cause he likes to dance?
Bullshit! You're bluffing!
Don't be an idiot! I'm not the only one. If I die, Serafine dies!
Nothing comes.
No reason. Just a hunch. But I'm going to find out. I'm tired of being pushed around.
Is that Snoopy? In the purple doo rag?
What's he do now, tell fortunes?
What's wrong.
I'm just temporarily off my game.
It's with me all the time, Claire, I just don't like to talk about it.
And what a maiden, pure as the Driven snow, I'm sure.
Yeah?
What was that all about?
I don't know...
What? Hana comes in, sleepily, frowns at the gramophone.
I don't care to bargain. It's full of saffron, just in case you think I'm giving it to you to encourage your sewing.
Of course. You didn't need to slap my face to make me feel as if you'd slapped my face.
Yes. Yes. Absolutely.
Thought you'd never wake up!
I am not a doctor.
You know everything I know, plus what you've taught yourself--you're a better doctor then I am and you know it!
Don't this place look like home?
I made Sir William Cosgrove's acquaintance as usual at the play- table. One could not but admire the spirit and gallantry with which he pursued his favorite pastime; for, though worn out with gout and a myriad of diseases, a cripple wheeled about in a chair, and suffering pangs of agony, yet you would see him every morning, and every evening at his post behind the delightful green cloth.
Right...she married...what was he?
He buys and sells the world.
What are you on?
Pardon me?
I'm good, thanks.
How's your wife?
When we divorce a decade ago, she was very, very angry. Now she's just hostile.
how much weight have you lost?
Oh...nothing. Thirty pounds. I just haven't been very hungry.
See you.
I bring you the only treasure worthy of your loveliness... for naught else in the universe rivals the reflected glory of your beauty.
They call me Green Jack, ma'am.
Your fair smile be thanks enough. Better I stand afar to admire your beauty complete.
The moon herself would hide behind a cloud rather than dare comparison with you...
Hello, Mary. I just happened to be passing by.
Let's go out in the fields and take off our shoes and walk through the grass.
So am I. I want to see you again. I want to see you as much as I can before you leave. I said it.
I'll take my chances.
I've adjusted, and thanks for asking.
Needs salt.
On it! I'm in it ... They think I did it!
This gun yours?
Who's is it?
I'll have to try to remember.
Okay. There's plenty of time. I guess we got to ask you a lot more questions than we counted on. We'll come up tomorrow when you're feeling better. Come on.
He'll be here. Give him time to get his trousers on. Where's Asta? Asta! Asta!
You're a fine watch dog.
Job? Being a great date.
But personal services are not the kind of thing I usually get into.
Thank you.
It's good you want to do something, George.
After a while that hurts... doesn't it?
How am I gonna do that?
Oh, that mob downstairs. I guess I got so interested in the play I forgot all about them.
Where'd you get that dress?
We're a tiny version of all that?
I hear that! See, I knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but I wanted to try -- I thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. My son would grow up here. Maybe have one or two more. I'd teach 'em what I could. They'd play with my brother's kids. All grow up together. And even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was -- cause we'd keep it for 'em...
And the blood could not have belonged to defendant. Seeing that his type is O negative.
Well, I'll come in for a minute, but I didn't tell anybody I was coming over here.
It's four in the morning... I'm going to go to sleep.
Isn't true. I can't see a damn thing.
Well, if all you care about is basketball, why you fucking me? Go fuck Dick Vitale.
Ahh, Vada, just put anything you want in the cart, anything at all. I don't know what's gotten into her today.
Tuesday.
What day is it?
I'll be right there.
I don't know -- it depends on whether or not they've already eaten.
Lord, I forgot all about it -- Sylvie works late Tuesday nights -- she always leaves him with me. They wouldn't do anything to a little boy, would they?
So the blood on the gaff was not fish blood at all. It was human, yes? Type B positive.
We gotta face some facts here.
We had a deal!
You don't wanna put beer over mai-tai.
Waitress! Four beers!
Yeah, right. Anyway, you didn't know.
I understand how it could happen. I know why any guy would love her. And I can't blame you that it happened. You thought I was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.
Yes, you are free to go, Karel here will drive you home.
I'm saying now you do know. So it's time for you to fuck off.
Then we run our hands down a man's arms and legs-- like this--in case they got what you're looking for attached to a string. See what I mean, Purser?
What s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
Yeah.
Oh... I'm fired?
Fine.
Fine?
It's a very good year.
They should be. They're both good at it.
Try a strawberry.
Bert, I believe Mr. Felson's making a proposition.
Swell!
She needs to be changed.
How much?
Well, I win sometimes.
He was this fashion guy, and there were all these Japanese fashion people- it's a whole other world, and I was talking to these Japanese surfers... He was playing all this great music- I have to find out what it was...
Any idea where it is?
What about it?
Well, that's interesting. Wh-what kind of stuff?
Merry Christmas.
Yeah?
Eighty proof. What d'ya say? Think you can handle it?
I don't know when. We'll see what...
I don't know.
For the very first time in my life. Do you know what that's like?
You're really in love, aren't you?
Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be living in the lobby.
You scraped the dried blood from the butt of the gaff. Where a fella's hand goes. And what did you see under your microscope, besides the B positive blood and the wood scrapings...?
There seem to be lots of reasons why I shouldn't.
Tch, oh. I always told you you would leave me. But...does it have to be now?
Why?
What are you going to use for money?!
Are you asking me out?
That long neck -- the line of you... you're porcelain... your back goes on forever. You're classic... you're why cavemen chiseled on walls...
But you're beautiful... your skin glows.
What do you think?
About one to five years worth.
Maybe six months with good behavior. One to five.
Don't ask for it, Ninotchka. There is a Turkish proverb which says, "If something smells bad, why put your nose in it?"
With our cream situation what it is, it is Russia which should apologize to the cats.
Imagine, we don't have to whisper any longer.
We can say whatever we want. We can shout... we can complain... Look... The service in this hotel is terrible! See? Nobody comes... nobody pays any attention. That's freedom.
No, that's bad management.
...and Kopalski.
Ernie.
Christmas? It can t be Christmas...
That s totally see through...
How are you, Rhian?
That's it. I resign as of now.
Stop it.
Oh, terrific. Which way?
I'll tell you what. I'll stay if Tom knows how to spell Gaddafi.
That's it.
Everyone thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Elaine, what's going on?
The two of us were the only deputies back then me and Buddy--it's what-- '58--
The others?
What?
Stop acting like an infant. You're here because you want me to help you in some way. What do you need from me? You need money?
What the fuck!? You too!?
Oh, did I hurt the little girl's feelings? Well excusez moi... I confess my desire for ADM is quite "intense". So I deceived you and our poor friend Terry - a competent technician, but let's face it, a bit naive. "The great cure for lycanthropy!" Hmph. He didn't have the vision to grasp the potential of ADAM, until it was too late. And even then, he came rushing down to tell me, as if I would be just as shocked! Ha.
What?
You know what I mean -- the envelope with the stamps. I want it.
And the Sheriff at the time was Big Charley Wade. Charley was one of your old-fashioned bribe-or-bullets kind of Sheriffs, he took a healthy bite out of whatever moved through this county.
I'm not asking for us to be together.
I'm going through a lot of shit right now, more than you have time for.
I don't think so.
Look, I'm entering the draft.
I decided to go pro. And who knows where I'll end up, you know?
You expect me to pimp Madeleine?
I wasn't talking about Madeleine.
I could be convinced to abandon my writing, quite voluntarily.
You, Frank. All these years you been telling me we're different. We got novelty, Jack. No one can touch us.
Hyatt... Friedman s... at the Hyatt...
Yes and you don't have to be sarcastic about it, that's a beautiful thing he's doing -- some people do more than go to the beauty parlor and shop at Saks --
What are you doing with me, Rod?
Rod --
Tell him not to eat anything. We're gonna scarf when we get there.
Go on, go on, go on. And we'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.
Gee whiz, Boss, you know Mr. Norton told me not to leave him, not even for a minute.
Uh-huh. That's exactly what I thought. Beany, go on down to the office, tell Pop to give you the speech. There's a copy on my desk.
No, I never read the speeches before I make them. I get more of a kick out of it that way.
Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet. Say, tell me something did you read that speech you're gonna make tonight?
Hey, Boss.
I didn t deserve her back then.
Relatives of old man Semple.
Outside!
I beg your pardon, sir?
All right, outside!
There you are. You caught on. You see, you're nice and you're smart too. You caught on right away. Outside! Go on! Outside! And don't come back!
I think I understand, sir. You mean you want me to go?
That's a canary! Who brought that in here? Canary, huh? Go on, get that out of here. Get that out of here!
That's a canary, sir.
You know what? I don't take it back.
Because I'm in love with you.
I don't know, give me a minute. Are you all right with this?
I just walked in.
She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
I'm not tired.
You know, Anne does other people too. Sort of a sideline...
I didn't understand the spot I was putting Roderick in.
Could of been. That was white people's business.
Oh--I think he came in one more time with Hollis and--naw, your Daddy wasn't with them. Made their monthly pickup. Roderick wasn't in so I just kept my mouth good and shut and handed over that envelope.
He's been dead for three months.
I can think of nothing nicer. It's very kind of you to invite me--
...It's kind of a pro bono job.
Here.
If you could see your way to lending me some cash -
I'll share something with you.
You bet.
Thank you.
I'm sorry, I don't think so.
Yeah; just ten or fifteen dollars maybe.
I'm really sorry but I just arrived; I'm on a pretty tight budget myself. I just can't afford it.
And I made these!
Looks to me like standard equipment for the Department of Street Cleaning--
Too bad we're not making a trip around the world-- maybe we could finish this game. Hey! When you get through with that conference, shoot that last disk!
And who does Friedman work for?
Oh, Jesus.
We better get it into the box. Come on...
I've been investigating sightings for seventeen years, Mr. Shermin. This one's real. We have a dead extra- terrestrial in that tent and another one in the area that might be alive. We've been visited. It's finally happened and the sooner Washington accepts that and starts figuring out how we're going to deal with these beings, the better off we're going to be.
No, I'm not thinking clearly - I need a doctor too, to come with me, can I take this vehicle? I'll pay, of course - and some morphine and Seventy miles - I can be back here by dusk.
Could I trouble you for some water?
I desperately need a jeep. There's been an accident.
Do you know what you were kidnapped by?
Mrs. Haydn...
How did you do that, Mrs Spitz?
Is he on his way to Lathrop Wells?
What do you think has happened to your son, Mrs Spitz?
You didn't see it or speak to anybody?
Then it went well.
It's not that it's hard. I just want you to give me a minute to catch up.
What's-her-name moved to Buffalo.
Never mind. I'm tired. I'm going to take a nap.
I'm not hungry.
What's okay?
I'm sorry, Bill --
That's okay.
Then I can't help you.
You can make it as complicated or as easy as you like. But she's the one who's gonna be riding him, am I right? So here's the deal. I'm not sure I can do anything, but I'm prepared to give it a go -- -- if you'll help. You have a problem with that?
When I work with a horse, it's no good just me doing it. It doesn't work that way. The owner needs to be involved too.
Doesn't matter.
The Amish boy saw him, Paul. I'll make it, but Set Donahue and the Homicide Department off my back or they'll blow the whole thing.
The whole kit and caboodle of 'em are British Intelligence agents. Spies. Jerry Garcia had a double- o rating. Just like James Bond.
Flesh wound. No big deal.
Fine, thanks, Sheriff.
Oh, that'll be all right, Hildy. Go ahead, run it. And you can say I treated him well, too. 'Lo, Earl. How are you feeling?
Now, wait a minute! I'm not afraid of anything. What were you going to write about Williams?
I gave strict orders that nobody was to interview Williams without my permission.
I never could believe that Tom was a split personality. I never believed he was a Dumper; and I don't believe he disappeared of his own volition; and I don't believe he's alive.
I don't believe Tom's alive.
But what reason could he have? What possible reason?
I knew Tom never wrote that letter.
When I'm surrounded, with my back against the wall, you're not going to lay down on me, are you --
I said we're leavin'.
What are you snickering about?
I'm not snickering. I'm smiling. Because I'm happy.
What?
What do you mean, "what?"
Fuck off.
Uh, yes I, like, do... It's simple. You make the tracks -- recording studio -- deliver them to the pressing plant where a master is cut, the master is then dubbed to submasters, which are the "mothers," as their called, for each press in the plant. You press the CD's or records, put in your cover art, and that's it.
Pick you up Friday, then
Fifty, and you've got your man.
Take it or leave it. This isn't a negotiation.
There's a way to get a guy's attention.
I mean Wo-man. How ya doin'?
Yeah, intensive care ward. My God-hey, Max, I think she's... I think she's giving me the eye.
I can beat him, Bert. Now he suckered me 'cause he knows how to hustle. I didn't think he did. But I can outplay him. I can beat him.
Real good.
How am I doin'?
The sun will heat that thing to over 450 degrees within seconds. He'll roast like a pig on a spit.
Are you afraid?
That's right -- premature ejection.
Sit down, Elaine. If this bomb trick works we just might make it. Simon was a fool to eject now.
I guess you'd have to be a fool not to be afraid at a time like this.
Remember when I told you my Dad was in Hell?
You know what they say. You have the same chance of winning whether you play or not.
Lemme guess. The lottery.
Did she make any sound? Didn't scream?
And if that's not destiny, I don't know what is.
You think so?
Y'know, d'ya think you an' my sister -- Ah, doin' good together?
Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
My dear Mademoiselle, perhaps you have already observed that in Casablanca, human life is cheap. Good night, Mademoiselle.
Uh huh. Under a safe conduct from me.
That is also true, except for one destination, to return to occupied France.
No... no, thanks. A bit early in the day for spirits. Well, I guess that about covers everything, doesn't it? I never married; I don't see much of the "old college gang"; I'm a retired detective -- and you're in the shipbuilding business. What's on your mind, Gavin?
'Bout an hour ago.
When was they here?
That's what I'm sensing.
I see "elegant."
I'm sorry. But if the shoe fits.
It means that your taste in men's apparel is as bad as your taste in men.
You're serious, aren't you?
I'll go back to them.
'Night, Marie.
Okay, we don't take this emotionally. We roll with this problem.
Do you know my first name?
No, you weren't. Don't you realize the only time I was really happy in the last five years was when I was playing ball with those guys?
What was I gonna say?
Ya, somethin' like that.
Eh? Si! Avanti!
Were you alone?
Of the woman in the mirror. Would you know her if you saw her?
Naah, I don't wanna.
So you're monumentally busy?
Look Diane, I'm sorry, but I can't allow you to leave the country without going to Valhere's graduation party. This gentleman, he's twenty-two, and he comes out of hiding once a year for this occasion, and he dresses up as the Lakeside rooster, and he,
This here's Carolyn. Honey, this is my son, Delmore.
If I thought it would help I'd put up a sign telling them not to. Right under the one about the employees washing their hands.
Deal drugs in the bathroom--
You get much of that in here?
That's where he fell.
That where he was shot?
Hobby of mine. Got some artifacts, couple pieces one of your men out at the base made. Free admission.
Nice to meet you, Ma'am.
Jesus...
Any chance of getting me out on bail?
Sure, they wanted to know if I ever voted Conservative.
They didn't look like medical files to me.
Regards to Her Majesty.
It's libelous; you wouldn't dare.
I don't really remember that.
It's such a great song.
Don't tell me you don't know how all this works?
Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work!
Later, David! Later! There's not a minute to lose!
You Yanks and your therapy. It s great. It s all a bit too touchy-feely for me.
Hey, Kat.
Crikey.
What?
Nothing, nothing.
No, tell me.
Watch it!
Look, no way I'm lettin' you out there. In a half hour you could be in Canada.
She's a bird, Willow.
She can't be wrong. She's a very very very powerful sorceress.
Just smile again and be reasonable. I'll order dinner here--just the two of us--like old times.
Let's see if I can bring it back to life.
What makes you so disgustingly cheerful this morning?
I'd have gotten you some cream but it meant buying a whole pint.
Egg. One egg doughnuts black coffee. That's your ration till lunch. Any complaints?
I know a couple of truck drivers I'd like to have you meet sometime. Come on, sit down.
I thought maybe uh "believe you me" told you a couple of snappy stories.
That is perverse. Do not tell anyone you don't own fucking Blonde on Blonde. What about Television?
NO--!
I will now sell four copies of Cats and Dogs by the Royal Trux.
All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
It s up to you whether they walk or not.
What about your friendly cop?
Yes ma..
Other than that... You all right?
I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
Oops! Mustn't say International. Dirty word. Filthy word. His Majesty! Die F hrer! Il Duce.
Okay. You want me to pick you up?
That's okay. We have to talk about it and we're not always in the same place ... so... I just have to get used to it. What do you want to do about dinner?
What sums?
Crash paranoia.
Runnin' off and worryin' people. Makin' it tougher on Clay than it is already.
Don't act so -- crazy.
That's a good girl.
So, did you buy a movie?
You bet!
How 'bout we check with Eve first?
Okay, Troy! Let's get those all-beef frozen patties!
No! There's an Adult Bookstore back there! I'll be right back!
I'm sorry. I took the Lord's name in vain again, didn't I? I'm so sorry.
A magazine? A toy perhaps? In the bookstore.
What?
Yeah. It was quite good actually. Some bits I really liked.
The sets were excellent. Everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. It was really clever.
But you re not interested in boutique dollars... I get it...
Ok.
No, we'll find something around here.
--And that Mr. Marsh paid less attention to you?
I'm always alone -- I have been everything.
Haven't you anyone -- Haven't you anybody -- you -- I mean -- Are you all alone in the world.
You must learn as quickly as your time allows -- Believe me Mr. Kringelein, a man who isn't with a woman is a dead man.
I had a very good opportunity, a young lady asked me to dance -- I ought to be able to dance, it seems to be very important.
Will you do me a big favor?
I was sent as a military surgeon to South Africa. Stinking climate. Taken prisoner. Home on parole not to fight. I was a surgeon in the Great War till the end. Grenade in the face. Carried diphtheria bacilli in the wound until 1920. Isolated two years. I've been everything.
Everything?
Would you like to make a man happy?
'Cause I'm worried, did you just break up with me?
Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis. This is "King of Blue"! This is the original recording. Hard to find in good condition. Where did you find this?
Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss.
Please.
Well, if we're friends, why can't we see each other?
I don't know, honey, but we gotta help that girl - get her to a town and hope no one catches on I broke parole.
One bad car accident...
I don't know... Looks like clothes.
They'll turn the ship into the wind before we launch. That'll help.
Let's get ahold a' her quick.
Riddle me this, Batman. If you're all so much in love with each other, what the fuck are you doing here? I'm sure you got better things to do with your time than walk around in circles starin' up a panther's ass. Your guy's interested because with that much shit at his fingertips he can play Joe fuckin' Hollywood till the wheels come off. He can sell it, he can snort it, he can play Santa Claus with it. At the price he's payin', he'll be everybody's best friend. And, you know, that's what we're talkin' about here. I'm not puttin' him down. Hey, let him run wild. Have a ball, it's his money. But, don't expect me to hang around forever waitin' for you guys to grow some guts.
Do I look like a beautiful blond with big tits and an ass that tastes like French vanilla ice-cream?
Hm?
No. No, you don't.
I'd draw my sword, and cut my way through them.
Yeah, could be. Or maybe she thought we'd have a lot to talk about.
Come on, you loved it. It was a new experience.
Oh, you weren't scared.
That wasn't very scary.
She took my head.
So?
I can't take any more school.
What? Another job? Stealing the Eiffel Tower?
Dude, it's gotta happen -- she's a college chick!
Well.
Sure. Shall I -- I mean shall I just stand here? I mean -- I don't know what you want me to do.
Yes?
Oh -- sure. Thank you.
Be off to your work, you pack of rascals, or you will have a good taste of my thong. Have you lost much?
What has happened, madam, to annoy your ladyship?
Show me a good "piggy-back" rider and I'll show you somebody that's human. Take Abraham Lincoln, for instance a natural "piggy-backer." Where do you get off with your stuffed-shirt family? Why, your father knew so much about "piggy-back" riding that he
This looks like the best spot.
I don't know about you, but I'm going to give a fairly good imitation of it.
What?
How are you, baby?
You are going to marry my brother?
What does a big old wooden house on the corner of Eddy and Gough Street have to do with her?
By whom?
All right, come on. Introduce me. Where is your hat?
Fate worse than death! Well, it's been real, boss, but I gotta go buff up my resum . ANYBODY HERE NEED A FIGMENT?
Hyp, I'll do anything.
Oh, right. Cheating Death. There's one thing you might try. Only one guy in history ever pulled it off. Well, actually two. Actually, no, there was that other guy who...well, very few people have done it.
Guys, I don't mean to be rude, but I only have eleven hours and fifty-three minutes to...
No, I'll settle for half that in cash.
Kid, listen: that's all I'm saying. And you didn't hear it from me.
Land of Death. How do I get there?
You know, people.
No rock. When she came to the bar, sans rock.
Single. Waitress. Getting off work. Looking for love. A little slap and tickle.
I'm trying to get you some action, but you've got to help me out just a little bit.
Didn't seem to me like that's what was going on. You were all over her.
Somebody had to do the talking. And by the way, I was right. She's not married.
How do you know?
The girl is looking to party, and you tell her we're going to go back to our motel room and crash? Jesus, Miles!
Well, I'm tired. Aren't you tired?
The chick digs you. She lit up like a pinball machine when she heard your novel was getting published.
Now I've got another lie to live down. Thanks, Jack.
Listen... I don't mean to be flippant or to enrage you or anything but... you're an imbecile. And I'm not The One... I'm not any One...
I know! You can't imagine how surprised I was. Who would think you could find anything divine on the Upper East Side.
The Holy Grail? Some billionaire has the Holy Grail sitting in a commode on Madison Avenue?
God... I'm the janitor of God.
I think we're O.K.
Oh, please... you're embarrassing me.
Can you read 'em Jack?
Kill me quickly.
No, no thanks. Hey, don't-
Uh, you're driving a-
Right! Where?
I, uh... well, you're not from New York, right?
Oh - you're an actress.
Jesus. You're supposed to take your make-up off before you apply the m...
Yeah. Got my own sign.
Comrades! Comrades! Don't let's give in so quickly. After all we have to uphold the prestige of Russia.
Rheya. Not here.
Oh. Huh. Well... Congratulations again, Vicki. That's wonderful news.
You quit drinking?
Yeah.
You have no idea what's happened to me.
Mary! Let me touch you! Oh, you're real!
Mary! Mary!
Give her to me. Catch up with us quickly.
I'm also good enough to go pro.
What? Who?
Cut round him for now.
Romeo.
I have to get back.
What do I do?
What?
Well, tell them to mind their damn business. You're smart enough to get a degree.
Uh-huh!
Precisely, my darling. Your animal strength, your primitive power has surfaced... you are what you desire.
And, now?
Mr. Carter, Merry Christmas.
No, they're for your mom.
Hi.
I didn't--
This is interesting-- Why didn't you tell me you gave this kid your gun last night?
Oh my God, sir!
Sir, my leg is on fire!
But, sir!
Thanks, buddy.
I'm happy for you, pal.
I have a watch.
Wrigley?
Well... I'm still...
Asian? No.
Is she Asian?
Kenneth this is my associate, Wrigley. Wrigley this is my friend, Dr. Beck.
Miles.
I don't like it.
We should get moving.
Right. No one else?
Paley could be a problem tomorrow.
It's only the beginning.
George is a hairdresser, isn't he?
Then maybe you can tell me why George would be going into the ladies room.
I don't think so.
Do you love him?
Well listen to me. Now, I know you like him, I know he's nothing like those frat kids you can't stand, but honey, after the excitement wears off, then what, huh? What are you going to talk about? What do you have in common? You're going to be part of an international think-tank, and he's going to be kicking punching bags.
It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
Diane, you owe it to yourself to get on that plane with no attachments, no strings, because after you get over there, things are going to change. People change.
Oh, tut, tut, tut.
Yeah -- I want to get this thing off and get moving.
Shit is a French word?
Helen-Thomas-Webber! Maybe we have been down here a little too long! Please excuse her French.
It's an archaic colloquialism, roughly meaning..."good".
Well, do we just go on up?!
Tired?
No, son! We wait for night. Now...is precisely when... we must be at our... most cautious.
Gosh! What do you know about that!
Really?
You have?
He sounds like a person worth while knowing.
You all right, Nolan?
Nice fellows.
You still call it ratting?
But you still hold out for silence?
Ain't you planning on going to bed in the near future?
You tell your sister about it?
Just hung up.
So what are you telling me, you're putting on two comics in a row?
No, it can't be, because he's a comic.
See that big car parked out by the fireplug on the way in? Well, that's mine. I like that car. But I get a new one every year because I make it my business to know what guys like you and Minnesota Fats are gonna do. I made enough off of you the other night to pay for it twice over.
In that case, you owe me another drink.
Maybe by that time you'll die of old age. How much do you think you'll, uh, need?
A thousand.
No, three thousand at least. He'll start you off at five hundred a game -- he'll beat the pants off you. That's the way he plays when he comes up against a man who knows the way the game is. He'll beat you flat four or five games -- maybe more, depending on how, uh... steady your nerves are. But he might -- he just might be a little scared of you, and that could change things. But I wouldn't count on it.
How do you know? Huh? When nobody knows that much?
You bet he knows how. You think that's a talent too, huh? Knowin' how to drink whisky? You think Minnesota Fats was born knowin' how to drink?
Okay, okay... What do I do now, lie down on the floor and, uh, bow from the ankles? What do I do, go home?
That's your problem.
So I stay. Stay until I hustle up enough to play Fats again. Maybe by that time I'll develop myself some character.
Alvy... Alvy Singer. I'm a comedian.
How was I to tell you? By writing a letter? WITH WHAT, MY ASININE BRIDE?
Morality.
Go to your reunion, Martin. See those people and discover what they mean to you. Try not to kill anybody for a few days, see how you feel.
It's a swell idea, Gallagher. How's this? The wife's family lawyer comes to see the kid, see - to talk over the divorce. Then this guy insults the poor but honest boy by offering him alimony - so the kid gets sore, socks the lawyer in the nose and throws him out. How's that for the beginning of the third act, huh?
No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
Nothing...That's McGown...that's Singer, isn't it? GOOSE Turn around, pay attention. What are you doing?
Who?
What are you doing?
'No comment' means 'yes.'
Hm? Tell me. What other treats?
Strip reality! How do you play that?
How do you play reality.
Who knew that when I started working in the finest foreign car shop in LA, I would also find the light of my life.
Come on...I'll show you where you're gonna stay.
What kind of games?
You'd done better to have told me that in the beginning. Where were you the afternoon she was knocked off?
No, it's not that. I ... can't drink from the bottle. I ... gag.
What do you do when you come here?
I made other plans. You can have both tickets.
Well, that's very kind of you -- only I'm not feeling well -- you see, I have this cold -- and I thought I'd go straight home.
Where are you going, Baxter?
Well, I don't want to intrude -- and I thought -- since it's all straightened out anyway --
I'm not through with you yet.
Yes, sir.
The reason I called is -- I won't be home for dinner tonight. The branch manager from Kansas City is in town -- I'm taking him to the theatre Music Man, what else? No, don't wait up for me -- 'bye, darling. Tell me something, Baxter -- have you seen Music Man?
Not yet. But I hear it's one swell show.
How would you like to go tonight?
You mean -- you and me? I thought you were taking the branch manager from Kansas City --
Sure.
What are you doing on the wall?
Just call us the quot;dead end kids quot;.
What for?
That's O.K.
He was caressing.
No..I have to get back to work. Take care of yourself.
I'm not with your party -- I'm sorry.
No -- actually I'm just looking for a friend.
Yes, but I'm afraid --
Oh, that's a relief.
Tell me. I won't think you're insane.
She was real. Where did she come from?
Who was it?
How long can you go without sleep?
How much sleep?
How much sleep do you need?
Well, when you do go to sleep: barricade your door.
That depends.
No word at all?
Well, that's a hot one. You a bookkeeper! When were you ever a bookkeeper?
I'll call you up tomorrow morning. Maybe, we'll go see a movie.
Waddaya doing tomorrow night?
The reason I can't be definite about it now is my Aunt Catherine is probably coming over tomorrow, and I may have to help out.
Don't drown.
You remember the man who walked into the Bank of Constantinople and walked out with the Bank of Constantinople?
Smells like a battle.
You all right?
These burns. My arms. Ouch...
What kind of "stuff?"
Oh... Sully.
Look, if it wasn't you who sent the letter, and it wasn't me who sent it?
Don't flatter yourself -- I was following her, I always do. How the hell you think I got rid of Mary's boyfriend Steve?
Like I'm going to try to figure out a guy who's idea of courting is blowing farts in the chick's face
I swear! I didn't tell her nothing! You probably did it yourself, you piece of shit.
Oh that makes a lot of sense. Why would I rat myself out?
You don't think--?
A man, my lord?
Not me. Thought I'd head out west ... get into some Redwood country.
Haven't seen her - not since we got back.
A bird in a gilded cage?
You're not going to use me as an excuse again, Mom. Every time you can't face yourself you want to move and you say it's because of me or the neighborhood or some other phony excuse. Now I want to do one thing right and I'm not letting you run away. Dad?
Son--this is all happening so fast--
No! You're not tearing me loose any more.
I don't want to learn that!
Just tell a little white lie?
You'll learn as you get a little older, Jim.
You better give me something, Dad. You better give me something Mom?
Well, if I couldn't be a good putterer, I wouldn't want to putter. But why? What makes you think I couldn't be a good putterer?
You're possessive.
You're the most adorable cog I ever saw in my life. Ninotchka, Cogitska, let me confess something. Never did I dream I could feel like this toward a sergeant.
Do you hear that?
It's midnight. One half of Paris is making love to the other half. Look at the clock. One hand has met the other hand. They kiss. Isn't that wonderful?
Was that talkative?
Lena I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that I left you at the hospital..... I called a phone sex line. I called a phone sex line before I met you and then these four blond brothers came after me and you got hurt and I'm sorry -- and I had to leave because I don't want you to get hurt again and now I'm here and I'm back and I have a lot of pudding that I can redeem in six to eight weeks and if you give me that much time I can get enough miles to fly with you wherever you have to go if you have to travel for your job because I don't want to be anywhere without you.....can you please let me redeem the mileage?
Where you been?
Well I had to go to Utah...but now I'm here and I'll be right back.
Ok.
If you give me six to eight weeks I can redeem the mileage and then I can with you wherever you have to travel......
I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Kinda like we're doin' right now -- uh oh!
Pretty tough for a valet, this fella.
But you can't say with any certainty that the blood was his.
Even though a D-6 is too big, and the flange had to be banged out to squeeze it in. Which makes it a peculiar choice. For a spare.
You said that. That was your testimony.
She's a good person to know. So where did you study again?
Alright, okay... I think you broke the record for staying in character about three hours ago.
Wow... You just gave me goosebumps, you know that? You make it all sound so real. Great improv...
Why would you be there?
Thanks.
Uh... Yeah. Yeah. She's real nice.
It feels wrong, Jack... like a trap.
Give in to despair and all is lost.
Aye, so long as you're not too greedy for the bait.
There's more than one way to spring a trap.
You've been inside?
Don't speak to me of dreams! I feel I've been dreaming since the unicorn was killed.
On the morrow I'll be awake enough to see if dreams come true.
That be so, better you pinch yourself now, Jack.
Morning.
Exactly the opposite.
If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
I had the worst goddamn nightmare.
How you doing this morning? Sleep OK? I didn't.
You're welcome..
Thanks for reminding me..
Miles! Don't waste time with someone else's queen, either.
I can't help it. Even with the business we're in, I -- it gets me every time. It's so -- optimistic.
My socks?
Oh, Jesus, please... Please, God.
...and put them in your mouth.
That's right.
Stupid is trying to sell it to other people who are, by their very nature, untrustworthy.
That is so right.
She's not the world's greatest flyer, let me tell you. When she was eight years old, she...
But... her army's so small now...
Yes.
A portrait? Do you ever see a portrait?
I hope you realize, Bill...in your office this morning, that was your time.
No!
How long have I got?
If you want a partner, I think you should recalculate the split.
Does the girl have a name?
You're putting me on the spot, Bill.
Okay.
I'm sure it's all right. My friend Max is cooking and he's acknowledged to be the worst cook in the world, but you know, you could hide the food in your handbag or something.
You'll be my date at my little sister's birthday party?
When you go, I go.
What are you saving for?
First and foremost, he's a MAN. You remind him of that fact, and he resents you for it.
I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name?
There'll be another train. The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there.
I'll see you later.
No. Women're always followin' me 'round.
What's up?
You're on a budget from now on.
Shut up!
Don't know, but he looks a lot more like Rosie O'Donnel than Ben Franklin.
Beat it!
A dollar sixty! . . . You had four dollars last night! How do you expect to get to New York at the rate you're going?
And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo?
Let's go the zoo.
Okay. I've been hogging it. You're right. 76.
Of course I do -- I never knew what money really meant till I started spending it. Do you know -- I can hardly believe that anything so beautiful should come to me from Preysing -- I'll take care of you. Will -- will you let me?
Any dope yet on how he got out?
Exclusive? That's great.
Never mind that. What's the story?
Smythe! I mean - when you're alone and want to amuse yourself, then what?
Found no skeletons?
Yes. Have you looked in the closets all over . . .?
It's haunted just the same.
Okay.
Then why did you have anything to do with him?
No.
I keep explaining. You've got the wrong man. My name is Bellini - Antonio Bellini. Bellini, Caravaggio, both painters, I think that is confusing you.
How can I? You lied to me -- the way Charles did -- and after promising you wouldn't. Oh, I want to believe you, Peter... oh, but I can't call you that anymore, can I? It will take me a while to get used to your new name -- which I don't even know yet. What is it? Aren't you going to tell me? Hello -- ?
If you do anything funny, or try to talk to anyone, I'll kill you, Dyle -- here and now. Okay?
I don't know.
These cases are harder on the doctor than on the patient. I ought to charge you by the mile.
Any of that coffee left?
She'll sleep on and off for the next twenty-four hours. Of course, she'll have a dandy hangover when she wakes up --
Just as long as she's okay.
You can't sleep. Come on, Fran -- open your eyes. Let's get her walking. We've got to keep her awake for the next couple of hours.
It's not important, Fran -- the main thing is that I got here in time -- and you're going to be all right -- -- isn't she, Doc?
But, if they send you away, then what is to become of me?
I have faced that problem before.
I believe they will deport you.
Have no fear. It will come out well for me.
But they will prevent a meeting at whatever the cost.
The Prince left him only that choice.
But how, sir?
Make your mind easy, you shall not be left behind, I warrant you. Do take a last look at your barracks, make your mind easy, say a farewell to your friends in Berlin. The dear souls, how they will weep when they hear you are out of the country, and, out of it, you shall go.
No shit! That why they call him Ice?
Look at 'em all. They love it. How in the hell'd we get Ourselves into this?
I had an idea your husband was getting suspicious.
Okay, okay.
BREAKING LEFT!
That stalker Ted got to you, right? You're working for him, aren't you, you little shit?
Who?
Whoa, whoa -- I don't know what you're talking about.
Maybe this'll jog your memory.
What's bothering you, huh?
Five more weeks of school. And ten minutes past graduation I'm gone. To freedom.
Looks like he planned, something. He shut up his apartment and his shop.
Yeah. Couldn't find a thing. This is the way we figure it. Wynant goes to Julia's apartment. He finds Morelli there... sees she's two- timing him. They have a fight. But he figures he don't want to do anything then.... Morelli might squeal. So he goes away. He don't let his lawyer know anything has happened... he lets him go ahead and and hand over money to Julia to give to him, so that Julia will think it's all blown over. Then, when she don't expect it... he lets her have it.
No proof?
What about the suicide?
Oh, that's a phoney. The men didn't even have to go down.
I thought it might be. From now on, they're going to think that every thin man over six feet with white hair is Wynant.
Nothing yet to cinch it.
Fifty will get you a hundred that he didn't do it.
Ah! But you don't know who Bobo is. And you don't know who Babykins is.
Now the lady said you may go
Well, I tell you, yesterday when I was here, I had one of your books in my hand, and when I got outside, I realized I still had your book in my hand. So as long as I had your book in my hand, I thought I might as well take it home and read it. This morning, I got up and put your book in my hand, and here's your book in your hand.
Yeah, that was considerate of me. I recommend you read it.
Well, maybe it's a bit heavy for you. Perhaps if you'd like something lighter - something with a touch of romance
Just listen to this Adorable Babykins Does her miss her Baby? Him sends his booful li'l sweetums a billion oceans full of kisses. Bobo is so lonely !
There's-there's-there's-there's Mr. When-in-the-Pink, Mr. Miami Beach, there, you know? He's the latest! just came back from the gin-rummy farm last night. He placed third.
Look at these guys.
Oh, that's hilarious. They're back from Fire Island. They're... they're sort of giving it a chance-you know what I mean?
Yeah, he's the Mafia. Linen Supply Business or Cement and Contract, you know what I mean?
No, I'm serious. I just got my mustache wet.
But you've a pension, haven't you, from the sale of his books?
Suppose that you bear five or six children with your characteristics. All in Siwash Cave. In a postcatastrophe world, your offspring would of necessity intermarry, forming in time a tribe. A tribe every member of which had giant thumbs. A tribe of Big Thumbs would relate to the environment in very special ways. It could not use weapons or produce sophisticated tools. It would have to rely on its wits and its senses. It would have to live with animals -- and plants! -- as virtual equals. It's extremely pleasant to me to think about a tribe of physical eccentrics living peacefully with animals and plants, learning their languages, perhaps, and paying them the respect they deserve.
What a beautiful thought, Marquise.
I've just got a few --
No. But one or two "borrowed ladders" have shown up there in the past.
Great... so how's everything with you?
Complicated. I couldn't stop her apologizing.
I think that went as well as could be expected.
She always looked out for me.
And she had private investigators assisting her.
She brought my digestive enzymes.
In anticipation of making you sick.
Maybe I should reconsider my...
You're a big help. Can I have one of those?
Maybe.
Or Tex?
Thanks a lot.
Get the fuck out of here, Jack.
Nice to see you.
I'm aware that I don't look so great, but I thought you'd be glad to see me.
This is too much. I can't handle this.
Why?
What do you mean?
Would you shhh! Mary's gonna hear us.
I think a little of both.
Jack. This week is not about me. It's about you. I'm going to show you a good time. We're going to drink a lot of good wine, play some golf, eat some great food, enjoy the scenery and send you off in style.
And get your bone smooched.
And Lexapro, yes.
Well, I say fuck that. You need to get your joint worked on, that's what you need.
I went on Monday. But I spent most of the time helping him with his computer.
Well, I say fuck therapy and what's that stuff you take, Xanax?
I'm working on it.
You still seeing that shrink?
Allie-girl...And Louisa! You're So lovely. I'm at your feet, Darlin'. Just at your feet. Guess it's only right. Ma always Said you were the prettiest.
You know what? Let's take the Santa Rosa turnoff and hit Sanford first.
I knew she was mute, but now I'm thinking it's more than that. I'm wondering if she's not brain affected.
Are you going to fire me, Bill?
How about you telling me? When I ask a simple question, I expect a straight answer. That's what I'm used to. Anybody who doesn't give it to me, I fire.
I wouldn't put it that way.
About Susan?
You tell me, Bill.
What way would you put it?
I don't know.
Why did you go to the hospital?
I guess...
You were just curious?
So how was your first and last day of branding?
You ever just stand still for a minute?
Well, if we're not gonna do it, let's just get in the car and get the fuck outta here.
Aaaahhhh!
We really stuck the knife in her, didn't we, Bert?
You don't pay me? You gonna get your thumbs broken. And your fingers. And if I want them to, your right arm in three or four places.
I'm a businessman, kid.
So you figure you're still my manager, huh?
Yeah, we're gonna make a lotta money together, from now on.
Well, you got a lot of games lined up for me?
No, it don't have to be fifty. It can be thirty... twenty-five.
Fifty per cent?
Said what!
What're you here for?
What?
You need a cut.
No.
Stay up here and finish your interview, I've got to see what the hell's going on down there before I can take responsibility for you to film there.
Jack, could you stay up here for a while?
I'm taking one of these men. Yates, come with me.
Believe me, I'm trying to get this over with as fast as I can. But Samuel will probably have to come back and testify.
Absolutely not. In fact, I picked up a bride yesterday; except she was a singer.
They kid a lot.
How do you do, Mr. McCord. We're trying to locate a deranged fan of yours,... a Ms. Betty...
What can I do for you, gentlemen?
That won't be necessary. She's staying with a Rosa something... Hernandez, Herrera. I know it's an 'H' sound... in Silverlake.
Deranged. That would be the right word.
You're doing this now? After all the... are you sick? Are you going to kill me now?
More than you know. Is there anything else?
Thanks so much. You must get bothered by this kind of thing a lot.
Listen, the last time I admitted to a woman I loved her ... I never saw her again.
...So Cornelius was telling the truth!
I'll help her, I promise, but I think you should tell me where the Stones are!
I... I don't know! We hardly know each other... it takes time!
I expected no less, Captain.
Especially so tonight, Major. In a few minutes you will see the arrest of the man who murdered your couriers.
Thank you.
Oh. This is... We d arranged to meet tonight and I m due to return to Paris tomorrow...
Whether crabs are in season there now...
Just south to Baltimore, Maryland. So I know what you're going to ask next. That you might ask -- I'm not certain.
Are you still coming?
Yeah, guy?
What does the old Timex say?
Hey...
What else could I have showed you, Homer? The only thing I can teach you is what I know! In every life, you've got to be of use.
One: it's illegal. Two: I didn't ask how to do it--you just showed me.
You know how to help these women-- how can you not feel obligated to help them when they can't get help anywhere else?
Lydia is the girl Parry likes... And I thought, if I could get them together I...
I was not with a woman last night. I was out with Parry.
That was a dance we invented at the International Sand Club.
Thanks.
I want to see that. Do you mind if I stay... on the side? I won't bother you.
You know I haven't been able to get near an airplane since the war. And even if I could, they wouldn't hire me because of my war record.
Elaine, not yet. I promise you I really can change.
Look, you'll be back in town tomorrow night. We'll have dinner -- talk it over.
Put my car in the garage and close the door.
You're the accountant inna family, and I figure you might know about these things. My boss wantsa sell his shop to me. His kids are all married, you know, and he and his wife live alone, and they wanna move out to California where his daughter lives, so he wantsa sell his shop. He wants five thousand dollars down, although I think I can knock him downa four...
Let me guess. His retinal plate is in there.
Can't be too careful.
Charged.
Packed.
Done. And I assume you have the magic CD- ROM?
Mattie. What about this?
Jesus! I'll kill him! I'll kill him. What did she tell him?
"Simon ate of the heart of the beast and his soul was cleansed." These pictures are not just myth, Andy. The scholars of the day used them to record facts and enlighten the public. This is the medieval version of a newspaper.
I don't believe we've been introduced.
What?... Oh, right, you can see these guys too. Jesus...
Oh sure, it was all mean old Marcel's idea. Give me a break! We didn't tell you because it's a wild goose chase! Not to mention disgusting. Look...
Tell you what, why don't you go on over to reception, tell them I said Mario should take you to the airport.
Okay, boys, let's have it.
Tomorrow.
Yes, we couldn't stop him. If you can find an unsigned copy, it's worth an absolute fortune.
Well, ideally, when I went back to the desk, you'd remove the Cadogan guide to Bali from your trousers, and either wipe it and put it back, or buy it. See you in a sec.
No, not yet.
That's what I want.
I'm not leaving Midge.
Peggy Sue's still stuck on treble without a cause.
How's my pregnant chick!
I had to excuse myself from a meeting. It's ridiculous. I kept thinking about the baby... you... and, I swear, I was going to start bawling right into my briefs.
I love you.
Good-night, folks.
Well, he didn't have it last night.
What's that?
Sure.
Yeah, but the thing about him, he's down with the flu. He's sick.
Yeah. I'd invite you inside, except it's contagious. Don't want to start an epidemic.
Where you been hiding, Dick?
How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
Cover up that transmitter!
Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
No -- don't out me off.
Drop it.
And you keep the records, or contribute to 'em.
Right!
Why, down at the office, we always look at Gallagher as - eh - just Gallagher, that's all.
We're not getting paid then.
What's it for?
I told you, Jack. It's a telethon. No one gets a cent.
Nothing. We get nothing.
What disease?
I don't know. Some disease.
Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
All I want's the money.
Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
What do you want to do?
I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all.
What do you mean?
Faith, sir, if I want to learn good principles, it's surely better I should apply for them to your lady, and your chaplin than to you?
We then spent an hour in the most eloquent silence except that, from time to time, her ladyship cried out: "Oh, my God. Is it true -- I am not dreaming?"
Sir William Cosgrove, with his complication of ills, was dying before us by inches. He was continually tinkered up by doctors, and, what with my usual luck, he might be restored to health and live I don't know how many years. If Cosgrove would not die, where was the use of my pursing his lady? But my fears were to prove groundless, for on that very night, patient nature would claim her account.
Let me give a thousand kisses to that heavenly mouth which has told me that I am happy.
I think, Sir William Cosgrove, you have had too much drink. Your chaplin, Mr. Hunt, has introduced me into the company of your lady to advise me on a religious matter, of which she is a considerable expert.
I beg your pardon?
That's not the point.
W-w-what has that got to do with this Maiden?
When are you going back?
Ah, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
COUGAR, THIS IS MAVERICK. I'M GETTING HUNGRY, LET'S HEAD FOR THE BARN. ...COUGAR, WHERE ARE YOU?
You.
Hey, if it was easy, everybody would want to come up here and do it..... Instead of just us.
You're going to have to earn your supper. I've got my final physical tomorrow.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?
Soy yo, Enrique! No tiene miedo--
They either say, 'Kill the nigger' or 'Hope you die, Honky.' -- What ya got in the bag?
Bingo!
I trust it's your size.
He's done some on-the-spot refit- ting. You could see the side flange was banged away to make room for the D-6.
Now I did some measuring down at the chandlery. A D-6 is one inch wider than a D-8. It would be too large for the deceased's well.
It is.
Two D-6's. That's the kind his well was fitted for.
Sheriff, how many batteries and what size did you find on defendant's boat?
No.
No spare.
Then help me, Sebastian. You're an important man in this town. If you'll help, the rest will.
It's happening. Isn't that a good enough reason?
How about giving me another coat?
Have we?--Well, I'd just as soon play shuffle-board.
That doesn't make any sense.
I'm sorry. Oh God, I'm sorry. I'm some kind of monster. I'm the guy you read about in the paper and go, "he's some kind of monster."
Are you any closer to a decision?
A picnic?
He excels at gratitude.
Who are you talking to Jack?
I know. Bandit two, bring yourself on in.
An unmarked police car.
Anything else you don't want me to know?
Never mind. It's nothing.
I'm sure the Arkansas Bears put out an all-points.
Nope. Just keep those wheels churning.
You don't even know me. The fact of the matter is there is some one I love. She's smarter, prettier... you don't even compare to her. The only reason I am here is because she wants us to be exclusive.
No. My uncle.
An ancient Japanese ceremony.
What?
It's quite safe, they are managing...
I'll be waiting on deck.
You know, we're branding here tomorrow. If you two want to come by to watch or give a hand, you're welcome.
Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
...He said that?
She loves you. I know that. And part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.
How sweet. Is that when you put the move on her?
How come you're not pukin'?
I guess I'm used to it. I've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.
Don't blame her, Rafe. It's not like you're thinking.
Fuck you.
There was a Prince, who was dying, and he was carried up the tower at Pisa so he could die with a view of the Tuscan Hills. Am I that Prince? Hana laughs.
Either way works for us...
Imagine for a moment that this. thing is not anything that can be identified because it prefers not to be, because it is the antithesis of all we are. Because it is evil.. TOTAL EVIL.
Find.
Cause I don't get it.
So why'd you give up ball?
I mean, Kyra hasn't heard the school thing yet. She'll probably say it's the painkillers talking.
Well, think it then, because it's true! We'll crucify that mob. We're going to keep Williams under cover till morning so the Post can break the story exclusive. Then we'll let the Governor in on the capture -- share the glory with him.
You've kicked over the whole City Hall like an apple-cart. You've got the Mayor and Hartman backed against a wall. You've put one administration out and another in. This isn't a newspaper story -- it's a career! And you stand there belly-aching about whether you catch an eight o'clock train or a nine o'clock train! Still a doll-faced mugg! That's all you are.
Attagirl! Why, they'll be naming streets after you -- Hildy Johnson Street! There'll be statues of you in the parks, Hildy. The radio'll be after you -- the movies! By tomorrow morning I'll betcha there's a Hildy Johnson cigar! I can see the billboards now. Light up with Hildy Johnson!
We're going to take him over to my private office. Where's our phone?
Not if he's inside the desk. We'll carry the desk over. Give me Duffy!
If you hadn't used profanity --
How come ya wanna hang out with those guys? They teach ya bad things.
What?
I think that's what I'm saying.
At the top of the Empire State Building --
Not really. Look, Annie, I love you. Let's leave that out of it. I don't want to be someone you're settling for. I don't want to be someone anyone settles for. I have a life insurance policy, I'm fully invested in growth stocks, I have a paid subscription to Home Rox Office, I have no sexual diseases, I have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, I have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, I dress nicely, I am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, I don't watch Monday Night Football, the only thing wrong with me is that I am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool. There are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring. If you don't -- marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?
We're not.
Well, actually, I thought I'd run an idea by you. You know, just to see if you're interested.
We don't chat.
Nope - just came by to chat
Are you lost?
Hey.
Does this conversation have a purpose?
But she can't go out with you because her sister is this insane head case and no one will go out with her. right?
Whatever you say, Mayonnaise.
Fall out on the lawn in five minutes, in your Poopie suits!
He said it's up to us and I got here first, didn't I?
Dance, Jack! The night's but begun.
-- understand what you're asking for here. The Massey pre-nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. No one can profit from the marriage. The pre-nup protects the wealthier party.
I'm in no mood for dancing.
Aye, Honeythorn Gump, come to serenade you, Jack... come to make you dance.
Faerie ring?
Oh, but you will be, Jack... Think you to sleep in a faerie ring and not spend the night a-dancing?
To be sure.
No! Tis not the time! I want no part of your frolic.
And without it, that party is exposed -- a sitting duck. No wriggle room.
-- and we are sure...
Well, George Viznick is in the grayest of gray areas in the sanity spectrum. Viznick is not psychotic. He's simply unable to submit to any higher authority.
No, the less mystifying. Good and evil are only illusions. There is no such thing as evil with a capital "E." That suggests some third party bad guy pulling all the strings.
There weren't any voices.
As if there's another cause for little voices? No, Sally, Viznick's a manipulator, he's clever, he has what I call malignant narcissism.
Well, we all have a degree of narcissism, Sally, but a malignant narcissist is dangerously self-obsessed.
Uh, I'd rather not say.
The guy at the hotel told me he always wears a gold medallion, and usually has a book or magazine with him.
I thought I put you to bed.
Tell me more about yourself.
But happy. Very happy, Peggy Sue.
I thought you were...for a while.
. Peggy Sue, I love you, and I need you Peggy Sue...
Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
Listen, Rock, you're a very lucky guy.
I'm usta seein' ya at the gym, but seein' ya here, in my house, it's kinda outta joint.
How do you mean?
Hey, Mickey -- Whatta ya doin' here? Here, sit down.
I seen the light. I figure somebody was home.
What's happened is freak luck.
That's good.
I was wrong.
A leader, like Laszlo?
It's too loud for me.
Thank you...
Misha! Misha!
What is it?
Not now he don't.
Maybe the maid did it.
...and one helluva guy.
Practically no one.
To have achieved one's ambition, or to have reconciled oneself to its limits, is a lifetime's work.
I do what I do.
Remember. One chorus and out.
Yeah. How much?
Do you tell lies?
What?!?!
What are you doing here?
Now it's okay?
Who is it?
The man you had the fight with.
10,000 gold crowns.
No, it's not... Come here...
Ugh, these tapes are a mess. I don't know where to begin...
And the point is?
Because you don't pull this on someone who's about to get married.
Hello?
And then I got scared, George, and closed the doors. I . . . I . . . I . . .
Holy mackerel!
Yes, hello? George . . . it's Potter.
The whole town's gone crazy.
You may use my office.
I'll need to make a phone call.
You haven't changed. You still think the sun rises and sets on your ass. Well, guess what, it doesn't.
I have the Director's word, there will be no action against them. You may go once we have the disks.
And the students?
You have the letter and my word, if you wish you may wait upstairs....Now, where are the disks?
How do I know this isn't a trap?
What?
No, the morning rooster woke me.
I must. Look-- how pale the window.
Oh
Well perhaps better than my first.
Maybe, once.
Yeah seems okay.
Good, great....Dobchay!
...Maybe a picture of me in the liner notes...
Let's not.
I want a tape.
Good.
When did you learn about his taste for kids, huh? On your honeymoon? Or was it later, when bitterness set in and you turned against your beloved but weak little brother? How did you find out? Did he confess? Try to convert you perhaps? Or was it woman s intuition? Or just the way he fucked you?
You know he d have had him killed, don t you? Does a conscience still burn somewhere inside your sore mind, Deborah? Or is it just cold expediency? Could the boy perhaps come in useful when and if the day ever comes for you to face up to the man you married?
I ve had a long and unpleasant day. I m tired and I m angry. But mad? Not yet. I paid Leon s boy a visit this morning. Found him alive and well. Why haven t you told your husband where he is since reading my note, eh?
But one suggestion, madame. Not the major. I don't mind his grammatical mistakes. I'll overlook his bad punctuation. But the letter has no mystery--no bouquet--no ... And one lipstick ... Scarlet number four.
Why do girls like that always like guys like that?
All right. Pay attention.
Do you remember high school?
And that is how you talk to a girl, Rat. Voila. You can't miss.
You wuss. It's no problem. One person says something to the other and that's how it starts...
What happens now?
What about her.
You wanna talk about --
Mayo, are those your friends?
Because it happened to be a colored policeman.
It's simple. A poor little dope who lost his job went berserk and shot a cop who was coming after him to quiet him down.
All you've got to do is talk to him. But the Mayor would hang his own grandmother to be re-elected.
But couldn't you show the man wasn't responsible?
Especially with an election coming up in a few days.
Are you sure Williams is not all there?
Forgive me for askin', son, and I don't mean to belabor the obvious, but why is it that you've got your head so far up your own ass?
How?
I know what that's like.
She want to play? Fine. I can play.
I see. Well, thank you very much. You've been very, very nice.
Thirty-five.
Good night! Sleep tight. Don't let the bedbugs bite! That's what my Mom always says... ...who I'm really beginning to miss. I'm sorry. It's my first night away from home.
How old do I look?
Lena?
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this.
I thought they'd talk to him. Try to get him to dummy up.
Maybe he gave them an argument.
You said they was only going to talk to him.
That was the idea.
This one has a special meaning.
Do it then. Get the dog picked up. I can't believe you let it stay there.
Good-bye. Well, your luck is holding. They sublet your place. You're homeless. Frank's got a line on another place you can use for now.
Another place where?
Does it matter?
What do you mean? You said you liked it.
The whole town's in an uproar. We've got to find him. The letter's our only clue.
They found him in his office this morning-- beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.
Is that everybody?
Oh, don't you worry. I'll be fine.
You've been a hell of a figment, pal. I sure wish I could take you home with me.
Move it. We got exactly five minutes left.
It's just...now that I'm leaving, I feel like there's lots of things I haven't said. Who's gonna look out for you? Are you gonna be okay when I'm gone?
You saved my life, Monkeybone. I never would've made it without you.
So who you going to the dance with, Spalding?
Didn't know you cared so much.
And?
Why she gotta be a ho, just cause she wants to get with me.
I haven't been a detective for four years.
That's all right. What are you drinking?
Hello, Macaulay. Come in.
My wife's father died and left her a lumber mill and a narrow guage railroad and a couple of other things. And I'm looking after them.
Ah, well, I bought her this huge pumpkin for Halloween, but she couldn't bear to carve it so she saved it for weeks, and it ended up under the Christmas tree.
I told you about the pumpkin didn't I?
Why, that's an echo, sir!
Keep the advice. Give me the whiskey.
Give me a double.
No?
No advice. Just whiskey.
Hit me again.
There was a result to what you did. It wasn't just another expedition. It did this. If the British hadn't unearthed your nosey photographer in Cairo thousands of people could have died.
Where?
No. We have to try. We'll figure something out. And if midnight comes before we can get to him, well, then we go together. Deal? Shake a paw?
I told her his blood pressure went up after a little incident at the hotel.' She seems to hate him more than ever.
Then tell him to wax it too.
I think I can work it out on my own.
Nope.
I've heard of you, too. You were in 124 with Bargamian.
It's not Cougar's place. It's ours.
I'm gonna call her.
No, she's all right. She's still here. But I'll get her home soon.
Sounds great to me, I'm going to call her, that's what's cool about her.
No. She's in fine shape. Nothing to worry about. But she doesn't know. You understand that. She doesn't know what she did.
Well, Muddy, we can look at all these angry stars Homer's been readin' to us about.
Homer, you the only one who's read them rules, so you the only one who feels like he's doin' somethin' wrong.
Are we supposed to be up here? The rules said...
You lucky you in your work boots tonight, girl...
You think so, Jack? Well... I wouldn't want to be in that Wally's shoes tonight.
Very talented.
Yeah! Shh!
And you dropped it?
I better clean this up before she sees it.
That's funny!
You thought I was Mom?
It's just this get-up. The girl's out and I was bringing Mom's supper.
Yeah!
Well, I feel I owe you something for all this...
I appreciate the offer. And it's tempting.
Then will you for me?
If the fruit burst into flames I'll be prepared.
I know. But then I reconsidered. 'Cause I figured out what I really wanna do with my life, what I want to do for a living is I wanna be with your daughter. I'm good at it.
Alright, alright. Go ahead. When I'm old, give me someone like me, but go ahead.
Forget it.
Last?
What else could it be?
I vant to suck your blood. I also vant to suck your Twinkie.
Think there be truth only in beauty, lad? If you've the courage to ask and take care to avoid her terrible claws, Jenny Greenteeth has the answers you seek.
I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
Sometimes.
Guests.
I had it coming from someone.
These are worth at least, I don't know --
But you must have --
True... But it won't come easy or free. If ye want to ask, ask Jenny Greenteeth.
Remember, pay attention to how she talks about Foley, her tone. Do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell Burdon. Tell her you think he's a nice guy. No, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. If she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her? I bet nothing. So she still likes him enough to stick her neck out. You think that's possible? What kind of guy is he?
Shit.
And you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.
Her phone's probably tapped.
But you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.
He remind you of that guy, Tillman?
Maybe. But you're also curious about the man. Twice last night you asked your married boyfriend Nicolet about him. You were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.
You know the main staircase in the opera?
How do you like that? Here I am being nice to you and your sweet-heart and that's the thanks I get!
Just wanted to surprise you, I guess. Down! After you, Bruce! Come on, Hildy, my treat!
Not when they're sung by extraterrestrials.
Well, both.
The question is, do we need her?
Make three reservations on the first train out to Mandrake Falls, Vermont.
I'll do no such thing. I'm going there myself. You're going with me too, Anderson - and you too, Cobb.
Thank heaven.
Will you come home and forget all about him?
No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.
Yeah - go on.
Hey. I guess there's a lot of things we don't know about each other.
That's real big of you.
I don t know...
This isn t my real life. It s just a glimpse...
Go on - hit me!
You're kidding. You wrote a song? Is it about a guilty girl and a trusting guy... she wants to hurt him, and he wonders why?
Well, if you don't know I can't tell you.
Uh-huh. Why?
Jill.
Bye, Adam!
And thanks for always being happy!
Bye, Troy!
All right. All right. I just cleaned B-8. Give me a break.
What?
Yes, of course. Lots of questions.
Hey, that's not so bad. Compare it to the Love Canal -- that was twenty years ago, and those people still haven't seen a dime. So in legal terms, ten years is --
You haven't finished your beer.
Boys, boys... don't forget Russia is your mother country. Three sons walking out all at once... that's too much for any mother.
Leon, how would you like to have three lifelong friends?
Well, if your mother turns against you, you have to look for someone to adopt you.
You have a headache?
I think I'll go see Debi today.
I mean, you commit to a wedding. And then it seems like... this... momentum, you know? You forget you... chose it.
Dance card filled?
Can I take you someplace to hear something nice?
Hi.
Then you go into the foyer.
Vada, try to scrunch these chairs together a little more.
Well then, how do you know?
I'll wait.
You sure you don't want to drive with me?
Mother, you know, I can see right through you right back to your back collar button . . . trying to get rid of me, huh?
No. You are the undead. You will live forever if you give me your Twinkie. Come on, let's have it. You hate them anyway.
Then perhaps the temptation to kill would have been stronger... too strong perhaps...?
We have numerous witnesses who can confirm that you were not always carrying your banner...
Why?
Then I'd think there must be a reason.
And he carried you like this, I suppose.
Your father didn't know beans about "piggy-back" riding.
I don't think there's a "piggy- back" rider in your whole family. I never knew a rich man yet who was a good "piggy-back" rider.
To be a "piggy-backer" it takes complete relaxation a warm heart and a loving nature.
Not a one.
Have we turned grave-robber, then?
There it be, lad. The Lindfarne Mound. Kings long forgotten lie there, lost in their final sleep.
No, it's kissing again. You don't want to hear it.
And who might that be?
I'm the distraction that's going to England with her sir. Are you alright sir? Are you okay?
Sir! I have to talk to you.
Oh, Betty. I take it you're going to be making the wedding cake and they say you're throwing --
When you see Debi, tell her I'm sorry.
Yes, I am. And who are you?
It's a matter of great importance to me!
What are you talking about?
You called me Oz.
I know, it sucks!
Ooh, my suits are ready...
I have to get my head back into my work.
Cinderella Man! That's sensational, Babe! Sensational!
How'd you get the picture?
How you doin' Mister D?
Well, that's kind of how I am right now.
I love you.
You know how it is sometimes when you're out playing ball with your friends? How you're really concentrating on what you're doing -- and you lose track of time and you come home late and Mom yells at you?
Your grades for fall semester. They're -- good.
Thank you.
You came here to give me my report card?
What's that to you?
I don't know.
Except for Small Eyes.
I don't want anyone to die.
Nobody's that unhappy.
I've got news for you. It's not working.
Hello?
Hi, Lydia.
Ok.
Yeah, I'll stay.
Well, well. That takes it out of the rumor class, doesn't it?
A statement? Good.
We admit nothing. However, I have a little statement all prepared.
No one would have thought it of me. I've been getting rusty in Fredersdorf. Well, if bluff is what the world wants I guess I can put up as big a bluff as anyone. From now on...
You must go to Manchester at once yourself and really see it through.
Bluff -- Bluff -- all bluff.
What's bluff?
That.
'Deal with Manchester definitely off! "Preysing, oh -- I'd never have thought it of you.
You let me talk till I'm hoarse and you had Manchester sewed-up all the time. Why?
What's the matter with you?
Totally. She came apart like a house of cards. They dropped the charges...
Goddamn... how 'bout Jasmine?
-- small-time, pissant, Barney Fife --
SHUT UP! Shut the fuck up, both of you, before I kill you!
I'm the one who watched the show... I was...
Did Chloe crack?
That's a lie! I figured it out! I've been trying to tell this dumbass --
Fuck you, Roy Ostrey!
Mademoiselle.
Very well.
Mademoiselle.
Captain Renault, I am under your authority. Is it your order that we come to your office?
Let us say that it is my request. That is a much more pleasant word.
This is hardly the time or the place.
Then we shall state another time and another place. Tomorrow at ten in the Prefect's office, with Mademoiselle.
I've never accepted that privilege, and I'm now on French soil.
I should like to discuss some matters arising from your presence on French soil.
Must be nice having kids.
No, your kids.
A little place with cabins. The something-Motor Inn. I haven't checked in yet.
As long as it takes, I might stay a week. No more I don't think. Where's your family?
Umm...can you come in for a minute?
And I have two choices. I can either fight the way things are, or accept them. See, I always knew I loved you more. Didn't bother me. I always felt lucky... a little amazed... that such a vibrant, beautiful woman would want to be with a man like me... And I guess I thought as long as I did everything right -- if I was the best husband I could be, the best father... even being a good lawyer only mattered to me because of what it meant for us... if I could do all that, it wouldn't make any difference if we loved each other the same or not... I wasn't asking for more. I told myself I didn't need more. But you don't know how you feel about me. You don't know... if you want a life with me anymore... And I don't want you to come home until you do know... ... one way or the other.
I won't apologize for this. And I won't hide it. Not for anybody.
Me neither, 'cause of my Mother. She's a curse, my Mamma, a tornado. Stubborn as a mule! I was engaged... for a week. After that, Mamma was so mad, I tell you, pasta was bouncing off the walls.
Say, what kind of a pal are you? You're not going to leave me flat?
But back in '34, Japanese-born could not own land. So...?
Gallagher and myself just came over here to do a little work on a story -
No.
No, we're not!
That is bullshit! Mine is a bitch and yours is a psycho. I can't believe you're saying this, Marylin! There's nothing wrong with us. We're attractive and charismatic and successful and... I like us.
Don't go. Stay with me for a while.
I have to say -- I'm speechless. No. I'm never speechless.
A more modest expedition, or even wait a year. Remind our families we still exist.
I won't hear of it. None of us will.
Mrs. Clifton, you'll have to forgive us. We're not accustomed to the company of women.
Of course. Well, we should all go out onto the terrace.
I'm afraid we're not having much luck obtaining funds for the expedition.
...that's a good motto.
Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
I wanted to make a statement.
Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
It's not here. Let's go.
... Not at all.
Suspicious, after all these years?
You better not be taking on a new partner.
You change partners, you change the rules.
You damn well thought wrong.
I know. I don't get it.
I'm terribly sorry old man.
Hello?... Hi Raymond.... What?... Well, I was sort of planning on... Alright... Okay, goodbye. That was Sattler. He thinks the D.A.'s going to file on Rebecca Lawson. He wants me in the office tomorrow morning.
I think that's what you ordered.
She's a perfectly happy eleven year old girl, look, don't give me any advice about my daughter, okay?
She was raised in a funeral home, she knows a thing or two about it.
Wow, this is the coolest thing, like you really eat and sleep here?
Tomorrow collect from Del Rio -- He's late three weeks. How'd you do last night?
I thought you -- Why -- Love ruins everything, doesn't it?
Remember me? I'm the fellow you slept on last night.
What's the matter? Wouldn't the old meanies wait for you? Say, how old are you anyway? Don't you know these busses work on a schedule? You need a guardian.
Because it's true.
What do you mean they might -- they will!
We don't blame you, Leon, but when we came from Russia we believed in simplicity...
Hi, Loretta.
I do.
You take care.
What do you think? Any chance? There's nothin' else I'm any good at, but this.
We can't do this.
That's why we have to be careful -- we don't want to involve anybody -- after all, Mr. Sheldrake is a married man --
Miss Kubelik, I don't think you ought to call anybody -- not till that chewing gum is out of your head.
I didn't mean it that way -- I was just talking to him on the phone -- he's very concerned about you.
Out in the fresh air, nice gringo lady making you pies--who's gonna sit back in a little jail cell all day? Sheriff Buddy, man. Como el no hay dos. And after that cabron Charley Wade--
I mean maybe you should check with us before you go off and book us a month in advance.
Be reasonable, Jack.
That takes care of this week. The tenth we got the Sheraton, the sixteenth we're at the Capri.
I can't make the tenth.
What do you mean?
The tenth's out.
What?
This thing means that much to y...
My lady VIOLA.
I -- I --
How soon can it be altered?
An enormous amount of money changed hands to get control of this project. We are in little danger of being left alone for long. You'll need to do something. Otherwise they'll be sending someone out to recover you.
Gibarian said he thinks Solaris should be destroyed.
That's ludicrous. This is contact. We have found God. The only issue is figuring out how to prove this in a way that will make sense back on Earth. So how will we describe it, if we choose to describe it at all?
What are you going to report back to Earth?
I don't know.
It s not me. I swear. It s her. She s magic.
Thank you.
For everything.
Urrggghh...
Listen...maybe I can get you a year.
Not to worry. So... see you tonight, right? Right?
What are you talking about? You love your job.
I hate this job.
Then it sounds like I'm doing you a favor.
I didn't know there would be a quiz, George.
It may sound that way, but I react out of fear. My life has nothing to do with what I like or don't like. You haven't been listening, have you?
I said, I come to town with a girl.
Sure, but it s never easy. They say they re okay with it, and they are...for a while. Then one day, they re not.
Yo, Mike -- What's happenin' here?
The tennis player?
No.
Bye, Betty. Thanks.
She says 'Hello' to you. Go for it John!
No, no...
You're asking for my documents?
So how long will you be in England?
You must have a visa or something...
Plans are for the architects, politicians and so forth.
Come on, that shit can wait.
No problem, is it at your place?
Miss Vivian... there's a salon here in the hotel. Instead of worrying unnecessarily about table manners, why don't you just have your hair done instead?
I can tell you exactly.
And that's something we owe to Ninotchka.
If you hadn't given Commissar Razinin such a wonderful report about us, who knows what would have happened?
Whatever you say...honey.
Gimme a kiss.
It's terrific.
Hey, listen, listen.
No, I'm not gonna letcha. You have a great voice.
Yeah!
Fats knew the game was in the clutch, knew he had to do something to stop ya. He played it smart.
Thanks much, Silver Tongued Devil.
Well?
I'll call you.
Who?
A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
How can I see her, to know her?
What are you gonna do?
Well I'm sure that's really important, but I don't want to tell some eight- year-old kid he has to sleep in the street because we want people to feel better about their cars. Do you want to tell him that?
So we're spending forty-seven million dollars to make people feel better about a car they've already bought?
Jack, are you really dead?
What do you think?
Do you think I need a haircut?
A-Okay. Got my gloves on, my ears pricked. I'm ready for action.
Nothing.
Tanks, huh?
Sounds good.
Yer damn right.
No thanks.
Tonight let's not represent anybody but ourselves.
Hello.
I like it. I like it. I'm sorry I don't seem more appreciative.
No problem. I'll leave you two alone. I can tell you guys have something on the fire --
That's very gracious of you, Quince.
Who?
Conflict, honey. Korean Conflict.
Of course.
Yes, where? -- in fifteen minutes. I'll be there.
A monster. I know, I know.
Oh, you've a great gift for rhyme.
You mean he might have -- Mr. Bartholomew, I'm catching the next plane out of here -- I'm not going to sit here and wait for someone to make chopped liver out of me!
Where are you now -- can you meet me? Do you know Les Halles?
He's really very short on charm.
Yeah... me too.
Edward. My name is Edward.
Of course.
Cat. That's simple. I like it. Hi, Cat.
You smell gas?
Is that the only reason you came back?
Sure. What other reason would there be?
What did you come back for?
Like I told you, half those horses are mine. I'm makin' sure they get to the ranch safe. So let's quit arguing and do whatever you figure on doin'.
You'll get your share. Go on. I don't want you around.
Half of them are mine.
I just wondered. Let's go.
No, sir?
She wasn't so bad.
Hello, Ralph. How'd you make out with those nurses last night, Ralph?
Hello, Lou, Angie come in yet?
Who told you that?
I have no money!
I won't pay for nothing.
Yeah, very big, a giant.
I'll take you to the bar, after that, you're on your own.
I don't think this is a good time...
Hello?
That was him.
You told him I was here and he wanted to know if I was beating you up.
Oh, Christ.
Well, did you get a job out of it at least?
Anybody want a peanut?
Check...
No more rhymes now, I mean it.
I'm me... I mean, that's me.
Daddy, I'm in big fuckin' trouble and I really need your help.
Clarence, just shut up, you're giving me a headache! I can't believe how much like your mother you are. You're your fuckin' mother through and through. I haven't heard from ya in three years. Then ya show up all of a sudden at eight o'clock in the morning. You walk in like a goddamn bulldozer... don't get me wrong, I'm happy to see you... just slow it down. Now, when did you get married?
Daddy. Nice isn't the word. Nice is an insult. She's a peach. That's the only word for it, she's a peach. She even tastes like a peach. You can tell I'm in love with her. You can tell by my face, can't ya? It's a dead giveaway. It's written all over it. Ya know what? She loves me back. Take a seat, Pop, we gotta talk -
Pop, there's no way an Ivy League Team is going all the way.
Meet me onboard, sweetheart. I have to pick up a few things at the drugstore.
I'm familiar with your work, Doctor. You'll have to excuse me, I have to go.
Elaine, what happened to us?
Elaine.
Wait here. Don't move.
Can you tell me something? Did you lose your mind all of a sudden or was it a slow gradual process?
Um...I've got to run. I've bee doing this all day. Are you going to be all right?
Are you sure?
Can I help?
It would be better that you tell her to get off her knees and show some civility to her six-day lord and master.
Bollocks, I m sorry. I had no idea this would be so difficult.
I've got it. He bends down and bites the back of her neck.
Find out.
Okay. A 5 raise, and --
A ten percent raise and benefits. But that's it. I'm drawing the line.
I have to talk to you..
It's stopped.
Oh it's nothing. I knew it. I told Roberto "He's very good that little Frenchman, very good". I lost my title but I won a watch!
Something the matter?
Oh...
How you doing, Cato?
If I see him.
I've given it up.
Thank you.
Try speaking to me?
...Well, my wife has me between a rock and a hard place.
Thanks coach.
Dad, please stop. Please. I'm sure I know what you're talking about.
Yes.
Aw hell, let's have a quickie right here--
I'm starting to understand what you're teaching me. I mean the panties and the nostrils and all that shit...I mean I'm getting it--
I couldn't dump my old man but maybe later I can sneak away from him...
I'm responsible for you now, you know. The Chinese say that once you have saved someone's life, you are responsible for it forever. And so I'm committed. And I have to know.
What was it inside that told you to jump?
What?!
Home?
Oh, yeah.
Come on -- I've got something that stings like crazy.
What'd you tell your father?
Look. Talk. Not talk.
I met a man with sharp nails.
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's impolite to -- What happened?
Better find our bonus baby, eh?
Ain't he warning up?
Hello, David. I am Dr. Hirsch and this is a countryman of yours, Mr. Collins.
Where am I?
That would be Jack Goodman, the boy who was killed.
The police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. He must have been a very powerful man. Although I really don't see that it is any of your concern, Miss Price.
Oh, Miss Price?
What exactly did he call out?
And then, something did. Carl Heine was found dead. With his head crushed.
Up in the air? Was that your reaction?
Why not?
But if truth was on your side, whatever were you worried about?
Just a whore, I go over there, have a few drinks and get my gun off. I'm through with her, she's nothing but a whore.
Ever been to Wisconsin?
Well they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice- fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice- fishing's where you chop a hole in the --
Sorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here.
And that's tough, isn't it?
-- these bastards have me hemmed in.
He's climbing the rope. And he's gaining on us.
I look around, I see a lot of dry eyes. The Director was not... ...universally loved. He was leading the cut-backs in the program. You're looking at a room full of motives.
According to this, he's a sick man. Congenital heart condition. Who knows how long the specimen has been here but there's an 80 percent chance the owner of that eyelash has already died himself from natural causes.
Even if this Vincent Luca is alive, is it likely he could bludgeon a man to death?
Pleasant?
Excuse me, have you seen The Feminine Mystique? I lost my copy.
I heard there was a poetry reading.
Mr. Thomerson.
You know how to drive one of these things?
Really?
You okay?
Shit! No one's here.
Lar... sometimes when people are mad they say things they don't mean.
I get that feeling, yeah.
I'll make you a deal. Get out of here. Right now. I'll do the job with the Snoop, meet you wherever you want and give you half.
Oh. Okay. I gotcha.
Oh yeah.
I was playing a trick. I-I-I had a baseball.
Your mother? Jesus, Miles, we were supposed to be up there hours ago.
I thought we could just say a quick hello to my mother.
What?
I've just got to make one quick stop. Won't take a second.
Whoa, why are we getting off?
I love you.
How old's she going to be?
It's her birthday tomorrow. And I don't feel right driving by her house and not stopping in, okay? It'll just take a second. She's right off the freeway.
Huh! You understand how I feel. How long was it we had, honey?
Has it got a wow finish?
Well, go on, tell it. Maybe one will come to you as you go along.
Yes, that's very pretty. I heard a story once. As a matter of fact, I've heard a lot of stories in my time. They went along with the sound of a tinny piano playing in the parlor downstairs, "Mister, I met a man once when I was a kid," it'd always begin. Huh. I guess neither one of our stories was very funny. Tell me, who was it you left me for? Was it Laszlo, or were there others in between? Or aren't you the kind that tells?
Apparently, Gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. Lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. She said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.
Honey, I hope you're not endangering your position. Listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, I'll work it out. I mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.
Huh-huh. You?
I wish I did.
Well, uh the real reason I called, actually, was to tell you I saw Lucy at Jo-Jo's tonight and she seems very worried.
A jogger, huh?
Knows nothing of a grave out at Mission Dolores, or an old house an Eddy Street, or a portrait at the Palace of the Legion of Honor?
Oh, I'm just typing up a funeral notice, you know when someone dies people want it in the paper usually, it's a service we provide for the family.
Okay, OW!
I'll give it everything.
It's either going to be Denver or San Diego trading up to take him.
Mind if I throw up?
Please, Drew.
Yes...I've found that it does.
Yes...
I don't know.
Toast? No...just the butter.
This is great. I'll be able to watch your act every night.
You want me to walk you?
That job you were talkin' about, did you get it yet?
Where you going?
Goodnight, Miss Wells.
Did God forbid you to tell the truth?
Huh?
A list.
I'm warning you -- it'll be a Federal offense. And you'll be an accessory!
We'll take a chance on that, Burns. Go ahead, boys.
Yes! What are you afraid of Hildy? I dare him to move that desk out of here.
Hartman, if you take this desk out of this building, I'll put you behind bars.
You will, eh? Well, we'll see about that. All right, boys. Take it.
I'll show you what I'm doing. Burns, you're guilty of obstructing justice and so is the Morning Post. I'm going to see that the Post is fined ten thousand dollars for this.
You'll see nothing of the kind, Sheriff.
We'll just start by impounding the Post property. Is that your desk?
Virge, you're makin' the arrest. You make contact, I'll back you Up. Morgan'll back me up, Doc'll Keep an eye out for trouble. And Keep your hands on your guns. They even look like they're gonna Start something, buffalo 'em. Right over the head.
Wyatt, I know what I'm doin'.
My son? I ain't got no son. You Duff?
Yeah, okay.
I've had this feeling -- ever since I've graduated -- this -- kind of compulsion that I have to be rude all the time. Do you know what I mean?
But could you try?
That ought to be fun.
Binge?
He called me chicken.
You got some kind of list?
So then you moved?
They think I'll make friends if we move. Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine.
But you don't think that's a solution.
Why weren't you honest with me? Why did you keep your marriage a secret?
Sure, after a fashion.
Let me try.
Worse than your Kraft Holiday dip?
I just hope those plates aren't radioactive by tomorrow morning.
You hear that?!
Yeah, yeah. Okay. Give me the roast and watch your step. I'll come back for the radio.
Try it. It feels good.
Do whatever you want with it. I don't care. All I want from you is for you to remember we built this house together.
We haven't build shit. You're just tearing down your father.
Twenty years of hating what you live in...what you are. This is the end of it, Sam. I'm gonna build something of me here that I can be proud to give to you.
Don't. I don't want it.
At least up there your piss will be worth something. You'll all be showering in it, right?
Try it... it'll add years to our sex life.
Yeah, but no presents till midnight.
Yeah, hey, why don't yuh try it on?
Happy birthday.
He's a gentleman. Gentleman gambler. He gets his kicks playing with hustlers. He's got an old Southern mansion with a pool table in the basement, drinks eight-year-old bourbon, smokes cork-tipped cigarettes.
What? And he -- he hustles pool?
James Findley is a very rich man. Grandfather left him twenty per cent of a tobacco company.
Lots of action. Lots of money. Lots of class. You'll see some of the best-dressed and most beautiful women in the world at the races. Knock your eye out.
You, uh, you ever been to Louisville during Derby week, Miss, ah, Packard?
It always takes me a little while to get a name fixed in my mind. Are you sure you don't want anything?
I don't know. Never saw him play. They say he's one of the best.
How good is he?
Her car is gone.
Nothing to be sorry about. That's the way with men and women, isn't it?
No. No. We got disconnect -- why?.....you're calling me at work....how did you get this number -- ?
Hello?
This makes me very uncomfortable.
I don't have a girlfriend --
And drinking it. It's like Evian by the time it's filtered.
No!!!
Hello?
How are you?
That's up to Pilgrim.
What I mean is, your wealth is completely protected.
But?
You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
In this house, you're supposed to.
Are you all right?
Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
What are you doing with that?
Forbear this outrage, good Mercutio.
-- and wanted to go on loving you." And I said, "I won't lose you." But I did.
You're Pam?
Hi. You're here for the sex talk?
I need you.
It's a crowd-tickler--mistaken identities, a shipwreck, a pirate king, a bit with a dog, and love triumphant.
I'll be back when we lose.
He said if I gave in to you I'd start losing again.
I did.
You're exotic and mysterious and cute--that's why I better leave.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Look, I don't mean to be rude, but this is not as easy as it looks. So I'd appreciate it if you wouldn't distract me.
That does put a damper on our relationship.
If you're in such a hurry, you could lower a rope, or a tree branch, or find something useful to do. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 26.
That's very comforting. But I'm afraid you'll just have to wait.
Right now -- I'm at the epitome of my life. Right now I feel so good I'm afraid something's gonna happen.
Don't you ever stop talking?
Where do you live?
Here's the news: He hasn't been in Portugal since '90. I know that from the file. Why don't you read the file, man?
Where does she live?
Enzo...
Jacques, my friend, how are you?
Now, please, Ninotchka, don't start figuring it out in cows.
They won't come anyway.
Did you get a good look at the man who attacked you?
Sure, as a kid. But never so real. Never so bizarre.
You've never had bad dreams before?
Yes.
I've told you, it wasn't a man. It was an animal. A big wolf or something. A rabid dog.
Here they are again. Look at 'em.
Yeah, well, I swore a lot of things.
Yes, I know.
That's good. You never would have recognized me, huh? Check out the suit! Looking good, no? You know I'm the world champion?
Alright... By all means. Make yourselves at home.
Why, yes! My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed. I need four thousand pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work--I fancy tobacco has a future. We will not stay there long, three or four years . . .
I am aware of it, but it is beauty's privilege.
No. I have spoken to the Queen. Her majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife, and once gained, her consent is her command.
How your mind hops about! Your father was a shopkeeper, your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune. That is the only matter under discussion today. You will like Virginia.
And there's her mother - and what a character that old dame would make with her double-strength - and that lawyer friend of theirs - he'd make a great villain - and there's you!
Well, I don't know if --
You're here because you figured I might show up.
There's another one!
Go. Flee.
Land of the free...
Jerry! You made it --
You keep out of this-- You admit you thought of killing him--how were you going to do it?
Why?
Hello, Harvard! Got anything new on the hanging?
Beats king up.
Why? We're only talking.
I'm Chairman.
It's that woman from the coach!
What the hell is happening to me?!
Basically, it s my car now. Get in.
Might wanna fasten your seat belt, Jack...
Miss me, Jack?
It s a callable asset seized in accordance with the acquisition by-laws of your alt-fate contract...
That s my car! You stole my car!
Okay... Would you rather... commit yourself sexually to a four-by-nine cell with former President George Herbert Walker Bush dressed as a super-model for a month, or make love to a otter on crank for a week?
I fear, too early: for my mind misgives Some consequence yet hanging in the stars Shall bitterly begin his fearful date With this night's revels and expire the term Of a despised life closed within my breast By some vile forfeit of untimely death. But He, that hath the steerage of my course, Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
Hello?
You killed him. You killed him -- and I got you off.
Yes, M'sieu Filiba?
Excuse me???
Oh, yeah. There.
And you saw them happen?
That's all, Miss Bennett.
Are they true!
But they did take place?
OK, but remember that they wear it because they have to. I wear it because I want to. That'll make me look different. Let's get a drink.
That's all, Miss Bennett. That's all.
Oh, uh, right, thanks...
You don't wanna be standing there, the hacks start asking questions you don't wanna answer.
Use your head. The guys got five million lying around his house, you really think he's gonna tell some motormouth he just met in prison about it?
Give me that.
Oh, Mother will give us the blue room. You haven't a red room, have you? Well, bless her heart. Wouldn't that be nice! My, oh my - six rooms and two baths and a blue room. I guess she would let us have the right wing if we needed it, wouldn't she?
Would you like me to take you through your lines?
Oh, no, darling. There's more sex appeal coming on the first of the month. It's only ten days ... Eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
Beautiful. And what of it? Let me tell you something: so far as I'm concerned, her whole sex appeal is in that safe!
Really?
I see, we won't need that. Plenty of room, plenty of room.
They come in all sizes honey, just like shoes.
Tell me that it's silly of me to be apprehensive.
Do me an enormous favor?
Plus, even it was true, he'd still have to figure out where I keep 'em.
Mr. Kross, I'm not here to sell you my stock. On the contrary, I'm here to buy yours.
Of course not.
It's a big house.
I don't know sometimes.
I feel great I got no sleep but I feel like Orlando Furioso!
You know. The finger.
I'm on their blacklist already, their roll of honor.
Two meters.
Two.
What business is you in, Jack? Just tell me what your business is...
It's not that hard to find it in there, Jack--it'll take you just a minute. You just gotta go fishin'.
That just ain't right, Jack--your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! That ain't right.
Of course there's worms, Homer! And what is them worms, really? They just protein , them worms! They is good for you!
What about the worms? Most of these apples are the drops--off the ground, right? There have to be worms.
Cider don't have no taste till later in October--it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early Macs and them Gravensteins. You don't get no good cider till you're pickin' them Golden Delicious and them Winter Bananas, them Baldwins and them Russerts...
Halt negotiations immediately. Envoy extraordinary arrives Thursday six ten with full power. Your authority cancelled herewith. Razinin.
A telegram from Moscow! It must have been here all day!
It is Thursday!
A Special Envoy is coming from Moscow. He'll occupy the Royal Suite. Move our things to the smallest room you've got.
Right away... instantly!
Namely?
He has his wife's jewelry hidden in among his clothes over there.
You sure it belongs to his wife?
That wasn't Mrs. Thorwald who left with him yesterday morning?
You figured that out, huh?
You scared?
My German's a little rusty.
Jim. What's yours?
What's your name!
Listen, I told you not to fool with them. Now they're waiting for you.
Plato. It's a nickname.
Then you'll understand my quest. An ogre named Blackheart has killed the last stag unicorn and stolen his horn. The world outside is cursed, plunged into eternal winter. Unless I return the alicorn, the earth will be frozen forever.
You don't ravage the countryside, devouring maidens and burning the crops?
East of Mercia?
Cathay?
Now, a clever man would put the poison into his own goblet, because he would know that only a great fool would reach for what he was given. I'm not a great fool, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But you must have known I was not a great fool; you would have counted on it, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
You've made your decision then7
Truly, you have a dizzying intellect.
It's terrible.
Uh-huh. And?
I pretty much knew what your answer was gonna be.
How old was she when this happened?
How long have you been into wine?
What was the bottle that did it?
Yeah, I know.
I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
There used to be three or four of those guys. Now we see 'em every time we come to the mall.
Burn the passport and keep the money. Think of it as a donation to the cause...
It will not happen!
Its powers are strong.
Good. They'll never catch him. There's not a mount in the kingdom can outrun a unicorn.
You're still angry, aren't you? Isn't it true that your whole story is nothing more than a vindictive attempt on your behalf to get back at Miss Lawson?
I suggest it never happened.
I guess.
Can we talk?
Don't ask, baby - huh! How much money you got with you?
Least she had time for me.
But who will they turn to for help?
Because I'd like to have dinner with you.
Call Cecile up and get her to come over. I'll bust that cherry in a heartbeat.
I now plan to devote all my energies to destroying the douche bag. Any luck corrupting her daughter?
What's your plan of attack?
Ooo, I'm sure Mrs. Caldwell will love that.
They don't break in the summer! Do you know what building is right over this spot? Harriman Tower. Their sub-basement was flooded! He didn't die in a pool. Call the coroner in Rhode Island! Ask if the water in his lungs was chlorinated!
No. No word.
No news yet?
Waiting -- I'm waiting for news from Manchester.
Have I kept you waiting?
I saw Gerstenkorn at lunch -- and as your lawyer I made it my business to broach the matter ---
I know -- I know.
Everything depends on the Manchester merger.
For me?
Or what? You'll wound me? I can blow you in half and you know it.
Right here. In the 7th Street subway station.
You're welcome. Sow how does it feel to...I know you gotta go -- Me too. We're very busy here.
...outlaw nation but strangely those who have interviewed Gaddafi find him, in a phrase we like to use in this country, very 'presidential'.
Me again. Hi. Listen Gaddafi doesn't foam at the mouth or anything. When you speak to him he's not at all nuts. He seems like a leader -- very impressive, self-control...that's what's so strange.
Nice, Jane.
No way. I'm so happy I'm about to bust. Here, honey. This is for you. It cost me my whole savings, but I said what the fuck.
Forget that. Come on. Got a little surprise...
We're not gonna be stationed anywhere, baby. I DORed.
That's right. Let's get married, Lynette. Let's find a justice of the peace and just do it!
I had to, baby... I'm no aviator. I was faking it, like I was with everything else in my life... up 'til right now.
Last word freak.
One-two-three, swing.
Thanks. May I offer you both a ride?
Boy, what'd I tell you about using that word?
They're all O.K. Mrs. Jorgensen, the boy, Dorothy, Macaulay... even Morelli... we had to let him go.
Like hell. You know, if you fellows stuck together 'stead of letting them walk all over you, they might not try it.
Sorry, honey, I...
Cause she had her hand on her gun the whole time, waiting to make her move.
I'm just saying she wasn't scared.
It's Richard Ripley.
Gimme another hint.
So I can have these?
Look, Toto! Before I kick your ass all the way to China and back, let's make a deal. These strips here are yours, I give them to you. However! One you're not to stick your nose in here any more. Two I'll keep them for you, because you can't take them home for God forbid and save our souls, if they catch fire, all hell will break loose! OK? Oh!!! And now scram!
I don't remember him any more Ma, where's Russia?
For about one year.
Intense.
It was wild. She was constantly trying to get me more and more worked up -- kinky things. I tried to satisfy her the best I could, but it was difficult in my condition.
I had a bad heart.
I had bypass surgery.
I don't think we've got any suitcases.
Saving a lady in distress, eh? Well, I suppose we all have dreams like that when we are young. Incidentally, we'd better get started. You'll have to pack.
Now you keep out of this!
Don't pay any attention to her.
This afternoon - at four o'clock.
When?
You're going to New York with us.
What for?
Look, it's not always luck, I mean, depending upon the placement of the numbers, a guy with 10 cards could win just as easily as a guy with 100.
Can we go yet?
You know I'm not allowed outside my myself after dark.
What's that?
Oh, Shortie!-- --there's a girl on this ship--
Yes. It's exactly...
I'm sorry! I said something wrong, didn't I! Please forgive me!
Wait! Please wait! I'll make a deal with you! I'll give you a Rogers Hornsby, if you'll take me to the hotel!
If it will make you feel any better, I don't have a gun.
Nope.
He's all yours. I was holding him back.
Jesus.
Your book. Your Herodotus! Alm sy looks uncomfortable.
I'm sorry - what have you noticed?
Let's make a little music, Colorada.
Later.
Easy, mon.
Uh-huh.
So, Dom tells me you're looking for some lady-friend you knew in high school.
She moved to Miami Beach twelve years ago. I checked directory assistance down there and she's not listed. She might've moved ten times since then.
Any idea where I might start looking?
It's okay... I've never been a detective before either...
I just sat and listened.
Would that make you any happier?
All right.
Let's turn on the radio.
It's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.
Why don't we make it three deputies and you?
Ya sister knows I'm comin'?
I'm sorry. Tanner, don't you want some wine?
Fine. I'm an insensitive, chauvinist asshole, and you're well rid of m...
What a sweet little picture. Mommy and Daddy aren't losing a daughter, they're gaining a eunuch!
Damn straight, it's how I feel! What's their wedding gift, a little gold collar that says "Mikey-poo"? Or do I have to change my name to "Binky"?
Morelli - You knew Julia. Was she gypping Wynant?
No problem. A little bullshit about Daddy's "needs," and presto, I'm a lap dog in high society.
Does it, really? How come you never took some sell-out establishment job? You had plenty of chances!
Thank you. Now I'll tell you why I know Wynant didn't commit those murders - Three months ago - the night that he caught you in Julia's apartment, he found out that Julia was cheating him, and was splitting with some man. He went to find the man. That man was.... Tanner, don't you...?
Yeah, sure -- She's very excited.
Lock the door.
But how am I going to get there?
Window.
Yes. Some nut who wanted to kill him. How is your father?
Probably not.
How did you ever remember me?
Not that scrawny little....?
Disappeared!
Show. Me. The. Money.
Yeah. You want a beer?
All right. I'll be in my workshop for a little while. I'll be in in a little while. I need to unwind a little. I'll be in soon. A little while.
Can we talk about this? Can you just try to calm down?
Hi.
Like it would make a difference if you were, right? This guy's a friend and now he's takin' ya out.
Why not?
No thanks.
I'm writing a book.
A detective. He falls for the wrong girl.
They fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after.
You bet.
The only time I can think of for sure, I was holding onto Sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.
You head was pressed against my chest. I could feel your heart racing. And I remember I kissed your hair.
What is it?
I don't know.
I'm gonna take a walk. I need some money.
You'll have money when you work.
You're so predictable.
Until two days ago all I really knew about Charles was his name -- now it turns out I didn't even know that.
Yes?
And, uh, d-don't forget the poem on page a hundred and twelve. It reminded me of you.
Miss Schuyler - I mean, Mrs. Smith - she engaged me this morning, sir.
Not yet.
About her upcoming wedding and all.
Hello. I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter. There was a sign at the hardware store across the street...
Oh? Anything else?
Oh no, sir!
I am just such a reporter. And you are?
Did you take anything out of those pants?
Dawson, huh? Was I very drunk last night?
Dawson, sir.
Yes. I must have been pretty much plastered if I hired a valet.
Whatever!
I don't have the money for those Bourgeois traps. Hell, I'm making what a Czech earns.
No, just crap. I want some picture frames.
It all comes down to ideology and they've lost theirs. If I'd been here ten years ago, maybe they wouldn't be in the mess they are today.
You should hope quite a while.
Let me handle this.
Thanks for showing me the bookstore. Perhaps you could, uh, take me to an AA meeting sometime. Uh...uh, I'd love to see what goes on.
Catch?
If he had a good breaking ball, I'd respect the shit outta him.
I was playing naked.
God I'm tired. What a trip I was lousy. I was worse than lousy. Everytime I pitched--it was like throwing gasoline on a fire. Kaboom. I--
I know, I know--I have that dream all the time. We're almost home.
Sorry. You look great. I'm totally exhausted.
Where can we meet?
You satisfied or you want more?
He did, huh. Well, tell Buddy I see Glenn wearing his sunglasses I'll step on 'em. I might not even take 'em off first.
What're you talking about?
I I was just on my way up, Johnny.
Glenn Michaels.
Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
Okay, let's see... you can have him on Tuesday the 25th...
Uh, let me get back to you...
You scheduled a whole day with the First Lady?
I never carry...baggage.
I know, you'll find me. Jesus, I believe it. I keep thinking if you hadn't driven me to federal court last summer, you wouldn't even know who I am.
What?
You re a nurse?
Something like that.
You were right. Del wasn't lying.
I think so too.
No, yes, it does...
No, for a candlelight dinner, yes, for her show.
Don't worry. I'll be on the train. He leaves.
How late?
By the way, shouldn't you have had a period by now?
Exactly how late are you, Lynette?
I must. I must
...Tight.
How ya feelin'?
Rocky, I'm seventy-six years old. Maybe you can be the winner I never was -- your shot is my last shot!
I asked, but ya never helped nothin'! -- Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
It's a comedy.
This can't be happening to me.
Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
Kat, stop it. You do. You can t even look me in the eye. You went back to the States when we split up.
You must, darling.
We did this before.
The porta power...comm kits...got the IR Thermo camera?
And you do it so well.
The key to success is using the right tools.
Had to get a liquid plasma screen.
Don't go getting sentimental. You're no damn good at it.
Tina was a wonderful woman.
Yeah, the lord of the manor doesn't haul his own groceries.
I'd give you a hand but it wouldn't look good.
Hello, Jimmy. What's up?
We're going to need a vacuum with a battery pack for the dust. The air filters might be wired. And a bypass hose for the AC.
You're not the one trying to get all this shit. You think they've just got a Crooks R Us on every corner?
You're welcome and, may I also say... heavenly.
Would you like something to nibble -- apricots, soaked in honey -- quite why, no one knows -- because it stops them tasting of apricots, and makes them taste like honey, and if you wanted honey, you'd just buy honey, instead of apricots, but nevertheless -- there we go -- yours if you want them.
Say, I saw where they had motor boats for rent down in the harbor. Why don't we all go for an evening cruise around the bay?
Two cents worth of shoelaces?
Guess I don't.
Thanks.
Name's Duff.
Now?
If you hadn't agreed--I was going to throw you overboard--
Hey.
Oh, hello.
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.
It's your play.
There's an old Fudgesicle over there. You want it?
And I have no idea why.
No, it doesn't. Now, remember: you never delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
For heaven's sake, why not?
But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
Now what do you say?
Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
Yeah, probably a good idea.
Okay, we're back in.
Well, thank you, Mary.
You get some sleep, Howard. I'll take it from here.
No. They're at the Franklin Hint Expo at the Skokie Holiday Inn.
And I think he was as much affected as I was at thus finding one of his kindred; for he, too, was an exile from home, and a friendly voice, a look, brought the old country back to his memory again, and the old days of his boyhood.
Wh--, uh, I know, I know but, I am in love with you.
I, I must apologize. I-I'm, I-I'm sorry. I'm so mixed up.
I-I, I'm sorry. I know it's terrible.
Like it?
Downstairs.
Twenty years, Ma ...
Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
Hi.
Find the Frenchman. Find me Mayol.
Their tiger-style kung-fu is strong; but our dragon style will defeat it!
Separately, we are flawed and vulnerable. But together, we are the masters of our sexual destiny!
No, a pact. No money involved. This is more important than any bet. Now here's the deal: We all get laid before we graduate.
Like a bet?
How you doin', brother?
Is Alyssa home?
Oh...do you know when she'll be home?
You can't promise me anything! You don't have anything to promise! You live in a garage! You don't have cable! You're not hooked up to the internet because you don't even own a computer! You don't have a job!
You'll have money when you work for it.
If you had a stupid phone or I could use your truck, mom would give me some money.
Just a second -- he has to go.
Yes... well, there's one more stage -- trying to figure out if it's any good.
Oh...okay.
Hello. Hi. Hi.
I don't want courage. I don't want to be a warrior. All I've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!
What a great son you are, Ranon. I wish I could take you with me. Now go to sleep...
Daikinis are giant people who live far far away.
The cabinets have to be redone --
Very serious?
No I don't.
I've been buying you stuff all week. I've been buying him stuff all week.
When we went to the Hard Rock Cafe. Who paid? When we went to see 'Cats'. Who paid?
I paid for those guitar cases.
Why--I--er thought with all this heat turned on I'd hide it.
No, I've never played anything cool in my entire life. Spike, who I'll stab to death later, never gave me the message.
By all means, knock yourself out.
We made it, didn't we?
I'm sorry. I don't understand.
Yeah. It wasn't Tom.
I am committed. I love you.
I don't want that. I want to be with you.
Debbie, I'm telling you, I didn't do anything, hardly.
Do you think the boy you saved might identify your husband as his purchaser, Deborah? And then, your brother s not buried yet. As I said earlier, an autopsy will...
You don't believe me? Okay, fine.
There's something I've been meaning to tell you, Heather.
It's gonna sound really bad, but I want you to know.
No, that's not what I mean. I mean -- look. You know what made me leave that game? Coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.
No, see Heather, what I realized is that...with you, it's not like I'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. And this may sound corny, but --
I think the photographer's probably a voyeur.
Because, I'm your attorney. I shouldn't be going to your house.
Okay, Bone-Setter Brown goes. Here, sign it. Meanwhile, here's fifty dollars for spending money. That's fine. Beany!
We're eight and sixteen.
It works. You should try it sometime.
Well as a matter of --
We move to sunny L.A. All of show business is out there, Max.
No, I cannot. You keep bringing it up, but I don't wanna live in a city where the only cultural advantage is that you can make a right turn on a red light.
I don't think so.
The teleprompter. Is it hooked up?
What?
A teleprompter.
Now some of this may feel a bit Strange at first. You gotta remember that even a professional Politician has Some trouble getting used to...
Great.
First thing we're gonna work on is the mannerisms. Alan has put together sort of a training program
He didn't tell you to cut all your hair off...!
Oh.
Did I say something wrong?
You never know. Lightning could strike.
I would.
I know what you're saying. Doesn't pay very well. Depends on the woman I marry. Maybe she'd like a bigger house, a better car, lotsa kids, college doesn't come cheap --
Well there's a couple --
I've been thinking... I don't want you to be my doctor. Because I don't want you to examine me.
That's right.
Yeah, see you in hell.
Hell, baby, I bet you think we got tails.
Having it cleaned didn't help, huh?
I don't understand.
-- What's the deal here? Are you going to be breathing down my neck right 'til the very end?
Well said, Eddie. Mr. Black, shall we?
Are you sad, Bill?
...I'd like to be alone for a while.
Yeah, two things Pete, that --
I'm on my way to Chicago. Very important meeting tonight. Well -- any new developments?
We think this party might cheer her up. Just make sure you know what's expected of you.
Charles, in spite of your adolescent infatuation with music, we've always regarded you a a fine young man. We've trusted you with our daughter.
Yes, sir. Trust is a two way street. In the past two years I've been pleased to note that you and Mrs. Kelcher have, uh, fulfilled your sacred trust of being good parents to the, uh, woman I plan to take off your hands.
Inflamed joints -- Walkin' in an' out of a freezer carryin' meat plays hell on the joints.
What did you do?
Oh that's no problem. -- take care of this boy's problem, will you, Gene?
-- oh no, honey, I'll do that...
Brilliant.
It was bad.
The girl with the purple fingernails was Coogan's sister.
Lower.
He probably gave 'em an argument.
No doubt the man's got some big-ass security system.
No.
She wiped out her whole family.
Didn't you study it in school?
Jesus, look at that wall. Place almost looks like a prison.
I didn't.
I wake up at night seeing him fall from the roof... and try to reach out for him.
I had to quit, Midge.
I know. I have Acrophobia. What a disease. A fear of heights. And what a moment to find out I had it.
Maybe you shouldn't come everyday.
You just do your job, Shermin. We'll make the policy.
Love is funny.
Thank you, Sir.
Me, I'm kinda aggravated.
What's that for?
Who was it answered the phone?
Jesus.
I don't know what you're talking about, Howard.
Mary has stolen our files and is sending them back to people.
Hi, it's Joel.
Don't ask me.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what I think?
You know who this is?
It's all right. It just grazed me.
Now that's a really big house.
Look at my hands -- See how the joints are swollen.
At least.
My love... because I love you.
No... we're together...
Your fond wishes give me strength, dear friends.
Then stand there an' wait till I'm done -- Creed's good, yeah, he's real fine but I gotta boy, y'know Big Dipper, who's got the stuff it takes to be a champ -- He's mean, quick, an' big -- What more d'ya need? Okay, go to work... Hey -- Yeah -- Whatta ya want?
Her favorite pastimes were riding her horse and tormenting the farm boy that worked there. His name was Westley, but she never called him that. Isn't that a wonderful beginning?
If you had your way I wouldn't have any friends.
I'll be able to keep my apartment and studio, won't I?... Just tell me.
Well, I can't reach them.
Terrify me?
Sorry. What are those cards?
Sounds swell... I'm really touched. And my getting married's not gonna change a thing between me and my pals. We're still gonna go bowling on Tuesdays, play cards on Fridays and wear women's clothes on Sunday night. I love you guys... I always will.
Yeah. Right. All the things that make life worth living.
Because I love her. What can I tell you?
Ask them what the candles are for.
You ask them.
Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
Right.
Wrong.
No... It depends... Sometimes they are... What, exactly do you want to know?
"Fight over tuna casserole may have spurred slaying." Seems this woman's live-in boyfriend, seventy years old, complained about her tuna noodle casserole and she shot him in the face with a twelve-gauge. Police found noodles in the woman's hair and think the guy dumped the casserole dish on her before she shot him. They'd been together ten years.
Aren't you worried that people will cut their feet?
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
Clementine.
What are you doing?
Female.
I don't know. I think it's the moon.
Where's your car? I'll walk you to it.
I'm no suggesting the worst will happen...but someone with your brilliance gets nibbles about other jobs and maybe, the next time that happens, down the road -- you should look into it.
Of course, sir. That explains it. Leather is a very good source of vitamin E.
Time flies, huh?
Two hours ago!
Please. Talk to me --
Where are you? Are you there?
They stopped serving two hours ago.
Half-hour. Once I finish this octave I'm gonna get breakfast. You see what's on the buffet?
Aaron, I've never seen them like this -- I think Paul's nervous about his own job and for some reason he thinks you only appeal to...
Well, stop it. You know what I want to hear.
No, I don't.
I bet they're asleep in New York. I'll bet they're asleep all over America.
What's that you're playing?
Just a little something of my own.
They grab Ugarte and she walks in. Well, that's the way it goes. One in, one out. Sam?
Yeah, boss?
Sam, if it's December 1941 in Casablanca, what time is it in New York?
Uh, my watch stopped.
I can't really. Yeah, no. I mean. I can't afford it.
Yes, no, yes. I can't. I can't afford that. I'm sorry. Sorry.
No.
Just till I lose.
Again?
The Medical Examiner seems to think that the body was touched. He says it looks as if the girl's hand had been forced open after she was killed....
Move! Or you die right here!
Yes! I was paid! But the
Say, what kind of rifle was that you were shooting at me?
Go on, hit me.
What makes you think you're so almighty? Telling people what to do and how to act when you don't even know how yourself.
Kind of feeling your oats this morning. I haven't laid a hand on you for quite a while, but that doesn't mean you're too old.
I'll eat when I'm good and ready.
Come on. We got a couple hours to eat and get some sleep.
That ain't why. I just figure it's about time to start runnin' my own life.
You oughta say you're sorry -- that's what you oughta do.
Sit down and eat. Till I say the word, you're doing what you're told.
Sure have, Sam.
We saw his show at the Luxor last night.
Very talented son of a bitch. Too bad we can't kill him.
The kid's got talent. You've never seen Malkovich like this. Schwartz had him up there singing and dancing. Impressions.
A scary dream?
All right. She smiles back.
Got to, Sam. You and I are going to a courthouse together, put some people behind bars.
Now, just have a little patience, my boy. Your birthday isn't until next week.
Nobody? Huh!... How come?
Ha-ha... Yeah... What about that road back there, though? It says closed to the public , doesn t it?
Perhaps an arrangement can be reached.
-- there's nothing to explain. You're trying to kidnap what I've rightfully stolen. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 43.
You know how much higher the play level is in the NBA? Give yourself time to develop, Quincy. Get an education. The NBA ain't going nowhere.
You came out early.
Bad experiences.
What?
Besides, the sooner you go pro, the sooner you'll have to deal with the mess I'm dealing with.
What mess?
Naturally, you must expect me to attack with Capo Ferro.
Careful, lad.
Damn them!
Which way did he go?
And that would ruin your reputation how?
This is your great invention? Would you wear those things?
Pick up a burger for Fred. He's going crazy.
You... ...fell into the Bay.
I saw that in a nickelodeon once, and I always wanted to do it.
About what?
Are yuh?
C-c-coll- College audiences are so wonderful.
You're so sure about it.
I'm here!
And what do you know? You tell me my life? I'll tell you yours. I'm a wolf? You run to the wolf in me, that don't make you no lamb! You're gonna marry my brother? Why you wanna sell your life short? Playing it safe is just about the most dangerous thing a woman like you could do. You waited for the right man the first time, why didn't you wait for the right man again?
Do you dance?
They guys treatin' you all right?
Pretty bad.
I've been doing a lot of thinking.
With the reading comprehension of a fifteen year old! Plus, I'm popular... You want to be popular... I can recognize a cry for help when I see one.
This is it Jos! This is my ninth inning! The game isn't over--I just thought it was! I get on the Southglen baseball team, the right scout sees me-- I'm into the minors- it's game time!
You must admit that this doomed old civilization sparkles... It glitters!
Yes, very strange.
And thank you for getting me up here. I've never seen this before. Beautiful, isn't it?
I'm glad I saw it before becoming extinct.
Yeah.
A little. Yes. You have to wonder.
Yes?
Are you willing to follow all His commandments?
I'll call you back.
Nah, I don't know.
Okay, There's more, Stan --
Mary hates me. I've never been popular with the ladies.
Maybe if you stopped stealing their panties.
We haven't checked.
This is the hotel San Domenico?
No, no!
And yet you started the engine right up. With all those lights drawing all night, the batteries had that much charge. Did that strike you odd?
I think you testified all the lights were on. Cabin, mast, net lights, picking lights...
Cause you got a little voice in your head saying, do the right thing. Give him another chance.
She likes you, man. Stephanie'll tell you.
Nope.
I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.
What?
Hi.
You know, with Ray...
Oh? And just because you realize now, everybody else should forgive you?!
That's too easy. One minute you want to die, the next you want to live... Do you think that life is a toy that can be played with and then broken when you don't want it anymore?
How can you pretend that you love God when you're about to throw away the most precious thing he gave you? Life is a gift, you should know that by now Jeanne -- a gift from God. You know what He'd say to you, if He was here? "What are you doing to me, Jeanne?"
If you were true to yourself... if your faith was firm, you wouldn't need to run away from yourself like this...
Oh, so you don't want war anymore? You want to be at peace? You want to be able to change your mind anytime you feel like it and expect everyone to go along with it?
The way you talk. Never heard a Woman talk like that.
You mean Behan? Then why are you with him?
Yeah, maybe...
One thing puzzles my mind, sugar... You're twenty years old - aren't you ever curious why your mama has this fixation on keepin' us apart? Puttin' a detective on us. I'll tell ya Lula... Well... It's more'n me killin' Bob Ray Lemon...
A wolf.
It was a wolf.
It wasn't a lunatic.
Now we've just given you a pretty strong sedative, so try to get some rest now. Miss Price will see to your needs. Rest now.
Lunatic?
You've suffered some rather severe cuts and bruises, lost a bit of blood, but nothing too serious; black and blue for a while. You'll have some dueling scars to boast of. That lunatic must have been a very fierce fellow. They say a mad man has the strength of ten.
No.
I've got heads here, Norman.
Work that jab, work that hook, work that jab, okay, take a break, take a break.
Mr. Shakespeare has given me the part of the Apothecary!
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theatre you must have a part in my play. I am writing an Apothecary, a small but vital role.
By heaven, I thank you! I will be your Apothecary!
The Apothecary? Will, what is the story? Where is the shipwreck? How does the comedy end?
By God, I wish I knew.
Here -- here it is. Here's your pocketbook, Kringelein.
Oh -- yes -- that's it -- you found it -- you found it for me, Baron.
Goodnight, Kringelein.
No -- no please -- oh, don't go -- don't go -- don't leave me alone, Baron.
You've nothing to fear, Kringelein
No.
You're all right now -- it's very late -- goodnight, Kringelein.
Oh, no, stay here, Baron -- stay.
A block of ice.
Since when is faro a business?
Pink for flower.
Sheriff Behan, Doc Holliday.
Forgive me if I don't shake hands.
None of your business.
She says she'll be here tomorrow...!
Do me a favor -- Talk to Gazzo. Tell him I'm a friend an' would do a good job... Tell him I ain't bothered by nothin' an' would be a great collector... Bustin' bones don't bother me -- Tell him I'm a good worker.
Beer please! Do you want another drink?
That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
Why, yes. Thank you.
It is my only object.
What? Is that what you're calling me about?
Now. What is it you wanted to tell me?
There was a Buddy Bragg at Lompoc around the same time Foley was there. We got an address for him at the Adams Hotel in Hallandale. I want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy. If he does, you call me right away...
Yeah, sure, Karen. You bring in Chirino, you can be on the task force.
You're right. You better hope so.
Your cousins go out with him.
My mare is saddled and ready; who's the captain's second?
And now you risk the same fate. If you are killed, your mother is all alone in the world.
I am Harry James' son, and will act as becomes my name and quality.
That's a very handsome sword you have there.
It was with this sword that my late father, Harry James, God rest his soul, met Sir Huddelstone Fuddelstone, the Hampshire baronet, and was fatally run through the neck. He was quite in the wrong, having insulted Lady Fuddelstone, when in liquor, at the Brentford Assembly. But, like a gentleman, he scorned to apologize.
I hope to spoil this sport, and trust to see this sword of mine in that big bully's body.
Oh, it's with pistols we fight. You are no match for Best with the sword.
I've been doing some thinking. It's my last school year. I'm a single, successful guy. I think I want my freedom.
Don't worry about it. Who sent the flowers?
I don't care it you tell me or not. I got problems of my own.
Are you kidding? Work is great. I kill at work. I don't even mind Mom and Dad making me pay rent.
All right then! Yes!
Elaine -- I love you.
What?
Did you say rape her?
About three hours.
Women! Ever heard of 'em?
Oh.
Your uncle had a weakness for dark ones, tall and stately. How would you like yours? Dark or fair, tall or short, fat or thin, tough or tender?
What're you talking about?
Okay, you're the boss. When your blood begins to boil, yell out. I'll be seeing you!
He talks about women as if they were cattle.
Name your poison and I'll supply it.
Some other time, Cobb. Some other time.
Every man to his taste, sir.
I don't want to go to Siberia.
Where is your courage, Comrade Buljanoff?
If Lenin were alive he would say, "Buljanoff, Comrade, for once in your life you're in Paris. Don't be a fool. Go in there and ring three times."
I don't want to go to the Hotel Terminus.
Which would you prefer?
Looks like the only one who got screwed here was you.
This is it I guess.
Okay...take your time...I'll...I'll go for a walk around.
You want me to come with?
Guy paints a beautiful picture.
Who do I have to fuck to get off this planet?
Nothing! They can do nothing! Gentlemen!
You're out numbered son.
I'm sorry, I can't do that. I don't have the time. Goodbye
Could I have one of those Chesterfields now?
We're not doing it! I'm not even sure it's Christian.
Well, I don't care if it's legal or not, we're not cremating her and throwing her all over some bridge where we can't even go visit her because she's going to be blown all over the place like an ashtray.
And your own gas cooker? That's marvelous! Naturally it's not the Royal Suite...
Yes, there's no doubt of that... Just look out of the window and there it is.
She's right... anyhow let's talk ourselves into it.
Just see how happy the people look... from here....
Can you blame them?... at least the May Day parade is over.
That's another thing... it's spring.
Even the swallows are back.
Oh, don't bother. I got one. So you're a Sicilian, huh?
You re sure he said his caller was a man?
You got no idea...
Your what...?
What are you talking about?
Get in bed.
You got a great ass! I love your ass -- now get that falling ass into bed before it hits the floor.
Is there any more to it?
Right. Seven. Christ, that s a long time, isn t it?
Well, we had a lot of good years, but then...
It s not supposed to be anything, Kat. It s just my rather feeble attempt to.... Oh, I don t know. You see, I thought I could deny my feelings--
Me neither.
How long have I been here?
I don't know. I'll go and sort it out today. Why don't you come?... We'll find a real room for me. You can pick it out, a tower on the strip.
What do you mean?
Sera...
Wow.
Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
It still strikes me as, well, surreal, that I'm allowed to see you naked.
Okay -- okay. Might be too late, but okay.
No! No. Wait. I... thought you were someone else. I thought you were Spike. I'm delighted you're not.
And you can depend on me, son. Trust me. Whatever comes we'll face it together, I swear.
Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
He depended on me.
What needs sorting out?
Can I help you?
Yeah...
I will not accept this! Now go away!
The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
You must believe me.
I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
Don't hit me, now, don't hit me!
Not half as bad as I feel.
Don't touch me!
So he can tell the story.
If that ring checks out, we'll give him an escort. So long.
Just don't dally. Thorwald knows he's being watched. He won't hang around long.
Wyatt Earp is my friend.
Maybe you won't need it. I'll run it down, Jeff.
G'night.
Please, have a seat.
We all have to like what we become. Cowards included. We achieve this by complicating things a little. But it s never that complicated really.
I'll tell you...the guy...with...just talk to me later about it, ok?
What nurses?
So-so, Johnny.
It's fine. It was fun, though.
Sure. If you like.
They didn't teach you that in finishing school? Here, it's easy. Watch closely.
Yeah; it was great money... I could make a dollar a day, sometimes. But only in summer. When it got cold, I decided to go to Paris and see what the real artists were doing.
Alright, we're going. We'll drink cheap beer and go on the rollercoaster until we throw up and we'll ride horses on the beach... right in the surf... but you have to ride like a cowboy, none of that side-saddle stuff.
Lily!
El? I'm sorry. I do love you. And you are a lady. I have so much respect...
Goodbye...
Will you come with me?
It could have been marvelous ...
I just don't have anything very interesting about my life.
Oh, I doubt that's the case.
Definitely!
Yup.
Yup.
No, it isn't that.
Uh-uh. The dog. I think I know now why Thorwald killed it.
He is --
Chicken?
I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking. They make mush out of him. Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him.
How can anyone grow up in this circus?
I bet you see right through me, don't you?
Pretty mixed up?
A zoo. He always wants to be my pal, you know? But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die.
"If he could" what? You mean your father?
If he could--
Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place.
You got me, Jim--but they do. Want some water?
All right, I will. Here's looking at you, kid.
All except one. He won't have you.
I don't know anything about her. What if she's some sort of witch or something?
I gotta know the truth, Kevin.
Oh. Huh. Well, look, I got this file I need valued. Real estate thing. A lady has some property next to a PG E plant that PG E wants to buy. I need to know what to ask for it.
The extortion, the threats ...
And look here. Cease fire in Chechenia. That's good for the banks who lent the government money, but bad for the guys selling them weapons. Listen to this, some gas company in Colorado. Their researchers have been blocked from testing a fuel additive. They've accused the E.P.A. of, quote, 'turning a blind eye to the future.'
I'm going to throw out these old videos.
No. You can't bin these. They're classics. I'm not allowing this.
My God, it better be, darlin', cause it'd be the last... What time is it?
Huh?
You got me, peanut.
Even though I left, you never left me. Not just memory but a substance in my blood.
Too junky-kitschy. Deeper, deeper.
You talking to me?
snow shovel or anything or something.
Well, I think I ve got a handle on the Czech pysche and I reckon this kind of joint will make em reminisce about the sixties. Plus we should get a few stray expat s looking for Kafka.
Very big spider.
Darling, darling, I've been killing spiders since I was thirty, okay?
For real?
So...does it hurt?
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
Lobby. We haven't got all day.
That reminds me, Mr. Mu... uh, Sid. I never did give you that--
Roast tom turkey. Gee, I'm hungry too --
Excuse me. Mr. McQuire.
Oh no. He said that.
Where did he do it?
How did he do it? Did he get down on his knees? He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.
Well, what did he say? I'm curious.
The pleasure is mine, madame.
And I am M'sieu Laval--if you will allow me to introduce myself.
Are we getting married tomorrow?
Please, Madame Colet, I believe in doing things correctly. Shall we continue? Two hairpins, one cigarette lighter, one box of real matches, and-- Oh, yes, this letter from Major--
That's precisely what scaresme--that they won't do anything foolish or courageous or anything--worth a Goddamn.
I'll decide when it's exaggerated.
Probably the bathroom.
I ordered it. It's for your own safety.
Aye. But there are Fenians reported on the mainland.
You're primary, you're secondary, you're point man.
You get the key?
Yeah, why?
How beautiful.
What's your problem? I'm doing the job.
I'm a thief. Sue me.
You hate me don't you?
He's taking a nap.
It's not just a gag, huh?
Oh, yes. Yes, I will.
Why not? Who is he?
Of course, Elaine. But as long as there's any question, better Johnny should come back and clear his name.
Okay, seeya.
I do, she's real funny.
Why is that childish? Your living with the guy! I'm just asking how it's going.
You can come to my house for dinner?
Oh man, I'm gonna enjoy this one... Just remember, Jack, you did this. You brought this on yourself...
You still think this is about me, don't you?
Sure it's about you. But it's about society, too.
Honestly! You cut me to the core! What's the point of all your valiant attempts at rehabilitation if -- when I finally succumb -- when at long last, I pledge myself to righteous conduct -- you regard me with nothing but suspicion? Have you no faith in your own medicine?
I'm not afraid of her.
Why the hell not?
He's an undertaker.
You oughta use a rubber, pop. You really should.
Out front.
Let me have the keys.
Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building. Donut said something about a news van.
Mickey, can I talk to you alone?
No.
Ah, Dick, let's talk about it in the car. We can't be late.
Clarence.
Yeah?
I got the part on "T.J. Hooker".
They didn't even want a callback. They just hired me like that. Me and Peter Breck are the two heavies. We start shooting Monday. My call is for seven o'clock in the morning.
No, I'm not. We were walking off the tennis court, and you know, he was there and me and his wife, and he looked at her and then they both looked at me, and under his breath he said, "Jew."
You're crazy!
I distinctly heard it. He muttered under his breath, "Jew."
Wh- How am I a paran-? Well, I pick up on those kind o' things. You know, I was having lunch with some guys from NBC, so I said... uh, "Did you eat yet or what?" and Tom Christie said, "No, didchoo?" Not, did you, didchoo eat? Jew? No, not did you eat, but Jew eat? Jew. You get it? Jew eat?
Alvy, you're a total paranoid.
Yeah. What's Buddy-boy done for us lately?
Why not? We don't owe Buddy-boy anything.
I see. What do you think, Al? Can we help the man?
Okay. Let's... Okay. Okay. You have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? For money. To make money.
And. It's wrong.
And that would be Morals. That would be one's own moral sense of decency.
So. What then? You just detach sex from everything..
Listen. I didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.
Well, thanks. We'll call you when we need you again.
That's a bet--but I couldn't let you walk out like that, Sally. I'd have gone cuckoo back there--just thinking about you--
Open it up.
That's right. When I was your age, television was called books. And this is a special book. It was the book my father used to read to me when I was sick, and I used to read it to your father. And today, I'm gonna read it to you.
I brought you a special present.
... just, you could look very heavy...
Aye, ma'am.
No! But you keep asking these, these awful questions. My God, it's-it's like you want me to say yes!
What kind of interrogation... Su- supposing I said yes? I-I-I am disenchanted. I am in love with someone else.
Last spring I happened to walk past a house that I had once patronized. There was a cool breeze blowing off the ocean and through the window I could see a bare leg. The girl must have been taking a break between customers. It was a strange moment for me because it reminded me of my mother and despite the fact that I was late for something already I just stayed there, loving the atmosphere of it and my memory and... the reason I'm telling you this epilogue is that I felt that I'd come full circle.
Yeah... I'd like that.
You be careful to. I'm going to miss you.
Maybe I should follow you around and ask one of your tricks what it's like to sleep with you.
Your father?
Somethin' was upsettin' you bad last night, and you wanted to tell me and I figured you wanted to tell me so's I could help...
Just some guys I met here... I keep seein' 'em... Now tell me...
Save your mischief for the Black Baron.
You'll need more than bird droppings for Blackheart.
Drop a mountain on him and we won't need our troops.
Fine-looking army.
We march on Castle Couer de Noir within the hour.
How do you plan on finding this here castle, if ye don't mind me asking?
A true and troubling question, Gump... We'll start from where the unicorn was killed. The Baron must have left a trail.
Track the demon to his lair.
But I promised Jeanne we'd fight on!
After everything he did to you and your mom?
I think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.
I would have killed him.
Everything would have been better if you had. You'd have liked your grandmother. And there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. I remember reading about her in the paper. They couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. I still feel guilty about that.
Do you ever wish you had done it?
I was just thinking about my mom. She wouldn't leave him. I remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. I mean it was dark outside and in. But we never talked about it.
Sun glasses?
No.
I myself --
You know Diane Court?
Maude, please. Don't die. I couldn't bear it. Please, don't die.
Farewell?
... which I hope will make you very happy.
But you're not going anywhere, are you?
-- you could have the stamps. I'll get you some here, okay?
Don't you want me to stay?
Is there only one Charles Lampert?
Charles is.
Are you in the book?
Uh-huh.
I'm thinking it's time to settle down. One woman. One house. You know. It's time.
You know what I'm thinking?
Sure I'm sure. And just what are you implying? I'm really pissed off at you about all this, if you want to know the truth. What's Maya going to think of me now just for associating with you? You're the one who's sabotaging me, not the other way around, pal. Not by a longshot.
You sure you didn't say anything to Maya?
What's it look like to you?
It's Mr. Buddy Felton?
We're very specialized.
Only on the football field.
That's the book Hinkley had on him when he shot Reagan.
Re-educating trained killers in the ways of polite society. Making sure the men who've gone over the edge won't hurt anyone. That sort of thing.
What... Some kind of organ factory... Pregnant girls doped up. Babies. There s a lot of people back there. They re holding a seminar. Trafficking s the past, breeding the future...
Some Italian I picked up back there. He s in the boot of the Mustang.
Who s the guy? Who s the guy! Nom de Dieu! Had the guy got a closer look at you or your number plate I d have had to kill him.
Thank you.
No, Lisa -- I don't think he did.
Who knows. Who cares... You wanted slime. You got slime.
Well, -- if there was one less thread this way -- -- and two less that way -- -- I might give up bachelorhood.
Just that she got away.
All right, I'll see you, Thomas, because he wants an answer by Monday.
Sure.
I ve got all the time in the world...
Hey, what's up.
TilT we figure something out.
I thought we had separate rooms.
We do. She's got hers, we've got ours. Hey. Wash and Dries.
Not at all, sir.
You want to eat something?
No.
Extend them. C'mere for a second.
What?
I came here from a long distance to stay at the Grand Hotel. I want a room -- a big room -- like you would give General Director Preysing -- I'm as good as Mr. Preysing -- I can pay like Mr. Preysing -- would you give him a little room, way up in the corner with the hot water pipes going -- bang -- bang -- bang...
This gentleman can have my room.
Oh!
Send his bags up to my room.
I certainly have a complaint -- and a fair one.
Oh -- but -- I --
You're tired. I can see that.
The short one with black hair is your cousin Irene --
Ma'am.
You're damn right! Jesus! Peggy! You sure know how to spoil a mood.
Yeah, sorry about that. I had this meeting with this guy.
Hey, I tried to get her off the phone.
Gee, this is great.
I don't know, kill herself. She's O.D.'d four times.
I thought we all had separate rooms.
... yeah.
I don t know! Please stop yelling at me!
There's one way to find out.
No, but I think I do.
No.
No, I see Betty as a Midwestern Stoic type. Ice water in her veins. A clear thinker. Probably a Swede or a Finn.
A 'Finn?' What is a Finn?
You should read more. Listen to me. I think this woman was waiting for a chance to do this, and we gave it to her. She kept to herself for years, living with a pompous asshole. Then she sees her opportunity, and BOOM! -- she leaves that little mudpatch in the dust. These heartlanders can't figure it out, 'cause that's not their sweet little Betty. Hah! We've been tracking her for, what, three days and I already understand her better'n most the people in that shitty little burg.
I'd say that about torches her credibility, wouldn't you?
Yeah, well, if the wife's trying to sell it she'll fuck up. She's an amateur, just like Del was.
Betty, Betty, Betty...
So what the fuck's a Finn?
No jewelry! Hands off jewelry! If we're broke--all right. I might pick up a million-franc necklace. But in times like these when we're doing a cash business--why take a chance on jewelry?
--the other half, contrary to custom, shall be delivered in cash into Madame's personal custody. Darling, that means that on the second of June we'll have eight hundred and fifty thousand francs.
I give you my word! They were confiscated legally!
It's horrible. Terrence was one of the most brilliant men I've known.
Yeah, well, why did he hang out here? The cops said it's dangerous -
I know. I'm Andy McDermott. Terrence's nephew.
I'm sorry my friend, I'm not signing books right now. There's been a tragedy.
Why can't you just tell me?
Naah, I think you'd better stay here and keep Grammoo company.
She likes to play bingo.
Well Shelly's coming over, we're gonna go together.
Ahh, I just wanna look nice.
I guess I have a more optimistic view of human nature than you do.
Right -- let's talk about rent...
Mr. Gower, I won't ever tell anyone. I know what you're feeling. I won't ever tell a soul. Hope to die, I won't.
Don't hurt my ear again!
I know where everything is.
Except the goddamn skateboards, which are everywhere! I'd like to kill the guy who invented those things.
Lay back, Mack.
Lay back, Mack!! What's this "lay back, Mack?" Where does he get this?
Keep what handy?
The gun? It's in the upstairs closet.
How do you know where the gun is?
You know, Monsieur Mercier, this is all non-sense.
God! Scrambled eggs surprise?! These are pickles...! God!
Speaking of misery, Miss Lonely Hearts drank herself to sleep again. Alone.
She's real eat, drink and be merry girl.
Well, the salesman could be available soon.
And some man will lose his.
It's hard to figure. He went out several time last night, in the rain carrying his sample case.
But you're the one who wanted to wait till we got married. And you were right. We should wait.
You came up here looking for the portal?
Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom...
Well, that's what I knew then. Or who I knew, I should say. You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom. I went to the meeting to impress her.
Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl?
Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college. I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for?
Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive...
All right, Mr. Appleton. That was what you knew then. What do you know now?
How, Dick? The way you earned it? By marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? What is this Knute Rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? Back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. You were a goddamn dumpling. Maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. Till you were nothing. I saved your ass. So you'll pardon me if I don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there." Okay, Dick? I can't do it.
Today, I'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage. You think you're better than that? Fine. Show me. Show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. A lot better. But first, Jack, you gotta earn it.
You're a fucking alarm clock.
All right, all right. I'm a little tense.
Sorry, I'm so late. Lester just wouldn't let me go. We re supposed to have dinner with him on Friday. I can get us out of it if you want. He's really amazing, this insane old lech. It's actually sort of amusing when you get past just how disgusting it is.
...I guess it's...just a matter of personal taste.
Is this about Sarah Lawrence? You punishing me?
Joanne Braslow is getting more and more interesting. I followed her today to an attorney's office. Joseph Koehler.
What happened next?
What happened?
What did he say?
Yes--Filiba! Venice--Grand Hotel-- room two fifty-three--
In a moment.
Sometimes you can't learn everything from a screen..sometimes it's better to ask someone who has experience..
I want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.
No you don't.
Yes! But "love" isn't the operative word here, PEACE is!
Not hard to find you...just follow the Chaos...
When you study the martial arts, they give out belts that come in different colors to signify what level you're at in your training. Am I correct on that point?
More or less...
There's a whole wing in this house.
Well, I flew in the war, but that was a long time ago. I wouldn't know anything about it.
Trigger.
The cockpit? What is it?
This must have been in the family a long time.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
Pleased to meet you, ma'am. We found your trunk. Were you doin' the driven'?
Yes, ma'am.
An alternative literary venue!
No, it's the whole idea behind it. How did they get this place?
This place is getting expensive too, used to be twelve.
Right and not just the bar, Lubosh and his mates took the whole freakin' building.
What'd I tell you? It doesn't catch fire!
I don't.
Oh, we got plenny-a room here.
Yes it does.
Their faces are familiar--but not to each other.
And the murderer is right here in this room tonight... he's sitting at this table. You may serve the fish.
Then don't.
So I did. I saw him lying buried in his shop.
You mean that body-----?
Because I don't have the right name?!
Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself. As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it.
Yes.
No. Nothing bad's going to happen. Anne'll be there. I'll be there. Nothing bad will happen.
No--not quite.
I'm still scared.
...I feel so much for her...I feel like something awful is going to happen.
Neosporin?
No,... like a worthy adversary, Wesley. Like a very worthy adversary.
Like... us?
I haven't had --
Yeah. To see if he could expedite my case. But I wait, and I wait, and...I'm starting to think I'll never see her again.
Now will you get in the flask?
Maybe we ought to hire a bodyguard from now on.
Did ya ever see "The Chinese Professionals"?
Blood . . . my . . . blood . . .
Surely --
What I do, I do for my Queen.
The look on their faces when one walks into the room. Still gives one a ridiculous thrill.
I wouldn't know.
Then I envy yo.
Why?
Was there never ambition?
How 'bout the score was his idea to begin with?
No way.
Don't worry, I'm a new strain. And I don't give up. Everything I've ever wanted I've had to work like hell for. Well, how about it?
What if he's not?
I'm not your foe. CHARLIE And if he's harmless, you disengage.
What are you talking about?
No You mean...?
Well think about it.
The lazy fuck just didn't bother to look her up.
Uh-huh.
Well then you've got to call her, man.
That sneaky prick was probably practicing his jai alai.
Fuck calling her. I'm going down there.
What's it doing on a rifle range?
That so?
She put it even at three to three, so as the Mayor I get to cast the tiebreaker. The older generation won't have any problem with it. They remember how Buddy come to be Sheriff, that it was all 'cause he took their part.
Hell, everybody heard that story a million times.
--Santiago.
Right. But nobody here ever noticed him till they read his name on the national news--
That's not the whole story. The Mexicans that know, that remember, understand what Buddy was for their people. Hell, it was Mercedes over there who swung the deciding vote for him.
No, no, no... you don't know shit about procedure! You don't send your best...
If you wanted to call me back I could...
What kind of photographs?
Yeah, I was drinking.
A couple days ago.
What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
No.
What's on your mind?
Cause I'm a guy that don't believe in hoggin' it, see? A bird that figures that way winds up behind the eight ball, is what I always say.
What?
It's a lotta dough. If I was to run across that dame, you know what I'd do?
I'd go fifty-fifty with you .
That's right.
If you wanna get anywhere nowadays, you gotta keep in touch with all the news, is what I always say.
Yeah wouldn't it?
Take that story there, for instance. Be kinda sweet if we could collect that ten thousand smackers.
....I'm not exactly sure what that means...
No, she's just driving over here, then we're taking my car. How do I look?
It's a plastic, yeah.
Go.
Oh yeah?
Gas good?
That's deep --
My act?!
Is that what's been bothering you -- Miss Olsen? That's ancient history.
No.
I said I had no family -- I didn't say I had an empty apartment.
Come on, Fran -- don't be like that. You just going to sit there and keep bawling? You won't talk to me, you won't tell me what's wrong -- Look, I know you think I'm stalling you. But when you've been married to a woman for twelve years, you don't just sit down at the breakfast table and say "Pass the sugar -- and I want a divorce." It's not that easy. Anyway, this is the wrong time. The kids are home from school -- my in- laws are visiting for the holidays -- I can't bring it up now. This isn't like you, Fran -- you were always such a good sport -- such fun to be with --
Well, that's more like it. At least you're speaking to me.
Yeah, I know, but poultry...?
Forty-two was a lean year around here. The war had just started... you were gone less than a month... and we were coming off a bit of a drought as I recall. Not everyone could ante up the price of a ticket, and a chicken's as good as money if you ask me. At that time, it meant a lot to the folks around here to be able to come to the pictures.
"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?"
Yes?
"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, 84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs."
Gary Cooper. And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa.
"February 10, 1942. Picture 'Ball of Fire.'"
Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here.
No, your mother did, then I did after she passed.
Um... Harry? Did I ever keep the books here?
I'm alright. But you can sit.
You're late.
I'm talking about a girl you want to fuck, so give me a break.
You're talking about the woman I love.
She's a jerk.
Debbie is not mediocre and she has one of the great bodies of all time.
I think Debbie Klein is a mediocre person with a good body.
Do you think she'll meet me in Rome?
Right.
I'm sorry. Northern England first, Italy later.
I don't know.
Well, anyway, do you think she'll be there?
I can't think of anything at the moment... I'd like you to write me out a slip, though, proving I came down here.
Quit my job.
If our feet get hot, you grab the piano.
Look, if you want to leave...
I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
Did you see this? This is your more exotic dirty magazine.
Oh yes. Very arousing women. They arouse me very much. But not as arousing as you.
Holy shit.
Holy shit!
Don't I know. Now go home to your wife.
What's that supposed to mean?
Loretta...
Then you get it. You'll understand.
Why?
Yeah. I, uh, well . . . No. It'll wait. Say, he's a nice man, isn't he? Mr. Norton, I mean. He's, er, he's done an awful lot for the
Flowers.
Thanks.
It's for Ann . . .
Oh!
She isn't?
Those guys bother you?
I don't think so.
OK.
Your daddy. Was quite a feller.
I'm sure you would.
No, you don't.
You sure? That doesn't sound --
You're wondering why I held it.
I'm wondering how the judge is gonna like my waking up his old bones. in the middle of the night.
Hundred dollars?
What do I gotta do?
Well, you shoot big-time pool, Fats. I mean, that's what everybody says, you shoot big-time pool. Let's make it two hundred dollars a game.
I'm Joel.
I hear you've been looking for me.
Yeah. That's right, too.
Big John! You think this boy is a hustler?
Do you like to gamble, Eddie? Gamble money on pool games?
Otherwise, you're not ugly.
It's okay -- I'll sit here.
Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
How old are you?
I don't like the way Drew spoken to you. But I feel better about it now because of the way you spoke back.
Well, we got that out of the way. Tell me, Celeste. What do you do for a living?
No--not much--excepting--
Ronny! Our mother has recovered from death!
That's sad, isn't it? He had to sit on that wall all by himself. He deserved to have somebody.
Please!
I don't care. I just don't have what it takes. They'd be better off with someone who'd never flown before.
George Zipp said that?
Excuse me, Doc, I've got a plane to land.
It took you, what, seven hours to buy a pair of shoes?
What...?
He didn't leave with them.
You know, I asked him about that. And he said that good manners are a way we have of showing other people that we respect them. See, you'd eat like a slob if you were alone, but since another human being is present, you show that person respect by going to the trouble of having proper manners. I didn't know that. I thought it was a way of appearing superior. Know what else he told me?
He thinks that I am a gentleman and that you are a lady!
Exactly! I thought a gentleman was somebody who owned horses. Turns out, the short and very simple definition of a gentleman or a lady is: someone who always attempts to make the people around him or her feel as comfortable as possible. That's it! If you don't do that, nothing else matters. The cars, the clothes, the houses...
From the oddest place. His parent's told him. I don't think I got that memo.
I don't know. Whatever you like it to be.
So why go to college?
Eddie. The name is Eddie.
Hey!
Just for a minute
Promise me you won't talk to any boys unless your sister is present.
Because she'll scare them away.
And here's Mike's partner, in more ways than one. A gal who doesn't think happiness ends with primates. The very lovely, Miss Desiree...
How about this, a Trojan donkey.
Hi, guys. We brought back a friend.
Yes, sir.
Who's got him?
Who?
Have you come to make peace with me?
I think they're announcing your flight.
Sure. I'd really like that. Thank you so much.
I read an article about this ...
He's ten.
It takes time --
Give my main man a raise!!
That's funny. It's interesting. I never gave it a thought before.
I do -- Maybe what this fight needs is something new -- a novelty.
Shape, nothin' -- They're afraid. They know everybody in the world's gonna see this fight an' none of them gotta prayer of beating me so they're makin' excuses so they don't have to be the chump that's gonna be whipped in front of the whole civilized world!!
No, man, it's very smart.
You're welcome.
So that was it? One bump in the road and you gave up?
Because I want you--will always want you--no other woman'll ever take your place. I want you more now than I did that first night-- You've forgotten all that, I suppose?
Good.
Thanks to me.
How are you? How's business?
How's that?
Be careful who sees it.
Oh yeah, and then what?
Hell, baby, I'm not in the third grade. Well, look - what' we gonna do next time -- have a nice long chat in the parlor?
You almost got into trouble back there.
Four.
Bill? Stop panicking. Kross isn't going anywhere and I don't need to spend the rest of the day watching his stock go down. I'll be in the office tomorrow.
The Red...? You're totally gone, aren't you?
WHO! WHO'S RUNNING?!! WHO HAVE WE BEEN CHASING!?? CAN I ASK THIS QUESTION NOW!!!
The Red Knight!
SAW WHO!!?
Isn't it great up here... He's gone now, but we had him on the run! We would've had his ass if we had horses! He's running scared!
Of course I want to.
Yes, but --
Is there a Mrs. Canfield?
It's simple. I like what I do -- I enjoy doing it. There aren't many men who love their work as much as I do. Look around some time.
-- there has to be a darn good reason for living the way you do. I want to know what it is.
What's the good of arguing about something that probably doesn't exist? Look, Hildy, I'm proposing to you. What do you say?
Don't you dare to be civil with me! All this time you were leading me on --
Aaaaa! Jesus! This isn't happening. I'm still hallucinating. Shit!
But... I don't remember anything, I swear...
Oh no... no....
This is... it's like a sick joke, I -
Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me. Something terrible's happened to me. I don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come in. Keep me here until I get over it.
I looked at the coroner's report. My father's O positive and my mother...A negative.
Yes.
So what?
Yes, I know.
Dead. Damnit!
Was he a law student at the time?
And you were a student also.
At college.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. So how did it happen?
I mean do you feel like telling me what were the circumstances?
What was your major?
Ya, ya goin' outta the bedroom an' I don't wanna know from nothin'.
I don't know what you mean.
Not here, Perry'll be calling at six to find out what's happening.
Let's go to my place.
Let's go to my place.
H-he's so awkward and he's clumsy like me...
I like him. I think he's a sweet guy.
The few times that I've met him... Isn't that a great mitt?
Looks like he's taking a trip--see the baggage? The only time they ever picked me up, McKinney walked through the room while they were grilling--let's see how good his memory is.
No, I happened to see you come in, and I thought --
Yeah--the blind foster home mother. It was good. I got Cahoon on it.
I have nothing left. I have Nothing to give you. I have no Pride, no dignity, no money. I Don't even know how we'll make a Living. But I promise I'll love You every second of your life.
Did you ever see the sun come up Over the Rockies? It hits all of A sudden and below there's California and you swear you're Looking at heaven.
The daughter of his enemy.
It's not a village. There's nothing there.
Eighty cents a word--three--six--nine words. That'll be seven twenty, but it's too much--I'll show you how to save some money.
No.
Well I'm glad you didn't, thank you.
I'm not, I'm very happy.
Let me tell you, Venice can't compare with Constantinople.
So--have you thought anymore about Dartmouth?
No, I'm alone.
Too bad we have to waste all that time.
I acted on your suggestion and got in touch with the Power and Light authorities. Whenever you want to visit their plants they are open to you.
There's something else which I know will appeal to you. A visit to the Paris sewers. They tell me it is extremely instructive.
How?
No... no, I don't think that's necessarily true.
Yeah. It's a fact.
You only think I guessed wrong -- -- that's what's so funny! I switched glasses when your back was turned. You fool.
Why have you done this?
Yeah. I know.
Because I knew you'd freak out and probably get so depressed you wouldn't even come on this trip. But then I figured here would be the best place to tell you. We're here to forget about all that shit. We're here to party!
I'm going to be a fucking pariah. Everyone's just going to be holding their breath to see if I'm going to get drunk and make a scene. Plus Tony fucking Levin?
Gotta admit, you guys are - two in four dozen.
Got enough, thanks. We're lookin' for a place has some music, where we can maybe do some dancin' - get somethin' to eat, too. Anything like that around here?
I'm not refuting anything.
Where's the one you're building?
What do you want?
What do you mean, four more?
Oh boy... In the club, or at home?
Pardon me?
Yeah. I could show it to you if you want to come over and see it.
Always thought "can't" wasn't in a man's vocabulary.
I love you too.
Jack, I'm disappointed. I guess I misjudged you.
Do you believe in what we're doing here, Private Johnson?
Well, he's living proof of that, son. Living proof.
Private Johnson, are you unhappy in the Army?
By blood you are. But blood only means what you let it.
My father says the day you're born you start from scratch, no breaks and no excuses, and you got to pull yourself up on your own.
When you were given the opportunity to enlist, a kind of contract was agreed upon. I think the Army has honored its part of that agreement.
Then how would you explain the fact that out of one hundred twenty people we tested, you're the only one who came up positive for drugs?
Ah. That's what I was going to do.
Listen, I gotta get some better shoes, few other things before tomorrow. Why don't you drop me off at the Ren Cen, we'll hook up later?
Don't you think it's sort of a waste for the two of us to...
It just occurred to me --
Speak up, please.
Sure.
Oh, I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I'm sort of flattered -- that anybody should think a girl like you -- would do a thing like this -- over a guy like me.
I know who y6u are. You're Dorothy Boyd. You're in... wait... you're in Accounts. You have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of Albert Einstein morphed onto Shaquille 0 Neal's body.
Well, take care.
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Quite a while.
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben --
You'll never be young again.
I don't believe you.
Mrs. Robinson --
How?
Mrs. Robinson -- I have a date with Elaine. We're going for a drive.
Now it seems to me --
Damn.
Have fun tonight?
And I'm in control of it.
We'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. That's a perfect excuse. There was no other safe big enough.
Now Comrades, I warn you... if it gets out in Moscow that we stay in the Royal Suite we will get into terrible trouble.
Thank you.
It's fucked -- now will you please tell I.A. that I'm just you average healthy totally fucked-up cop and let me get out of here?
No! I'm working my tail off. I'm off the sauce, I'm not even smoking anymore.
No.
It's been three months.
Please, call me Alan. We try to cultivate a casual atmosphere around here...
A broker? Really. And now you re in the tire business?
She knows everything? Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
She knows everything. She knows who she is.
Where's your dress?
Try to look at it this way. Buster and I are sitting right here beside you. We could have ended up in the incinerator!
Happy to be alive, under any circumstances--is that your point?
I'm happy I amuse you.
Try to look at it this way. What choice does Buster have? What are his options? Nobody will ever adopt him.
Well, this is an orphanage.
I think they help.
I just wish she'd get here, that's all.
Meyers, what's the deal with you and Vicky, anyway? You've been going out since Homecoming and all she'll do is blow you? Shit, I'd drop her like a steaming turd.
Stifler, you're such an asshole.
Dude, he does not.
Look, Mrs. Dreyfuss, you don't have to wait around. I'll wash the dishes and --
Say, where did you learn to dunk, in finishing school?
No, because they're-they're laughing, so I-I-I'd rather not. If you don't mind, I prefer-
I prefer not to, because... look, they're laughing at him. See, so what are yuh telling me-
that I've got to... ah... ah... They're gonna laugh at him for a couple minutes, then I gotta go out there, I gotta ... get laughs, too. How much can they laugh? They-they they're laughed out.
Well. I told my mother that we were to be married. And she got well. Right away.
This tastes horrible, hmmn?
Your lip's stopped bleeding, too, George.
It was a miracle!
What'd you say?
Oh, you mustn't say things like that. You . . . . . . wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's an idea. What do you think? Yeah, that'll do it. All right. You've got your wish. You've never been born.
I said I wish I'd never been born.
You've never been born. You don't exist. You haven't a care in the world.
What did you say?
Okay -- let's try and settle down here.
Yes?! To be married, I suppose.
I want every second I can get with you.
Rheya, I am not going back. I'm staying here with you.
You should have told me.
It does.
Hardly ever.
Me?
Uh-uh. That was a little girl named Mary Hatch. That wasn't you.
I'm not very good at this.
Okay what can we lose?
Hope so. Clean up with this boy.
She lives her own life in New Jersey, America.
No, no bible readers.
New Orleans, huh?... We was just there.
Restin' in our room. She ain't been feelin' well.
Sorry to hear it.
Thought you said this was a private club. How come I'm allowed in without bein' a member?
You black?
Long time ago. I was just thinking about her. I was her first boyfriend.
Alison's.
Do I know you?
I don't want you for my father!
Your father!
What you run out on me for! What you leave me alone for?
Plato!
You crazy nut! You crazy, crazy nut!
Get away from me!
When I introduce you, if I say who you are, I don't think anyone will stay for dinner.
Of course not!
There's never any
No thanks.
"Will be back in four weeks"-- --that saves you eighty cents right there!
But the plague
You must admit I have good taste.
Mr. Fennyman, I think you may have hit on something.
Tell me; have you done anything to secure my release? NO! Have you petitioned the court? NEVER! Sought audience with the Emperor --
It's the way of all martyrs, isn't it?
Yes! Now don't worry!
Really?
Yeah.
What are you getting at?
That's where he's being clever. Acting nonchalant.
No comment.
I can't believe you wrecked my car. You're driving drunk. It's pathetic.
It's three.
Patrick, we need to focus.
The thing is... my situation is a little weird. My girlfriend situation.
I don't know, maybe you did kill somebody.
Well it is pathetic. And fucking irresponsible. You could've killed somebody.
She came up here on her vacation, 'cause she likes shitty weather.
Why let Rocky here take a chance on cuttin' or breakin' a hand? -- Take a shower, Dipper.
You can forget about sparring, kid.
Not yellow, cautious. See, it's very easy for a fighter to accidentally hurt --
Meningitis? What the hell is meningitis?
Well, enough about the King, how 'bout you?
Well, I'm not running away any more. I'm settled now, above a saloon, it's true, but... walk up a flight. I'll be expecting you.
Did you run out on me because you couldn't take it? Because you knew what it would be like, hiding from the police, running away all the time?
Why not? After all, I got stuck with a railway ticket. I think I'm entitled to know.
All the same, someday you'll lie to Laszlo. You'll be there.
Donut, get your camera. See if it's broke.
You'd die for fun?
I told you the questions might get a little personal --
You shouldn't be driving around, you know. You're sick.
Think you could learn?
Oh, it's coming, it's coming.
Sam! I was just telling a few about your old man.
Me an' my wife are goin' home 'cause we miss our children an' can't go no more time without seein' them.
Bill Stuckey, Vivian. My wife, Elizabeth.
Francesca, listen to me. You think what's happened to us happens to just anybody? What we feel for each other? How much we feel? We're not even two separate people anymore. Some people search their whole lives for it and wind up alone -- most people don't even think it exists and you're going to tell me that giving it up is the right thing to do? That staying here alone in a marriage, alone in a town you hate, in a house you don't feel apart of anymore -- you're telling me that's the right thing to do!?
Yeah. It could get better.
TO HELL WITH YOU!
What is this?
You're a very unusual stenographer --
Tired?
Movies?
Moreover...
No, you gotta go 'cause if you don't get up there every couple weeks you feel guilty. I won't feel guilty, so I don't gotta go.
Small, blond, good-looking. She was with him when we met. She had a funny English accent.
I might not stay, anyway.
How do I know?
First, single mothers don't "date." They have been to the circus, you know what I'm saying? They have been to the puppet show and they have seen the strings. You love her?
Then you gotta have The Talk.
Yeah.
So what did you think?
What's wrong with it?
Nothing. I think you really blew the lid off nookie.
I'm in a pissy mood. I'm sorry.
Too bad you're not more like your father.
That's right -- It's gonna be the greatest sportin' event in this country's history -- A gala occurrence!
He's a freak.
It's not going to hurt me to get up.
Go ahead. Skin it. Skin that Smoke wagon and see what happens.
Just ask if they can recall recommending my services to anyone in the recent past. Say you re my secretary, all right?
I d appreciate it if you could do this for me. If you can t, don t worry about it. I ll call in about an hour anyway. Sorry but I m in a hurry.
Who screamed?
It was just a visitor. But it's all right now.
Look -- she's all right. She's upset and she screamed. But she's okay now.
What did you do to her?
They're ready now.
I don't know.
You have been robbed--for years. And not a hundred thousand francs, but millions. And you know who did it? Adolph.
Yeah and I got the bruises to prove it. So what?
I didn't ask any question.
Mariette!
Naturally not. But I expect the police to believe it.
Run into Josh?
Get this man a Kamikaze.
Yeah.
Is there a green elephant standing beside that bwana?
Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
So, you see how silly that rumor is?
I know, I know. But there's no truth in the story whatsoever.
As one Tribune man to another
But right now I'm acting in the capacity of Mrs. Schuyler's attorney.
I see, well this happens to be a Nocturne.
Big talk... Desperate guy.
I shouldn't have listened to you, I should've followed you right into the "can" the way he did.
I'm sorry about what happened.
Sooner, the better.
The Lisa Fremont who never wears the same dress twice?
Not too active.
Empty as a football.
Uh-huh.
I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since.
Vivian, how much to put up with me for the entire night?
I hope you find him.
Big talk for someone who's never been shot off her computer.
...Something like that.
If you close your eyes and listen to our voices we might be in Paris.
It's a real Paris reunion.
I think I need my glasses.
How nicely you've fixed the table, Ninotchka.
A little more tact... look how nicely she's fixed the table -- all for us.
How many families live here with you?
What a lovely room you have here.
Just three people in a room this size? Whew!
Oh, yes.
Do you think?
Thanks Lloyd.
I don t recollect mentioning a friend.
Well, we pay for the . That guy didn't want to part with it, a little matter of nine thousand dollars.
Something wrong?
Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later.
Tis not the sword that counts, but the man what swings it. Rest easy, Jack.
God protect you, Honeythorn Gump.
Stoutly spoke, lad. These dwarves be sore grouches... Pay no heed to their spiteful grumbling.
We're not in a tournament, Gump. Ah, but a sword twice tempered in the blood of living dragons...
Achilles wore it before the gates of Troy.
I pray always to be worthy of it.
How could it be irresponsible, Sir, if you were the first man in the world to do it?
You two could play checkers.
Sorry. It only plays static.
Baker's unabridged.
But you always seem so certain.
That was in Vietnam.
I killed Bob Ray Lemon, didn't I?
What could I be up to, Lula?
We got about forty bucks, sweetheart. That'd get us to El Paso.
Never, Sir. I just meant it's dangerous only for the kind of pilot who wants to show off, rather than inspire the other pilots in his unit. And all you've done for me, Sir, working out the transfer, I did it to say thanks. To honor you, Sir. What the French call a "homage."
Eddie, hold out all the hope you want but, I promise you, it's hope- less, it's over. Come on up, let's get drunk, if I had your shoulder to lean on I might actually enjoy this --
Fine, fine. Big doing up here. Why are you still down here?
I love you now, I'll love you always --
Thank you, Sir.
Susan --
Okay, Eddie -- anyway, thanks for the memory.
They don't stay the night, Jack, 'less you pay for it.
Gotcha.
Oh, I'm a lot like you -- just looking for an ass to mount.
What d'you mean?
Two days.
What do you want from me?
Not because you have to.
You write this?
Mercutio's soul is but a little way above our heads staying for thine to keep him company!
What are they?
...All right, Eve. If you say so.
Uh huh.
Well, don't just sit there, shoot him.
You're always making jokes. That's what you do, isn't it? Make jokes. Making jokes is the one thing you're good at, isn't it? But if you make a joke about this - - I'm gonna go completely out of my fuckin' head!
Orange juice -- probably not.
Keep your shirt on. Let me read. Westley had no money for marriage. So he packed his few belongings and left the farm to seek his fortune across the sea.
Sure you don't want to go out and find some karoake? I'm a very good singer, man --
Eighteen yards. That's my house there.
Hello?
Could you find out if they know anythin'? I don't know they know shit about us. But I don't wanna think, I wanna know. You could find out for sure what's goin' on. Daddy?
Great. I'll see you at the office at nine.
I thought the spare set was in the kitchen drawer.
What kind of truck?
He's gone. Did you get a license plate? Or a make?
Yes, but no, I can't right now.
Hearsay.
I hate peas.
You're sweet. And sexy. And completely hot for me.
No one else knows
Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger. You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I. And I still do, and you don't.
No, but...
But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?
And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...
Okay. Tell me, would I have to pay a wet rag as much as I pay you?
Hello.
Yes -- I'm sorry -- I had to leave... I didn't want to disturb you.
I m telling you, those rules don t apply to me, Arn.
You don't do that anymore, do you?
Our identification.
I know that.
You'd have to organise it up here.
That's what they want you to think, but I saw where she lived, what is she's trying to get away from. Just take my word for it, pard. Break it off now. Do it this week.
A little.
I guess...some of them are probably faking.
O.K. O.K. Without the bird seed. What do you want?
That's what you've been looking for -- a farter?
Look, it's just that something about him struck me as odd last night. He gave me this funny vibe. Anyway, I called some friends back east. They don't know of any architect named Patrick Healy and he's not listed as a Harvard alumnus.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I thought so. Anyway, I hope you don't think I'm being meddlesome. I just think you should be careful with this guy.
I mean let's face it, Mary, you're beautiful, you've got money, you trust people -- I'm just saying, there's a lot of psychos out there.
What're these?
The zoo. What are you waiting for?
He thought it was a ghost.
Well, like I told your wife, it's really up to Pilgrim.
I'm out of ammo!
How much longer do you think?
We still have a way to go.
I can't believe it's the same horse.
And it is guarded by sixty men.
And our assets?
Your brains, Fezzik's strength, my steel.
Good-bye, look in your backpack.
No?
I haven't, no. Sorry.
What?
I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
Thank you...
No thanks.
Are you busy tonight?
Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.
Listen, Angie, I wanna tell you, you were very impolite last night. I introduced you to the girl, you just turned and walked off. Now, why did you do that?
It wasn't pretty after, no, but if you were in that car -- eating a sandwich -- you wouldn't have known what hit you.
No thanks. I never touch French cigarettes.
What the hell are you doing?
Like a baby. You?
Yeah, well, I wish God would go a little easy on the trumpets.
You're leaving?
They asked me to help.
I see you got the telegram.
See you later, alligator.
Hey, if you're ordering lunch for Mierzwiak, would you --
Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
Yeah, the plan was to pick him up at his office tomorrow, take him out to his house in Bloomfield Hills. Now, I don't give a shit what they do.
You're gonna bust me for picking up a car?
Listen, these guys, they're gonna be out here any minute looking for me. They're fucking animals.
Nothing. I just wanna get the fuck outta here.
Rippin' off Ripley was my idea, but these guys, man, they're into shit I can't handle.
Major Strasser, my aide, Lieutenant Casselle.
Unoccupied France welcomes you to Casablanca.
Thank you, Captain. It's very good to be here.
You may find the climate of Casablanca a trifle warm, Major.
Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend. He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience.
Jesus... I'm glad Hannah got us together. You know, she's got a great instinct for people. Really.
Well, if you didn't like it, you didn't like it, but you didn't have to talk while the guy was singing.
And you don't have to snort cocaine at the table all the time! What do you, what do you do? Carry a kilo around in your purse?
Yeah, that's tough! You don't deserve Cole Porter. You should stay with those groups that look like they're gonna stab their mother!
Well, there's a story behind all that. I'll tell you when I see you. By the way, I won't be alone. I'm bringing my wife with me.
Tomorrow.
What's up? Why're leavin' Detroit?
I'm a married man.
Get the fuck outta here!
I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded.
That's what he said.
Evelyn, put her to bed.
Well, if he calls in, tell him to get in touch with L. B. Jefferies right away. I might have quite a surprise for him.
Oh. When are they expected home?
This is L. B. Jefferies, a friend of Tom's. Who am I talking with?
So what's the plan?
The plan is... you go.
Horny as shit. Flopping around like a landed trout.
Wasn't supposed to be back till six. Fucker rolls in at five.
Cutting it a little close, don't you think? So how was she? Compared to Stephanie, say.
Yeah.
So what the fuck were you thinking?
She tell you she was married?
No, a bomb. Now, as discreetly as possible, I want you to move the passengers into the lounge.
Hey, what is this? You got black soap?
Well, Elaine, this might be it if those guys on the ground don't think of something.
That might be the news we've been waiting for.
Which passenger is Joe Salucci?
He's carrying a bomb.
Okay, give me a bottle of wine.
You know, darling, this is going to be a wonderful party.
Not yet.
Take the boss loading, kid. For God's sake. I don't want to hurt you.
But why do you call me 'Mr. Di Vita'? It didn't used to be that way...
Wait! I'll go with you!
Okay. Why don't we do something visionary. Change your destiny, Peggy Sue. Change your destiny and marry me.
No.
But I ain't out. I'm in. I'm in. Who's lying to who?
Jimmy, suppose I knew something, say a mug somebody put on somebody... . You think I should turn him in?
Looking for me?
Yeah us Golden Warriors. You're a good kid, Jimmy, a good tough kid. We stick together, huh, kid?
Yeah, I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You don't think I should turn him in... .
You can trust me.
Forget about me and Mom -- are you going to marry him?
Do you love Drew?
I know it's none of my business --
I am. With you.
Thank God. Now could we go? Let's get this day started.
It wasn't like that.
I didn't care about the money.
Wait I...
What a fruitcake you are!
Do what?
I don't know her last name... I'll be off in a second.
I had to scrap all my life. Figured I might as well get paid for it. When I was a kid my old man got killed never mind how. Charley and I was put in a place they called it a Children's Home. Some home! I run away and peddled papers, fought in club smokers and But what am I runnin' off at the mouth for? What do you care?
Where? Why?
You're worried about your college applications.
One of your secrets.
What are you going to -- ?
You're going to take a year off? Join the Peace Corps -- ?
No -- no, I'm don't.
Aye.
My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter. To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R. Best friend!
Goodnight Shelly.
I'm tired of bingo, maybe we should try that drive in of yours.
I slept with your sister.
Tush, thou art deceived. Hast thou no letters to me from the priest? No matter. Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee tonight. I will hence tonight.
Want to hear my philosophy? Do it to him before he does it to you.
Eleven. In the middle of the party, some gulls came down at the children. And Miss Daniels was attacked by a gull just yesterday after...
These birds were...
That's right. We had a party here this afternoon for Cathy. Her birthday.
All right, I'll grant you a bird'll panic in an enclosed room. But, they didn't just get in. They came in! Right down that chimney.
Mr. Mintz.
That turn you on there, RuPaul?
Well?
Don't kid yourself--you know how I stand back there.
Of course not-- --but isn't it a coincidence that he's from the eighteenth precinct--where they made the squawk?
That's right--you're the one I was looking for. You'll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?
Will you explain what's going on?
Nay, lad, we're here to collect a weapon you'll need fighting the Baron.
Did you bring me here to sup?
Sunlight.
What weapon?
Easier than that, Jack. Screwball! Fetch me down a couple of them plates.
Plan on carrying some away in a kettle?
They'll do nicely.
I'm an idiot to have you up there.
At least I won lunch.
The last two messages I got? The first one was from my wife telling me she was leaving! And the second was from my lawyer telling me he was leaving too... with my wife.
I've never gotten a message that wasn't bad news.
I'm in love with you.
Honey I'd be proud to be your father, really. It just isn't so.
Hello.
It's my life. If I want to fuck it up, that's my business.
But why him?
This is very interesting. We are born knowing our history. We have other books. But not a book like this.
I want to get money for you and the baby.
Inflation, tuition, college. Children are damned expensive. I know.
Yes.
Never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.
No, that's not all.
It better be worth it for me.
Friedman s dead... They killed him...
Aye.
Well here we are a family again. Been so long plain forgot how Good it feels. Want to thank you For that, Wyatt. All your doin'.
Look at that. Busted. Brand new Money Ward, too. 33 years old And I don't even have a decent Watch. 'Bout time I started Lookin' out for myself.
Boy, look at all those stars. Bet You can see every star there is. Practical touch 'em. Kinda makes You think, you know? I mean you Look up and you think God made All that but he still remembered To make a little speck like me. Kinda flattering really. Hey, Wyatt, you believe in God? No, Come on, really, do you?
We're gonna do it, boys. Gonna Get ours. Feel it in my bones. All we have to do is keep our Eyes on that brass ring.
Ah, he's always too heavy on the vinegar. If you really want a good one, you gotta let me make it.
My dad's always here running the store, busy and stuff...and I fill in once a week so he can get a night off.
So you're going to Michigan?
Onions?
You want onions?
I'm not touchy, I just, it's a Silly question, that's all. Am I Happy? Are you happy?
This universe?
You're violating the laws of the universe.
Yes, and stop repeating everything I say, and turning it into a question. Spooning, fooling around, God knows what. You arrive on the scene -- why you picked me, I still don't under- stand --
I make my own luck.
Fifty pounds? What for?
Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men. For fifty pounds my hired player days are over.
Cut out my heart! Throw my liver to the dogs!
No, then.
To my weekly confession.
Words, words, words once, I had the gift I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups out of clay love that overthrows empires, love that binds two hearts together come hellfire and brimstones for sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery but now
Climb down off your cross. They already knew about her. She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you?
Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college...
Well, that's not what they think.
Her name was right there in front of them. They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them.
Thank me publicly? For what? For ruining this woman's life?
So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers. That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself.
Oh god, oh, god, no, I...
You should keep track of your old school chums. Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for "Studio One" on CBS.
Who by?
Not at all, I enjoyed --
Oh I know plenty. I was raised by a single mother.
Tell me, because it's been a month, and she's about to take another job in San Diego.
One last question, Doctor. If someone didn't know better, would it be easy to mistake the peony root for cocaine?
A previous witness stated that she saw Miss Lawson pouring a white powder into her hand on October twenty-eighth. According to your records when did you prescribe the drug?
How do you instruct your patients to take it?
Would you describe for the court what Chinese peony root looks like?
What did you prescribe for her?
The peril of composing such incendiary prose...
It's the only frontier I have left, plumcake.
Did I frighten you?
If only these coins purchased your other talents, too.
What does he know about the Highlands?
No. Are you're leaving?
Come on.
How do you really know there's gold in Fort Knox? Just because they say so? We should go to Tennessee and demand to see it.
You think so?
The sheriff and the deputy and I inspected the deck closely. We found a small fracture in the wood of the gunnel. Just below the mast.
Everything had to happen just right. For your little story to fly. I mean, a blond hair could be on that gunnel for a lot of reasons.
I'm sorry, was there a question in there?
Now that's bullshit, Lee. Every time you buy one of those little movies it's a risk. I'm not sellin' you something that's gonna play two weeks, six weeks, then go straight to cable. This is "Doctor Zhivago". This'll be packin' 'em in for a year and a half. Two years! That's two years you don't have to work with anybody's movie but mine.
Nor have you!
Yeah, but you know what's his best film and nobody's even seen it?
Books, records, films -- these things matter. Call me shallow but it's the damn truth, and by this measure I was having one of the best dates of my life.
Exactly! Fucking ex-actly!
Yes. You?
It's not important in itself -- some elevator boy you fired came to me claiming you'd stolen the idea for the, uh, the hoop dingus from him --
Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
This is it, lady. Last stop.
Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
Rest, Highness.
No, it's you too, Judy. Something in you.
Lednov.
They sure must have been travelin'. This keeps up we can start a store.
Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump.
Things get tough next winter, you'll have somethin' to wear.
Anybody hurt?
What's the matter with her?
Then you would use your--
Okay I'll tell him I couldn't bring you in. Ten to one they won't believe it, but go ahead, blow. Jump out, quick, and keep going... and God help you from here on in.
It was you, Charley... .
You don't understand! I could've been a contender. I could've had class and been somebody. Real class. Instead of a bum, let's face it, which is what I am. It was you, Charley.
I tried to keep you in good with Johnny.
See! You don't understand!
It wasn't him! It was you, Charley. You and Johnny. Like the night the two of youse come in the dressing room and says, "Kid, this ain't your night we're going for the price on Wilson." It ain't my night. I'd of taken Wilson apart that night! I was ready remember the early rounds throwing them combinations. So what happens This bum Wilson he gets the title shot outdoors in the ballpark! and what do I get a couple of bucks and a one-way ticket to Palookaville. It was you, Charley. You was my brother. You should of looked out for me. Instead of making me take them dives for the short-end money.
Gee, when you tipped one seventy-five you were beautiful. You should've been another Billy Conn. That skunk I got to manage you brought you along too fast.
...eight-seven, eighty-eight. What's it to you?
What do you weigh these days, slugger?
I must ask for that back.
They will serve salad.
...Did you happen to see the front page of today's Manhattan Argus?
Are ya closed to the General Public or to just everybody.
I think mebbe we're early or somethin' --
Wait here, gotta smooth this guy out.
An' you're dyin' alone, too.
Listen, I gotta problem. This girl ain't feelin' well, y'know -- The doctor says she should exercise, y'know once in awhile an' ice skatin' is the best thing --
I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
How much we got?
Eleven thousand four hundred, cash. Here in my pocket.
The name's Gordon. Bert Gordon.
Mister. You been sittin' in that spot for hours. Would you mind moving? It bothers me.
Hey, mister.
Preacher, go on down and get me some breakfast, will ya? Egg sandwich and a cup of coffee. You want something, Charlie?
Now wait a minute. You're coming with me. You're gonna eat breakfast at the hotel. Pool game is over.
Bill, after this deal, you'll be able to afford one.
I'm likin' you guys better
I prefer to think of it simply as an alternative to what the law allows.
Don't make me do it, man
Gigglepuss is playing there tomorrow night.
It's her favorite band.
Assail your ears for one night.
What are you doing here?
What else is new?
Yeah.
Maybe it's for old-time's sake.
So whatdya say? I'll get the check, and I'll call you in eight months.
You are the first woman I'm going out with.
You did?
You look good.
Wow.
The color of your hair...
You look like you've had quite a work-out.
So what happened to you?
Fair enough.
You too.
So when are you authorized to use deadly force?
So it's not a meaningful symbol, or anything. That badge is just the badge of your company. If I look suspicious on your customers' property-- well, under those heightened circumstances you have the authority to, ah... To shoot me.
There's a Harley behind those bushes. Get back to the laboratory and start working on the formula. We don't have time to ask questions. Just synthesize it-
Leo, you're my agent. Tell "them" to take a flyin' piss. I didn't do anything wrong. I fought in the war, for crissakes!
They know you were at that meeting, Peter. They've been told, and they know.
What? That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one?
Kid, that cuts no ice with them.
Exactly.
I know. A Purple Heart.
I was decorated.
Fought? Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix.
At least I was on our side! Look, they want me to testify? I'll testify. I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear! Jesus, Leo, this is my career!
You broke your arm. You were coming out of a bar. You were drunk.
King wasn't Mexican, Fenton--
Oh, you know, the usual troublemakers. Danny Padilla from the Sentinel, that crowd.
I heard there was a bit of a fuss.
Big day coming up--I wish we'd have thought of it while he was still living. But he went so unexpected.
People didn't complain?
And my father?
But Charles' appointment was last week, not --
Five o'clock -- Thursday -- the Garden -- it's got to be something around here.
Now what?
It's Thursday today -- and it's almost five -- come on!
as outlined in report number three- nine-stroke-five-two of the Western Hemisphere Conference held on March 22 -- no wait! It was last Thursday, five o'clock at the Jardin des Champs- lys es! Adam -- that was it! The garden!
Well -- it was a place -- a street corner, I think. But I don't -- Hold it. I'm on.
There is? Well, I can't say I think very much of a silly law like that. Think, Reggie -- please think -- what was written in Charles' notebook?
Of course there is!
Come on, let me drive.
You look different... More relaxed.
No, I'm okay.
Want me to drive?
Somehow I don't think inviting Maya to your wedding is the right move. In fact, after your bullshit, it's going to be hard for me to even go to the Hitching Post again.
Hey, why don't you invite Maya to the wedding?
That was quite a day yesterday.
Hrnrnrn?
Quite a week.
Yep. Quite a day.
Pilar--
You've got your mother, your kids--
I got to admit it's not what I thought it'd be. Back When Buddy had it-- hell, I'm just a jailer. Run a 60- room hotel with bars on the windows.
Got divorced, I wasn't gonna work for my father-in-law anymore. The fellas down here said they'd back me--
How did you lose that key? Oh, George, this is uh Miss -- this is Jackie.
That's what they think... Guild and all of them. They take it for granted that it's just another of Wynant's victims. Guild's hot-footing it around now, looking for Wynant. That's all that troubles him.
Guess I must've learned.
Yup. Don't you want something to eat?
Yes yes... any moment... you're always so impatient...
Let's see.
You think you are ready now?
"One day, Fanchon's first client was a surgeon. He ran his fingers across her naked skin, pulling apart folds of flesh, inspecting each and every follicle..."
Do you remember the last time you saw him?
It tastes wonderful!
You understand which side the gelatin's on?
Don't worry, I'll straighten all this out.
Who needs that kind of aggravation? Who needs that kind of aggravation at my age? When I finish work I want to...
Boy, beautiful day, hey, Thomas?
The case was stolen?
There was this guy with a limp who came a month ago..said he was an art dealer ... Asking all these questions about the Sacred Stones..at the time I didn't think anything of it.. What was his name? I'm so bad with names...
Perfect.
Money.
Oh shit!!!
The extraterrestrial now looks like this.
Clarify that.
It's made itself look like the woman's dead husband.
Why did you let it get into a populated area?
It's taken on a disguise.
I don't want to have any conversation.
Like what? The moons of Jupiter?
Your book and your brown sweater and your hair. What's more to know -- ?
Were?
Naturally I did.
Who?
What about her?
Who knows? Guys a lot smarter than me are dropping out like flies.
All right -- thirty-five, and not a cent more!
Don't mock, Hildy, this is bigger than anything that's happened to us. Don't do it for me! Do it for the paper.
If you won't do it for love, how about money? Forget the other offer and I'll raise you twenty-five bucks a week.
You've got to help me, Hildy.
It'll bring us together again, Hildy -- just the way we used to be.
Big weddings are so strange.
I'm crazy about you!
Almost.
Could this be him?
No I didn't say that.
My friend Carlos is doing it who works with me. It's his. It's his pudding, he's doing it. It's not mine. He's crazy. I told him not to do it. He's the one who's insane. He only spent about one hundred dollars so far though --
....yeah....
....No....
To belong to someone.
To keep what's up there from getting down here! It's not the radiation I'm worried about.
I thought ten years.
You were great. Thanks alot.
Can you use these?
No. I'm sore.
One purse-- empty. One vanity case--
The coward!
Yeah, and, as you can see, home invasions are big, too.
Really, Marietta, you got more scenarios swimmin' around in your brain than Carter got pills. Try to take it easy. Go over to Myrtle Beach for a few days.
No, Marietta, I haven't found 'em.
Just part of life on the road, peanut.
You don't feel you was a little hard on the guy, honey?
Yeah.
Ancestors?
I can't pretend to be your husband... David's in great shape.
Now you're lying.
No!
Sixty.
Yes.
Yes.
That's pretty good for a ghillie.
I swear to god.
I don't write.
But that didn't stop me from sending out audition tapes to bigger stations and the networks.
Listen to me. You keep on thinking I'm somebody ho lacks...confidence. That's not it. I know I can talk well enough and I'm not bad at making contact with people, but I don't like the feeling that I'm pretending to be a reporter. And half the time I don't really get the news I'm talking about. It isn't that I'm down on myself. Trust me, I stink.
I didn't even have the chance to get really good at sports. I wasn't bad. I thought I was starting to do interesting features but hockey is big at the station and...
Can you live with it?
One year...almost one year.
Maybe not. But I need you to know. I love you. And I will come back. I'll find a way. And then we'll get a chance to know if what I felt the first moment I saw you, and every minute since then, is real.
Didn't you say you told her not to come?
Then why are you looking for her?
Yeah.
It's a test. If I asked her to come and she came, it wouldn't tell me anything. If I tell her not to come, and she comes...then I know she loves me.
The theatres are all closed by the plague!
Are you married?
Any children?
Next, please.
For whom else have you worked?
No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
Yes, sir. Here is my letter.
Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
Yes, sir.
When was that?
Your report says death by drowning, which means he went into the water alive and breathing. And the report is accurate...?
No, c'mon, I wanna know. I wanna keep score.
Oh, stop talking about yourself like you're a lush or something. I don't like it. Maybe you ought to go to a clinic, get some treatments.
You got it all in your head?
What did all this stuff cost you?
I'm hungry.
Oh yeah, right-between the power mower and the weed killer.
You're far crueler than I, my sweet.
Honey that's very mature, I'm proud of you Vada.
Who is this girl?
Will you shut up!?!!
That's what I want you to do, you moron!
Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
Do what?
Turn her over to a stalker.
What?! You're calling me a stalker?
That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
Oh Christ... poor dog.
You're a sick man, you know that?
Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
Your turn?
That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
You didn't answer the beeper either.
I don't want you to walk--I want to carry you. Should I put the top up? It might get cold.
How do you propose I write it? With dust, upon the air?
I am going to get my nut on this trip, Miles. And you are not going to fuck it up for me with all your depression and anxiety and neg-head downer shit.
Ooooh, now the cards are on the table.
I really did miss your mind while I was out at Pee Dee, honey. The rest of you, too, of course. But the way your head works is God's own private mystery. What was it you was thinkin'?
What color is it supposed to be?
First take your glass and examine the wine against the light. You're looking at color and clarity.
I don't know. Wine? Fermented grapes?
What do you smell?
But this is class kid, all the way. What a way to go.
Now tip it. What you're doing here is checking for color density as it thins toward the rim. Tells you how old it is, among other things, usually more important with reds. This is a very young wine, so it's going to retain its color pretty solidly. Now stick your nose in it.
Are you crazy!? You know that's totally impractical. Besides, like the Bible says... An eye for an eye...
Hey, my snakeskin jacket... Thanks, baby... Did I ever tell you that this here jacket for me is a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom?
Stab it and steer.
The shooter local?
Fifty dollars?
Well, if every time someone did something offensive they hit in the head with a pebble, I think they might alter their behavior. What do you think Jack...
I don't know.
Why did you do that?
Huh-huh. I'm deeply smitten.
What's her name?
You wouldn't know it. It doesn't matter. What's the difference?
Once in a while, you know. I mean, you know, every now-
Right, Max, forget it. Aren't you gonna be late for meeting Annie?
No. Yeah, once in a while. You know, like occasionally.
I'm... I'm, uh, I'm Robert Redford.
Yeah.
What I will do is keep names out of it till we got some answers or hit a dead end. You know how the press is with a murder story--even if it's forty years old.
Yes.
The limitless power of...
Where have you been hiding?
I've stared into the face of evil... ...and I've lived to tell the tale. Now... for your own sake... let me write it down.
Gibberish, my friend. He rants and he raves --
Without Raziel we'll never find Tir Asleen. We'd better go.
Delusion... a kind of magic which works against the magician.
Faith.
Always.
Precisely. Faith has persuaded them a pygmie with a sling can kill an armed giant.
No. Smashing is not required. I have a surprise for our tiny invaders... Raise that hatch!
But don't you like anything about what you do?
Is this your gun?
Well, sure... that's good, then. All I mean is, I'm lucky I met you.
We're safe here. I hope. What do you think?
Come out come out wherever you are!
Shut up. Are you nuts?
Hey where'd you go?
I'm here. Shut up.
Judy.
Help me in!
No...
Good for you, Toto. Good for you... I'm only saying this for your own good... Cooped up in here you die of heat in the summer and of cold in the winter. You breathe in smoke, gas fumes, and earn practically nothing.
How'd they get it inside?
She could buy and sell you ten times over.
She deserves every penny. They pay great athletes a fortune. Well, Marylin Rexroth is an athlete at the peak of her power.
...and I hear she's richer than Croesus.
Ah, but is she richer than Mrs. Croesus?
She owes me a meal.
I'd stay away from her, Miles.
Get me Marylin Rexroth Doyle.
What...?
Yes, m'sieu.
The one who said he was Dyle's brother -- of course I'm sure -- Tex wrote the word 'Dyle' before he died. He's the murderer I tell you -- he's the only one left! You've got to do something!
Just a minute, Mrs. Lampert -- you'd better give that to me slowly. Who's Adam?
No, I do -- it was the stamps on that letter Charles had with him on the train. They were in plain sight all the time, but no one ever bothered looking at the envelope.
Calm down, Mrs. Lampert -- please. Does he have the money?
Yes, I'm leaving now -- goodbye.
The envelope -- imagine that. Mrs. Lampert, listen to me -- you're not safe as long as you've got these stamps. Go to the Embassy right away -- wait, I'd better meet you halfway -- it's quicker. Now, let's see -- do you know the center garden at the Palais Royal? -- yes, by the colonnade -- as soon as you can get there. Hurry, Mrs. Lampert.
You live like a pig.
Not bad for a three and a half year old! I'd like to see the public school system match that! I don't care how terrific it is!
Nonsense. People have no idea what the human mind is capable of. Look at us!
Thank you. But I think I ll go to bed. It s been a long day.
You'll have to clear that through my landlord --
We have all -- what?
Don't be too hard on him. He's a steady worker. I wish he'd get there, though.
Hey! Will you slow down! When did you learn how to drive?
Still -- those witnesses.
Fine. I'll talk to her. Give me the phone, quick. She's the only one I'm going to talk to from now on.
It's awfully nice of you to show me around like this.
Who? Miss Dawson?
Yes, sir.
The Aquarium was swell. If I lived in New York, I'd go there every day. I'll bet you do.
This is how I dress all the time.
I thought I'd take it off for the drive over to IBM. It's kind of uncomfortable.
You really want me to put all this stuff back on?
I don't know. I'm not sure. He said there are people who want to lose, who are always looking for an excuse to lose.
He knows. A lot.
Well, he owns things.
He's a gambler.
Well, what else does?
Nothing's the matter. Is it, sweetheart?
Jack.
Your doorbell doesn't work.
Honey, it's only Uncle Jack. You remember Uncle Jack.
Well, look at this.
Where you going?
It's early.
Rod, I say this with great respect, but those players you mentioned are marquee players and --
Is that your porty or mine?
Great word. Towel?
No, I air-dry.
But how did you get "kwan?" 82.
Angie, by the time I get Clara home, it's gonna be one, one-thirty. By the time I get home, it's gonna be two o'clock. I gotta get up for ten o'clock mass tomorrow.
That's your word?
Yeah, man, it means love, respect, community... and the dollars too. The package. The kwan.
It's Saturday night! There's still plenty-a action around!
You.
I don't care what you said, we had an agreement. You've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.
Why don't you go? You should sleep.
Dance with me. I want to touch you. I want the things which are mine. Which belong to me.
Yeah. Well, was the least I could do.
That's very good news. The readers of 'Horse and Hound' will be absolutely delighted.
I'm sorry.
What happened?
You okay?
You think that's the answer? Sex? Is that what you want? You want me to make love to you?
Thirty-five next generation microchips. Copper, not silicon. Value: one million each.
Yes -- Oh -- oh -- yes, --
I know -- I know -- when a man's collar is an inch too big for him -- I know he is ill.
Oh -- Doctor -- you are a Doctor -- I am --
And this is Doctor Otternschlag.
Oh, a Baron!
I'm Baron von Gaigern.
Faith is angels dancing on the head of a pin. I got to have trust.
No just Parry.
What cold? And after the show, we could go out on the town -- I've been taking from Arthur Murray.
Oh, I even know who you live with -- your sister and brother-in- law -- I know when you were born -- and where -- I know all sorts of things about you.
She won't tell me everything. It's a bank job, that's all I know.
And this is our other..uh...co-worker.. Parry..uh...Parry....
What do you think?
Will she scratch up your back?
Whose show was this on?
Jed's got cables.
That's Lieutennt Hurwitz. Severe shell shock. He thinks he's Ethel Merman.
No. No thank you.
A year-and-a-half later, we were both in Hawaii for the Pro Bowl. Now I've always hit a wall at 18 months. Every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. It's like --ka- boom. The curse of 18 months.
Alfredo, damn him! He cast his spell on you too!
The whole idea of God was dreamed up by a silly animal with a small brain called Man. Even the limits we put on it are human limits. It can do this, it can do that! It designs, it creates!
It's something.
You're talking about a man in a white beard again. You're ascribing human characteristics to something that isn't human. Human beings look for causes and patterns. How could we know what Solaris is up to, if anything?
Then there is a God. Why don't we take that baby picture.
If all the kids jumped off a bridge, would you do that too?
Don't worry. I'll pay for it. What a you charge? Huh? Twenty, thirty, fifty bucks, maybe? Are you a fifty dollar whore?
Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
I don't need this--I know all about my condition.
I don't need your gratitude.
I wasn't intending to leave here in order to be entirely useless--I expect I'll find some ways to be of use.
Doubtless you'll let me know what immensely worthwhile or at least useful thing it is that you find to do.
What's the idea, Anne?
Are you really so stupid that you imagine you're going to find a more gratifying life? What you're going to find is people like the poor people who get left here--only nobody takes care of them as well! And you won't be able to take care of them, either. There's no taking care of anybody -- not out there!
Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
In other parts of the world, I suppose there are other ways.
Luckily. The closer I watched, the more the fault came into focus. Each imperfection its own adorable slice of vulnerability.
She's too genuine.
How can you trust someone you can never mistrust?
My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.
I'll wait for him.
I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
... It was like... the minute I saw her... I knew. She looked so damn adorable in a cop's uniform... puttin' on a big, tough act...
No, no seriously! There's a study done on this, you walk this way, the muggers are gonna single you out.
Absolutely. Look at this.
How often do you go through this little ritual?
The suit needs it more than I do, anyway.
I don't believe it.
Every day. The manufacturer recommends it.
All this because of that whore!
Yeah. It was.
Well hell, Wyatt. Wyatt, I want You to meet Father Feeney. Father Feeney's just been initiating me Into the mysteries of the great And ancient Church of Rome. You See, it appears my hypocrisy Knows no bounds.
I still haven't made up my mind yet.
I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
Yeah?
I imagine it would, yes. So now We can add self-pity to your list Of frailties.
No. I --
Well, I should probably get going.
Thanks.
I don't know -- how's "dedication" for an answer?
Why are you even here, man? You could have told me all this over the phone.
Not everyone has what you have.
I'm trying to talk to you. How's your marriage?
No, you're --
Mon bureau co tait trop cher.
I'm asking you a question --
Tu sais o me trouver.
Viens.
No shit, I'm never gonna get laid. How the hell am I gonna become this Mr. Sensitive Man?
How observant you are. As a matter of fact, I wanted to give you a word of advice.
Our entertainment is enough.
You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
I see. And what's Strasser doing here? He certainly didn't come all the way to Casablanca to witness a demonstration of your efficiency.
Here you are.
Perhaps not.
That's all right.
Threats won't make me love you. Tis not the way of the human heart.
And as barren of love as stone.
No, I was happy, but I just didn't realize I was happy.
Computer's down. Septuplets story. I need it back by five. Hopefully the copy's not a mess.
Why?
That's right. I'm on my way over to this officer school in Port Ranier.
So what're you doing in Seattle?
Zackie, nothing you do will ever surprise me, pard, not after some of the shit you've pulled.
Get ready pard. This one's gonna blow you away.
Who gave you this idea?
I know all your tricks.
You would?
But, Anya, dear! Unless you play we won't have a fourth.
So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
I should be in therapy.
I love her so bad. She just... wrecks me. I would die for her.
Hello?
I'm thinking when I'm home.
Before the coma!
He didn't tell me anything. All he said was Saint Severin...
Where's the ADM? Where did your uncle put it?
Man, I don't know what the fuck you're talking about.
Bullshit! Your uncle told you!
My uncle's in a coma you moron!
Merde! I can't believe this!
What?
Hook up the jab, hook up the jab.
Jesus Christ. I get in a good mood. How hard is it just to decide to be in a good mood, and then be in a good mood?
Look, I'm really sorry that Mom and Dad made you take me in. Really. If it's such a big deal, I'll go. But remember this, it used to be fun. It used to be warped, twisted and hilarious, and I mean that in the best possible way, I mean it as a compliment. I mean, I'm sorry T-I-M left you. But I am not T-I-M.
Yeah.
Good. Good. Glad is good.
You're hanging by a very thin thread, dude. And I dig that about you.
I'm out here for you! You don't know what it's like to be me out here for you. It is an up-at-dawn pride-swallowing seige that I will never fully tell you about! Okay?! Help me help you help me help you.
No tell me. 84.
Forget it. Forget it.
Happy. He said "happy?"
Listen to me, Peter. You can't let the ravings of a madman disturb you, okay?
Any friends?
I'm getting them for twelve dollars a night.
Twelve dollars! -- For those rheumatic uncles of yours? Out shooting everybody they see for the fun of it?
Now, listen, Fred. Just give me a few hours before you make any decisions. I'll get results. I'm doing everything humanly possible. I've just sworn in four hundred deputies.
Four hundred! Do you want to bankrupt this administration?
...comes off third cleat from the stern, port side. And it's brand new. Unlike the rest.
Liza Sutton is dead.
Then I can't be hurt anymore.
He's looking down. And he's not thinking 'bout the man you were yesterday. He's proud of the man you are tonight. That's what counts.
And that is the last time any...
I've been told that before.
Irving Berlin.
No-one should own music. The real question is who wrote the song?
I liberated it.
Is there a song you don't know?
Top Hat.
For?
The milkmaid's daughter?
Would you have me spend my life all alone?
What are you doing in my room?
I locked the door! Get out! I locked the door! Get out!
Aye. That foul wallow be where Jenny Greenteeth dwells. Oona... lure her out. Play the part of a girl-child.
Are we here?
Aye. On the morrow we go, but tonight... ... tonight is for making merry.
And if she thinks me a liar?
Here now. Toss her this when you've the chance. Jenny Greenteeth can't resist the sight of herself in a glass. She's terribly vain. Praise her beauty and you'll lull her sweet as a babe in a cradle.
Don't get caught, that's what! She'll suck your bones like honey- comb.
What do I do?
Fie on what she thinks! You mind her claws and teeth... Cast your spell, Oona.
Christ, it's oil of tansy!
Ya want the truth -- Ya got heart, but ya fight like an ape -- The only thing special about you is ya never got ya nose broke -- keep ya nose pretty -- what's left of ya brain an' retire.
Listen, I'm gonna take a steam -- Did good last night -- Shoulda seen it.
Yeah, Kayo.
Rice is a bum.
I guess I owe you one.
We did it.
You're a hell of a flyer. You can be my wingman any time.
You don't owe me anything. We're on the same team.
You saved our lives. You did it!
No. You can be mine!
Thank you. You are 'Horse and Hound's' favorite actress. You and Black Beauty. Tied.
Well, of course I like her. She's a peach.
No -- I love you so much and I want you to promise me something. I don't want you to ever worry about me. If anything should happen, I'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right. -- And I have no regrets.
No... don't say your good-byes, Rose. Don't you give up. Don't do it.
I'm having a helluva time.
I get the feeling you've done some business before.
As it pertains to you -- not me. Did you always know you had different... tastes?
No pain, no gain?
We're not animals.
So you say - Go on, Bob.
No.
Have you got a pistol permit?
Wait!
You're giving me the creeps.
We can't. All we can do is guard against our own corruption.
John, it's not your problem what she eats.
I know who you are.
Save your breath for the climb.
Neither do I... ha ha ho ho hee hee.
Clockworks.
Are you okay?
I hope so... No. I'm not really mad. I'll miss you, we'll talk, we'll always be friends...we'll get hot for each other every few years at dinner and never act on it, okay?
I'll be walking with my wife and two children -- we'll bump into you on the street, my youngest son will say something and I'll tell him... ...it's not nice to make fun of single, fat ladies.
That's enough. That's enough.
Mmmmmmmmmhm.... Now, Jimmy, what were you doing in that corridor before the shots were fired?
Nothing that won't heal. I guess.
I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything.
...Survive? I jumped in a patch of fog, and nobody could see me. I hit the water hard. And it was so...cold.
I saw you, I couldn't go in, I...just stood there wondering if you knew. You looked...sad, and I had to sit down a minute.
I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
Yes. I've never enjoyed it more. Thank you.
We should be fine, then.
Now, listen. I want you to stand on him.
I'll find something else. See you in court some day.
In a legal sense, yes. But not actually. Actually, I'm innocent. I didn't do anything.
Are you gentlemen all through with me?
The system. But I'm not afraid to die, Doctor. I'm dying for what I believe.
Are you, are you out of work or something?
...namely a personality.
So how are you?
You didn't answer my question. What are you doing?
Yeah? Is that an embarrassing question? Should I have not asked it?
And she died...
I don't know. We'll break up the furni...
Mother! I'm trying my best! I'm... trying... my...
So now they feed us terrorists. To create fear. How much do you think an airport security system goes for? Then multiply it by every airport in the country.
Right here in Manhattan.
Like what?
When you leave the nest, I just want you to be ready to face the real world.
I'm just trying to complete an education I started on you five years ago.
You're gonna pay me to take out some girl?
You got it, Verona. I pick up the tab, you do the honors.
How much?
I can't date her sister until that one gets a boyfriend. And that's the catch. She doesn't want a boyfriend.
You need money to take a girl out
You just said
But you'd go out with her if you had the cake?
Fine, thirty.
I can't take a girl like that out on twenty bucks.
No, to you--M'sieu Monescu.
No, it's all right. I'll just watch.
All right. Now, there's milk and cookies in the refrigerator. Go to bed right after "Falcon Crest."
C'mon, Larry. Be good for you.
Yeah, but...
Good old Razinin! Is he still alive? How does he manage?
It is high time you got out of Russia.
Buljanoff, she still has those old- fashioned Bolshevik ideas.
We are not comrades any more... we are friends, Ninotchka.
I m sorry, no...
Damn...damn...damn...
No...I m not...
Is Kate here? Does Kate live here?!
You didn't say anything to her?
I had the strangest thing happen yesterday. Anne and I have been married what? -- Thirty-six years... Everything fine -- two days after the promotion came through, I was checking myself in the mirror and she was making a face at me behind my back. So yesterday I looked in the mirror and she was doing it again.
We're waiting for jurisdictional problems to be cleared up. This guy Fletcher's something else.
You saved my life.
I won't be here when you get back, but I'll be in touch. And thanks.
Really?
While we walk. D.C. police want him for assault. Secret Service for counterfeiting and we're tracking him on a string of bank robberies. No one knows what the C.I.A. wants him for.
Elaine!
Why isn't it doing anything!?
Ha. Some wonder drug...
If we still have one.
She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
Yeah. Hello. This is Tom Booker. I got a message you called.
Earl! You said the planes were ready but -- but what?
Anthony, Red, stay with the guns! Coma, you cover the cannons! Joe, Theo, come with us! Earl, you get on the radio! We're gonna fight these fuckers.
I went out in my goddamn underwear too.
Well, see, truth is, ma'am, I help horses with people's problems.
Ma'am, I'm very sorry about your problems and I appreciate what your daughter must be going through, but I'm afraid you've misunderstood whatever it is you read. I don't do that sort of thing.
Yeah, swell.
Nope.
Hello?
Marylin? When did I say...?
Marylin? Forgive me but are you -- drunk?
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time. Wipe to: Montage: Half a dozen different types of hoboes appear and in each instance ANN shakes her head, negatively.
They got a asshole over here. A asshole sitting down reading a magazine over there. A asshole perched up there. Assholes everywhere. Hey, maybe if we were doin' that kiss, kiss, bang, bang stuff we'd need all those assholes, too. What we're about is intimacy. We're about two people having a conversation. Say I was interviewing you. All I want you to worry about is what I ask you. I want a trust to develop. If you're thinking about all this... ...you're not going to relax, a trust won't develop, we'll be talking a each other instead of to each other, there will be no chance for intimacy.
You shouldn't dive everyday, Papa.
What are you doing up here then?
Good bye, my love, a thousand times good bye.
You have no reason to feel ashamed. You haven't said anything you don't have a right to. And if anybody tells you different -- you just send them to me.
Why? You uncorked a bottle. From what I can tell, I got here just in time. Any later and you'd have made the front page, running down Main Street naked, smoking Camels out of your butt.
Don't think about it. We'll sort it out. Now what would you like -- tea ... bath...?
You jumped in?
Please move slowly, you're rocking the boat.
No. I want to show you. Is it ruined?
My wallet.
This is the place.
Keep Charley out of this.
Josie, finally. I just wanted to come over and make sure you're okay.
You are , aren't you?
How you doing?
Come in.
If another fella tries to take that perch away from him, he lets him have it.
So you've grasped the idea. Con- gratulations. Now multiply it by infinity and take it to the depth of forever, and you still will have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
Joe --?
I do.
I don't think Warren would go for that.
If I cut a deal, I'm not staying in this country and I want Holly to come with me. So, if she doesn't come here today, you're going to have to get her to me tomorrow; after I call, promise?
You're in the clear, keep it that way, I'll be okay.
Get me one of the disks. Ask a Czech girl to smuggle it in to me this evening. Put the others in a locker and write the details in a note to Reuters and be ready to send it, if this doesn't work. You'd better keep clear of your apartment too. Do you know someone with a phone?
Siberia.
42 56 76......... Okay, you wait at Dave's for my call tomorrow, if you don't hear from me by three o'clock, send that note and get out of the country fast.
Good, what's his number?
Now I don't want to! I bought all of your penguin crap. I thought I found her--the right one! And the problem was she was too young! No - the problem was--she didn't even exist!
-- last night I dreamt I was fifty years old and Mary told me I was supposed to meet Jill at the shop. It seared me shitless.
The person I cared about wouldn't have done this. Everything out of your mouth has been a complete lie. I don't know you at all. For all I know you could hate Dorothy Parker.
I want you to get used to my voice--you're going to hear it a lot.
Was there visual contact?
We had a flight of F16's play tag with the spaceship over Michigan for an hour. Then it shot straight up and disappeared.
No.
Can you see under the faceplate?
Wait'll you see it.
There's a good chance you could be wrong about this thing then...
...That boy damn near broke my arm.
Gazzo's a good man.
Get a highway patrol unit over there.
I m sure... As far as you know, when and where was your son last seen?
You've been through quite an ordeal, Mrs. Haydn. Why don't you stay where you are and let us pick you up? We'll fly you home.
Is the man who kidnapped you there now?
My rates...
Who were the ones you didn't write down from?
Marc Shermin.
It's nice.
People phoned in.
It was great...writing my little first rate copy, sitting on my jacket, punching my one thought. But I had this historic attack of flop sweat so they'll never let me another again. Oh, I lost one of your shoulder pads -- how was your evening anyway?
I lost six pounds...
No.
No.
If it's too far, then we'll drown. But if we don t try then we'll never know.
I'd ignore her. People can Change, Doc.
Go right ahead. Tell William Parrish how you betrayed him at a secret Board meeting. And tell Allison how you got her father fired -- and he lost his company.
I don't want to get rich this way -- I'm going to expose you.
Yes, the big 'celebration' of my mandatory retirement birthday. You're an honored guest, Eddie.
That we did. Thanks to you. He was wobbling, mind you, but you spplied the coup de grace.
What have you done? You've gotten the old man fired!
Quince, you can't unscramble scrambled eggs.
I'm going to put a stop to this!
The train's left the station, pal, and you're aboard. Would you like to hear the silver lining? Check that, gold. I've been working with John Bontecou all along. We had a game plan -- acquire Parrish Communications then break it apart and peddle it piece-by-piece to the highest bidder. I set it up for him, he smacks it out of the park.
But I didn't mean to do it!
Excuse me, with all due respect, but this is her decision, not yours. And I don't want to waste anybody's time -- mostly mine.
Not to me. Either you want to or you don't.
He no longer roars or spits. He no longer taunts the guards or molests his fellow wards --
And his writing?
Besides, every wholesome thing he might desire, he has at Charenton. A library, filled with the world's great books, music lessons, watercolor exercises --
What is the impact of all these amenities upon his psyche?
It's essential to his recovery; a purgative for the toxins in his mind.
Do you favor its publication?
Oh. That.
Well...?
For sale? To the general public? Certainly not; it's unprintable.
Then gimme Buddy Shaw -- He's ranked fifth.
Without any further ado, Mickey and Mallory...
I'll call you when I get to Mama's house.
Here it is. Conspiracy Theory It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off.
I've been reading up on it.
I don't know. It looks familiar to me.
No. I'll take you home.
He is a porter. He wants to carry them.
No.
Hot or cold.
Last month you wanted to play the violin. Then you wanted to be a ventriloquist.
Cold.
'Bye, Agnes. You're beautiful. All women are beautiful! Gordon is immediately electrified into action.
Thank you.
You're a hundred percent right. They rely on what's-his-name's arm too much...
She's alright, Nels, thanks for asking.
It really wasn't that difficult.
You never gave us a chance...
Eno import. Sigue Sigue Sputnik. Break beats. Serge Gainsbourg. Ryuchi Sakamoto, Syd Barrett... What's going on here? Are you guys stealing for other people now?
Oh really. You two are slamming to Nico now?
I think you have more.
The night I take you to places you've never been before. And back.
I know a lot more than that
I just know.
I can't tell you how much it hurts me to hear that you married him.
He's good at what he does.
...to decompose. And I love my Dad very much. So I came to Earth to save him but then crazy eyes stole my flask and I met you and... well, my dog tells me I just might be in love with you.
Well, that's because he's the Devil. And he wants to keep his throne for another ten-thousand years. Which is fine with me, but not with my brothers, so they broke out of Hell, causing my dad...
You gotta believe me. You gotta believe in the butterflies.
God, she's beautiful.
Because I know something you don't know.
The one who wrote us.
Who is Annie?
Mom?
No...you...go...ahead.
Yes.
Shall we mingle?
Yes, ma'am.
Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
Are you doing some kind of science project?
I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
We'll discuss it later.
Our faithful friend is still there.
I must. Besides, it isn't often that a man has a chance to display heroics before his wife.
To tell you the truth, I am frightened too. Shall I remain here in our hotel room hiding, or shall I carry on the best I can?
Apparently he has the letters.
Tomorrow is Sunday. Nobody's doing business. Crack of dawn, Monday, Walter'll take you up there...
About the plane? What do you think it s gonna crash? Don t say that...
What, sweetheart?
I wanted to apologize. I can't live without you.
The guy with the underpants!
Not on him.
I'm not wearing his pants.
Why not? He has great pants.
I just don't want to.
Okay.
Alright, I will.
What do you think, Adam?
I'll do okay.
Ya gotta have a guy help ya exercise, mebbe somebody to be standin' by with a towel or run errands, y'know.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Y'know, to help keep ya livin' clean.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Johnny Cammareri. I think it's great and about time. What's she gonna do with the rest of her life she don't get married?
Well... well, now.
Don't be a chump. Don't bet any more money on that damn fool shot.
I don't want it.
Well, now... I mean, you figure I'm a little drunk, and I'm loaded on the hip, and you just want in, real friendly, while the money's still floating, huh? Okay... Go ahead. Set 'em up.
Who? Aw shit, Zackie, let's not get off on your mother again, please.
I've got one favor to ask.
Madeleine!
No birds live here.
I am not left-handed.
Would you like a drink of water?
I didn't say anything.
I was, uh, just getting ready to leave...
Yeah, I know.
... No?
You... You wouldn't want to spend the day with me?
I'm glad you stayed. Thank you.
Really?
OUT!
Get to know them. Very well. Your job and my job depends on it.
All night.
Yeah, I sort of thought so myself.
Good! We can get this out on the table. I'm Ronny, Johnny's brother.
Please just try to be your normal humorous self, okay? Like who you were before the tailspin. Do you remember that guy? People love that guy. And don't forget -- your novel is coming out in the fall.
I don't know. Casual but nice. They think you're a writer.
Aye-aye, captain.
Oh yeah? How exciting. What's it called?
Do not sabotage me. If you want to be a lightweight, that's your call. But do not sabotage me.
Ten thousand.
What happened?
Workin' a saw mill. Here's to.
You're amazing!
Down- I'm-I'm goin' uptown.
Now, Aim --
Now, Aim --
Let me come in.
Now, Amy --
What a good idea.
Will! Have you finished?
Did I what?
Did you... did you...
I'm here.
Can we get him to the hospital?
I know, I know... keep still.
The film broke...
Of birds?
Really? Tell me about it.
It smelled of the fire.
That's terrific. You did it. You really changed the course of your destiny.
The zoo.
Where?
You mean it's started?
Will this thing take long?
Will they free me?
Well, I'm-I'm looking for a bookstore.
Oh, my goodness!
What'd'ya tell 'em?
Yes. Yeah, I-I'm kill--
I can say, with the utmost sincerity, that every franc you've given me has been put to sterling use.
You've no right to assault me in this fashion; I'll call for my footman. I'll have you removed --
Love.
The Knicks game? We both wanted the last hot dog?
He was pretty drunk, but I think he s still crazy about you.
Maybe I ought to go out there.
You will or you won't. Don't look To me. I'm going to sleep.
I want him!
SNAPSHOT..MISSED HIM..
ENGAGING THE OTHER GUY. WOOD, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.
Just cover Wood, Maverick. Mutual support, man!
Do it. Do it.
It s not.
Oui, bonjour, Jean... Oui, tr s bien, merci. Dites-moi, pourriez-vous me dire si vous avez recommand mes services quelqu un r cemment... Vous tes certain... Non, non... Je vous remercie...
Wait. I want to tell you more about my dad.
Whole-grain pancakes. And an egg- white omelette.
Syevodnya?
Yup.
You have to get out of here!
Don't you realize--
Are you insane? You've to get out of here at once! She may come back any minute.
Then I'll need, twelve into nine hundred, seventy-five boxes. And that's almost...five hundred dollars just for the hamburger! And my Mom only gave me three thousand dollars for everything! The yacht batteries! The diesel oil! The birthday candles!
Well, that's great then! Terrific...except...it just occurred to me. I don't know where I live! I'm lost! I don't know where home is! Would you excuse me?
Nice one.
If you need an excuse, there's a bakery on the corner. There's a shot it'll open soon -- that way we're not screwy -- we're just two people who like warm rolls.
I'm feeling... I've been feeling better.
Hey, I've got a great compliment for you.
Just let me talk. I'm the only one on the face of the earth who realizes that you're the greatest woman on earth. I'm the only one who appreciates how amazing you are in every single thing you do -- in every single thought you have... in how you are with Spencer -- Spence... ... in how you say what you mean and how you almost always mean something that's all about being straight and good...
How'd you happen to miss?
They were quite a ways off and the wind was blowin'. I didn't have them to aim.
Look of things, she doesn't.
There was only three of them at first. I guess I lost my head.
I wouldn't know. Did you ask her?
Man knows a hundred-fifty varieties of beer, he can't tell a poinsettia from a prickly pear.
Cliff--
Of course. I shouldn't be over here at this hour.
Not at all. And Eve thank you for tonight...and for the kiss. My first.
It was at least as good as the sky.
And I think better than the ocean. I'm serious!
You'll find yourself another rich old lover.
What's this supposed to mean?
What's this supposed to mean: "We have a contract of depravity. All we have to do is pull the blinds down."
Charlotte?
You say that you are employed by us in Fredersdorf, and here you are in Berlin, indulging in diversions which ill befit your position and which are very much beyond your means -- Quite extraordinary, Mr. Kringelein, I think we will look into your books.
Mr. Kringelein will be a good friend and not accept your invitation to dance.
I could not think of not accepting.
No -- now.
I must speak to you, Miss Flaemm -- business.
I'll remember you, Mr. Kringelein.
Oh, let the poor devil alone.
Skinny?
We find a body, it's either Skinny or Stinky, depending on how much meat there is on the bones.
It sounded like you did.
That badge--
I'm keen with anticipation.
I, that what all that nonsense was about this morning? You're worried about my business?
That's very thoughtful, honey. It's just a slump. Things will pick up.
I shouldn't have done that. I should've walked.
There's always a choice.
Lynette, just keep your mouth shut until we get to the motel. Will you do that for me, please.
Go where?
I don't feel like talking, if you don't mind.
Okay, what did we just decide?
Honored to make your acquaintance.
Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
You want to know the trouble with you? You think it makes you a big man if you can give the answers.
Calm down, my lord, I beg you!
Be patient, my lord... you've seen how it is. This girl has a way with people... but everyday we're making progress...
How about some candy floss?
You sure have a way with people.
Look at the stars.
Do you think there is any life up there?
Science thinks there isn't. That we are all alone in the universe.
I'm an architect.
Oh!
Now don't argue, Hildy. How about it, Judge?
I say I've got it.
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
Yes. Well -- goodnight.
What about it?
Yeah. Look, I'll be sendin' you the money from now on.
Yeah. I read about your fellowship in the paper, and I'm very glad you called me back.
Not at all, sir. I have a pair of good pistols that have already done execution, and are ready to do it again.
That is none of your business.
Good morning.
He a Black man or an Indian?
Just your imagination.
All right. You win. Let's forget it.
If you're scared it scares the hunger out of you.
Holy Smokes! Why did I ever get mixed up with you!
Thief, I think, is more accurate.
You're so young, this is not the time to start acquiring bad habits.
No, I want you to see this! I want you to watch me kill myself so you can tell my brother on his wedding day! Chrissy, gimme the big knife!
Mrs.?
Whoah, what a day, huh?
I know.
With a vengeance, I hated them.
Nothing to tell.
For what?
How?
He didn't see me.
Out back, there's a shed. It's just a mess. If that shed was better organized, I could put my truck in there.
I still thought you were going to save me. Even after that.
You had the whole human race pegged.
I mean, so far, have I screwed it up for you?
Albert Lucas Trumbo. But you've been "Luke" since you were a baby.
See you.
And I'll lay odds you got that bracelet.
The Windmill.
Did you say..."Peggy"?
Ah. Luke. Luke. I like it.
No, no, no, no, you just... just watch the road. I'll get it-
For yuh.
This song's for Peggy. And all you others out there a little down on your luck.
I'll getcha a piece.
Do I drive? Uh, no, I gotta-I gotta problem with driving.
Violet Bick!
What's that long building over there?
I haven't forced him to work. I only wet him down once. Why would he leave?
Where are you going?
When Townsend tried to kill me, he said something strange like... "The time of transformation is near..."
What are you looking for exactly?
If you're going to murder me, that's fine... just don't laugh.
When are you going to be back?
Lili! No!
So you shall be... Like our brothers, the hawk and the wolf, our spirits know no master... we are created in the pure image of the savage God that set our turbulent universe in motion.
I don't know.
He ain't never known me, Lula, so there ain't much for him to forget. Not seein' each other for six years makes it next best to simple for us, too.
It's a mistake, honey. You two go on. I'll walk back to the depot.
What makes sense, is all.
...and that extra pillow's gonna be an even three c's.
Well, I need that...
...education, were you?
Well, I'm a college graduate --
This is the kitchen.
Jack Foley. You've probably heard of me.
That's right.
Guys like me, huh. Well, listen, even though I've been celibate lately, I'm not gonna force myself on you. I've never done that in my life.
One I gave him, yeah. Fuck...
Who, Buddy? Yeah. He's a good guy. Back when we jailed together, he'd call his sister every week without fail. She's a born-again Christian, does bookkeeping for a televangelist. Buddy calls her up, confesses his sins, tells her about whatever bank he happened to rob.
Yeah, I got a problem. This is the dumbest fucking shakedown in the history of dump shakedowns. Three hundred bucks for a pillow?
So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life. And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
Yeah.
Cheer up. Now you can give some other guy a shot. Make it up to him later and buy him a yacht.
Try 'Flintstone.'
Well -- I could try. Do you wash your hair every day?
Isn't that bad for it?
No it keeps the skin peeling. You've got to keep the follicles open. You lose hair and the skin grows over the follicle and that's how you lose it.
This really ought to be layered...
Layered?
I think they're waiting for somebody to start dinner.
Have they sat down?
If he has a heart attack you're carrying the body down yourself.
The noise? Don't worry. You're on holiday.
C'est bon, Monsieur.
Merci!
Yeah.
You try it.
Me, sir?
What, sir?
Hey, did you hear that?
What's wrong?
You try it.
Me, sir?
So, what's new anyway? How's Verdell?
What-?
Come on, tell me.
There it is!
To do what?
Wait a minute. Maybe I can help you.
Thanks for the drink.
Sure, you got drunk. That's the best excuse in the world for losing. No trouble losing when you got a good excuse. And winning! That can be heavy on your back too. Like a monkey. You drop that load too when you got an excuse. All you gotta do is learn to feel sorry for yourself. It's one of the best indoor sports: feeling sorry for yourself -- a sport enjoyed by all, especially the born losers.
I told you. I got drunk.
First time in ten years I ever saw Minnesota Fats hooked, really hooked. But you let him off.
What's that supposed to mean?
Eddie, you're a born loser.
Whaddya been so far?
Eddie, is it all right if I get personal?
What'd you do? Wire one of your friends for money?
Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
You're mad at me. Great. You have every right to be. But we're both mad at Dark Town. We're both mad at Hypnos.
Nay. This is a private affair, no audience welcome... Better you watch the dismantling of our enemies... and, look you, see the moat is set aflame.
I thought maybe you'd like to be here when she wakes up.
That's impossible. You'll have to handle this situation yourself -- as a matter of fact, I'm counting on you --
What?
It was a harmless little prank. Who in the world would've thought she'd spend her life waiting for this guy?
No.
I came after the woman I love.
You have nothing to regret...
Silence her! Take her away...!
Ten bucks.
What's it for?
I'd consider it a personal favor.
We hauled her in earlier but didn't have anything hard to tie her to Townsend. Far as the priest goes, he won't be bothering you. Suffered a complete mental breakdown, during - get this - during an exorcism.
I'll do better than that. I'll send you off with your own private guide.
Muh??
Jackie, will you hand me the mirror?
For the mini-bike fund.
Fellas... you know-Jesus! Come on!
How do you work it with the key?
West 67th Street. You have no idea what I've been going through -- with the neighbors and the landlady and the liquor and the key --
Well, usually I slip it to them in the office and they leave it under the mat -- but never again -- I can promise you that --
That's not the point. Four rotten apples in a barrel -- no matter how large the barrel -- you realize that if this ever leaked out --
Just those four -- out of a total of 31,259 -- so actually, we can be very proud of our personnel -- percentage-wise.
Where is your apartment?
Oh, it won't. Believe me. And it's not going to happen again. From now on, nobody is going to use my apartment --
But you've got to listen to me.
A handshake, or you know, someone pats you on your back through clothes. Doctors, people who have to touch you. But not by people who want to.
I don't think so.
Excuse me for saying this but what is wrong with you this week? First, you go soft on the pension funds. Now, you're giving him the chance to get away? As of two minutes ago, you are committed to the tune of over fifty million dollars --
Is there anybody else here?
Listen --
They shouldn't let people like you into space.
Her? Who are you talking about?
Why, who did you see?
Gibarian warned me. He left me a message.
Gonna try.
Well, there's nothing here to eat.
Yeah. But to be honest, I put myself in that position. When I drove up there I said to myself, "If I can kill 'em and get away with it, I'll do it." I could. So I did.
No joke. This is probably the best hamburger I've ever had. I'm serious, I've never had a hamburger taste this good.
Come on out, now. He won't hurt you. Back to your old tricks, eh, Tanner?
We better get started to your house, because the buses only run about one an hour now.
Waddaya doing New Year's Eve?
We just got here about fifteen minutes ago. Ma, I want you to meet Miss Clara Snyder. She's graduate of New York University. She teaches chemistry in Benjamin Franklin High School.
Don't stop. Keep right on complaining. It's beautiful.
What is it?
The greatest swordsman that ever lived.
About Edie?
You hear trouble.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
What?
Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
What?
You little fuck.
Yeah.
Nab- Let's get it over with.
Yeah.
Two guys.
Mother killed the father, then killed herself. Crime of passion.
No! It's nothing! Just nothing! You always told me to tell the truth. You think you can just turn that off?
I'm just explaining what you mean! You can't be an idealist all your life! Nobody thanks you for sticking your neck out!
Will you wait a minute?
Except yourself!
You don't want me to go.
You know you did wrong. That's the main thing, isn't it?
But I am involved! We're all involved, Mom! A boy was killed! I don't see how we can get out of that by pretending it didn't happen!
Mm.
Yeah?
I got to go in. You better get home too. Hey--what?
I wouldn't live in it as a ghost. Now watch . . . right on the second floor there.
Can we agree that that is that?
Thank you.
I'm a nice and reasonable man. I didn't do anything wrong. Please don't make me hurt you. And I'm telling you: that if you ever hurt me or if you hurt someone that I love.....I will hurt you many, many, many times over.....because it's not right to take people's trust.
Are you nervous?
Where to, Miss?
Yes, she is.
One D-6 and one D-8 in the well. And a dead D-8 on the deck.
What'd you say?
Naw, until they hear something better they'll assume Drexl and Blue Lou had a falling out. So, once you leave twon, I wouldn't worry about it.
That's what I've been tellin' ya. The guy was like a mad dog. So the cops aren't looking for me?
I got some money I can give you -
Yeah, well, just stay outta trouble. Remeber, you got a wife to think about. Quit fuckin' around. I love you son.
We do make a cute couple, don't we?
A castle's but stone and mortar --
Don't like the feel of it, Jack.
It's your own fear troubles you... We're here, aren't we? For all the dark magic protecting it.
Indeed I am, my dear... that makes us a pair!
Never felt so cold in all me born days...
The chill is worse this night.
Good for you.
Well, I'm afraid you don't have a choice in the matter. You make me sick. You're a hypocrite and I don't associate with hypocrites.
Not it at all, really.
Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
Spoons! Honestly Wrigley, I'm surprised at you. What is this? Some Martha Stewart suggestion? Those are the most cockamamie things I've ever --
Berry spoons.
What are they?
What do you think?
You did not just say "Injuns," Del.
"Injuns?"
Okay, uh... the, umm, Injuns're stupid.
He's waiting...
Let's see... around here that would be Kiowa, Kickapoo or Osage, if I'm not mistaken.
Driving their cars into trees... puking on the sidewalk... stupid shit!
Like what?
The Indians, Injuns, whatever. They're always drunk and doing stupid things.
Well, my idea of stupid is very different from yours. So here's how this is gonna work. Would you take your socks off, please?
I... I don't know...
I think so.
No... no... that's all right... I thought I knew her... Thanks...
Lydia. Lydia what?
Hello, I'd like to speak to Lydia?
We're living history here.
Bernie -- this is Anna.
Hello, Bernie.
You haven't slept with her, have you?
I know things haven't been right for a long time, but it'll be different. If you'll just be patient, I can work things out.
Don't you feel anything for me at all any more?
Elaine!
I came home early and found your note. I guess you meant for me to read it later. Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Where's Wilma?
I ain't seen him in a couple of years.
Guess you must be lookin' after my boy. I'm Duff Anderson.
You did? That's a lot of hooey! I'll go and apologize.
He was... like him.
Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like?
No... I saw the man who killed him.
Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor?
Who'd you see?
I saw him.
What'd you bit me for!!
Black... I understand. What else,Sam?
No, no, no, no! Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles.
Hey, Brat ! The VIEW moves to the rear door of the bus. Ellie stands on the bottom step.
Thanks.
Yeah.
Yeah? Where?
No, no. Strange, I've never seen Anne act that way before. It's funny I never thought to tell her you were a girl, isn't it?
No, that's enough. I just wanted you to get the idea. Now you know. This house is haunted.
Yeah.
Because I want to.
If Arlyn Page is living with Tom Grunemann --
What's her address? Where does she live?
Kubelik -- with two k's.
How do you spell her last name?
Aren't you?
It's regulations.
Why do you want to know, Doc? You don't have to report this, do you?
Well, as a doctor, I guess I can't prove it wasn't an accident. But as your neighbor, I'd like to kick your keester clear around the block. Mind if I cool this off?
It's just that she's got a family -- and there's the people in the office -- look, Doc, can't you forget you're a doctor -- let's just say you're here as a neighbor --
I am not sure. The Prince told him quite clearly that if he wished to have the money, he would have to fight for it.
And just think, when you get out in a few years, you'll meet some girl, get married, and you'll be so understanding to your wife's needs, because you'll know what it's like to be a woman.
How do you make a living? Your experiments, does it pay well?
Your Grace owes me seventy thousand frederics, which I have honorably won.
Your Grace, if I am so tame as to take this, then I must give up an honorable and lucrative occupation.
In so far as I can tell these things -- no. I believe the Chevalier won the money fairly.
What are the Chevalier's intentions?
Could use a dash more jet fuel.
What, been drunk? Sure! Plenty!
You ever done this before?
Flaming Hooker. Sort of an institution around here. Or maybe this is the institution, I forget which. It's the house drink. It'll warm the cockles of your heart ... and other things depending on where you spill it.
I feel that somehow my parents never prepared me to make this particular decision. Not that I blame them. How could they know? Today's world is so complicated. No. I have to go away now. I'm sorry, Lotte. I'm so sorry.
Are you torturing me on purpose?
I don't think so. I've fallen in love. This is what people who've fallen in love look like.
You're evil, Maxine.
Hmm? Well, I . . .
Oh, shucks . . .
Sure, sure I am.
What?
Well, what are they?
'Course you'll wanna fuck her in the ass. Pussy just won't feed right anymore -
Hey, hey!
I don't know.
I'll ask.
I never said anything. I haven't done anything.
You don't know what the deal is. There is no fucking deal.
The reason why I wanted to take a walk, Mary, is 'cause I wanted to talk to you.
You heard me, goddamnit. I... I love her.
I'm a phony -- just like you, man.
What do you mean?
It's okay.
All kinds.
What about Jorgensen?
I haven't got that far yet. But I don't think that everything points to Wynant. What about the alibis?
Who's your candidate?
For one thing, he was too absent- minded to hold a grudge.
Oh, he's all right. We know all about him. He does a little stooling for us every once in a while.
What about this Nunheim?
Don't thank me. Do you recognize me without the lipstick?
Your husband returned at, what, seven o'clock?
I know, I know. I waited outside till she went out. She's a very nice lady, but we don't vibrate well together.
That's a good idea - telephone the police. The number is Spring 3100. Get a couple of cops over and we can have a rubber of bridge.
You are extremely sexy.
Unbelievably sexy. Yes, you are. Because... you know what you are? You're-you're polymorphously perverse.
They're not?
Rodents of Unusual Size? I don't think they exist...
No. No. We have already succeeded.
You mean you wish to surrender to me? Very well, I accept.
-- Anything, I don't care what it is, just so it's something.
Oh yeah?
Yeah, little election party I'm giving at the Bistro. It's a pain in the ass but -- I have to do it. We'll have a little time to talk there.
Tonight?
Relax ... it was fifteen years ago. I don't do it now.
Sometimes I forget.
Not according to Mrs. Rabinow.
What's Kirshner?
Are you familiar with Kirshner?
Please -- let me handle this. Okay, Ruth, forget Kirshner -- what's your bottom line?
Or a bit player -
Please listen to me! Both of you...
No. No. You've been officially depressed for like two years now, and you were always a negative guy anyway, even in college. Now it's worse -- you're wasting away. Teaching English to fucking eighth-graders when they should be reading what you wrote. Your books.
She's a kid, Jack. I don't even look at that stuff anymore.
Fuck, man. Too early in the morning for that, you know what I mean?
As if she'd even be attracted to guys like us in the first place.
That's your problem, Miles.
It's not worth it. You pay too big a price. It's never free.
Speak for yourself. I get chicks looking at me all the time. All ages.
You just go inside, Homer. We don't need no help.
Yeah. Your parents came to my funeral. I was surprised at how many people came.
Why should you be surprised? You were a very well-liked person.
Debbie Klein cried a lot.
I can't stand it.
David! You're hurting my feelings.
Hurting your feelings? Has it occurred to you that it may be unsettling to have you rise from your grave to visit me? Listen to me, I'm talking to a hamburger!
I'm sorry to be upsetting you, David, but I had to come.
Aren't you supposed to be buried in New York someplace?
Rudy Levine the shmuck?
Listen Nolan
No. Not even you.
I don't know.
No, nothing. I've got a problem, I guess.
How about a little game later?
Is it possible his head struck the transom, or the stern gunnel, or the net roller, as you were bringing him in?
So do you, Fast Eddie.
If it didn't happen in Louisville, it'd happened someplace else. If it didn't happen now, it'd happen six months from now. That's the kinda dame she was.
And we twisted it, didn't we, Bert? Course, maybe that doesn't stick in your throat cause you spit it out just like you spit out everything else. But it sticks in mine. I loved her, Bert. I traded her in on a pool game. But that wouldn't mean anything to you. Because who did you ever care about? Just win, win, you said, win, that's the important thing. You don't know what winnin' is, Bert. You're a loser. 'Cause you're dead inside, and you can't live unless you make everything else dead around ya.
Who?
Calm down, baby.
When was that?
I gotta talk to you.
But you don't know what happened.
Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
What for?
You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
You guys stay on your bellies.
Let me check on Scott. He's hurt bad.
Scott's dead. And unless you wanna play follow the leader, shut up and do as you're told.
If I did, I'd have kept my mouth shut... It fits, Paul... Fifty-five gallons of P2P confiscated four years ago... Guess who was in on the collar? Mac. He salts it away somewhere... he knows the stuff is potent, but the street chemists haven't figured out how to process it. But they do now. And now the stuff is worth five-grand a pint and there are a lot of pints in a fifty-five gallon drum.
Seattle boys think he's guilty. They say the evidence is rock solid.
You're probably very angry with me and I quite understand. But I want you to know I'm fighting for a noble cause.
Yeah, I know... to save the world... but right now all I want to do is save Leeloo.
What time have you, Gaston?
Uh-huh, I was tryin' to think of somethin' to say to you, then I thought, she doesn't want me bothering her.
Nothing on 'em and two cups of mud; one while I'm waiting.
Couple of cheeseburgers, no condiments...
What are you doing?
You expect me to believe that?
At this pace, it could be an evening wedding.
Your juicy, heart-shaped ass.
So you're saying, make all pants with a drawstring, then heavier set gals don't have to feel humiliated by telling their waist size in front of the whole store?
Thanks much. You know what's nice about you, Valerie?
Wow. Maybe you should make drawstring socks for gals with fat ankles.
You shouldn't have.
No way to take another day or two?
Call it a new tradition.
Rounds, what are they? -- don't watch me, keep talking.
So, what are we waiting for?
Hit me again, Mac.
How about another one?
Naw, in the ring, a dive is-
But what about the other night? We were like two stars in the same constellation.
But we had heat baby. Passion! Fire! We owe it to ourselves to fuse together. At least one more time.
Why not? Polygamy's legal in Utah.
You think so?
Well, we'll see about that... Hey, lookie.
Hi.
Excuse me.
Why not?
The City Sealer's office!
Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
Who do you think!
Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
Yes, yes!
I myself am often surprised at life's little quirks. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 59.
A channel. It's just a little further down the dial, that's all. Look, it's publicity. Publicity's publicity. Right?
Seventy-one
Seventy-one? What's seventy-one?
It's a disease, Jack. We're against it. It's not a moral decision.
What channels it on?
I don't know.
You don't know?
I'm all out of liquor -- and there's no clean glasses -- no cheese crackers -- no nothing.
Make it thirty minutes. What do you say, Bud?
My mother.
It's only eleven -- and I just want the place for forty-five minutes.
Of course not. But -- how can I be efficient in the office if I don't get enough sleep at night?
Look, Baxter -- we're making out the monthly efficiency rating -- and I'm putting you in the top ten. Now you don't want to louse yourself up, do you?
Bring it left. Bring it left, You're high.
This is crazy!
What is?
Wait! Hell!..Something's wrong!
Me neither.
Thanks.
Help me with this one, I'm really screwed up.
Mrs. Lampert, I really hadn't planned on spending the entire night here.
What? What is it?
Were upside down!
How have you been?
How'd you ever get away with it?
Hay pasado un accidente muy grave--
I have some friends who have had a accident--
We was by the river? And I hear my friend callin' for help, and I look and she has falling in the water--
We was crossin' the river--
They need help. Jaime, Anselma-- esta es mi jefa--
You can't swear on these.
There is.
I am.
It is strange to me, too.
I won't be pawed at, thank you Very much
I don't believe you, Eddie. I think you're still a loser.
Sorry. You okay?
Let's boogie.
You did this once it didn't work out.
I'll see you back at the hotel.
Okay.
I thought she'd be here. I'll go with you.
I'm just bringing him over to give Jane a look at him --
Well, this kid couldn't possibly belong to anyone else. What's your name?
Hi.
What killed him?
Pick it up, Breaker.
-- Looks like a clear shot to the 'Bama State Line.
I'll believe it when I see it.
Well, this is terrific. Now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. Just go out there. Forget about everything and laugh it up.
You're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?
Five thousand bucks! I had it right in my hand!
Awful?
Okay...okay...I'll buy that. We'll move on and come back later.
Hmmmm. "Five Stars," huh? Is that stupid, Wesley?
I have the key here, look, I'll have it mended...
That it would be a treat to make someone like you feel better... He gets like that sometimes.
Why did you tell them my book was being published?
You said you had it all lined up.
Come on. You're fucking hungover.
Okay, there was a tasting last night. But I wanted to get us some stuff for the ride up. Check out the box.
Where the fuck were you, man? I was dying in there. We were supposed to be a hundred miles away by now.
I can't help the traffic.
Yes. Then he said a really weird thing...
He -- uh -- said he liked you because you looked like you had -- fire and honesty.
As close as a deal could be.
I don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out.
I'm all excited --
I thought it was great, I thought you and Big John would be like a couple of bulls in a china shop -- Instead it was --
You busted out?
Please don't hug me in public again, O.K.?
This is the most likely location--
The flight?
Islamic.
How can one man possibly be so selfish?
We held a mirror up to the Doctor, and -- apparently -- he didn't like what he saw.
He can't do that to me.
I'll do everything in my power --
Do more. Otherwise, I'll be forced to report to the Ministry that the inmates are indeed running the asylum.
That's not our intent --
-- a veritable freak show for tourists and curiosity seekers. Charenton is a sanatorium; she is not a circus. The theater is henceforth closed. As for your avowed friend -- playwright emeritus of the madhouse --
No. It most certainly was not.
You ought to be ashamed, Abbe. Exploiting those drooling, pathetic cretins for financial gain --
Richard Nixon's going to be President. Nixon wears hats.
Miyamoto gave him the battery, and left. Carl's boat was running, he goes back to fishing. But at some point, he thinks of the lantern...
It's so very nice to see you again.
I don't know --
I hope you're pretty nearly through with me, Doctor, I'm getting a little fatigued.
Yeah, you don't want to tire him out, Doctor.
We've got some things to discuss.
-- Did I hear 'business'?
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I think I'll just hang arounna house and watch...
For what?
Get Bruce out of jail! How can you worry about a man who's resting comfortably in a quiet police station while this is going on? Hildy, this is war! You can't desert now!
Where do you think you're going?
You know! You've got the brain of a pancake! That wasn't just a story you covered -- it was a revolution! Hildy! This is the greatest yarn in journalism since Livingstone discovered Stanley for the New York Herald!
You drooling idiot! What do you mean, you're getting out! There are three hundred and sixty-five days in the year one can get married -- but how many times have you got a murderer locked up in a desk? -- Once in a lifetime! Hildy, you've got the whole city by the seat of the pants!
Don't get technical at a time like this! Do you realize what you've done? You've taken a city that's been graft-ridden for forty years under the same old gang and with this yarn you're kicking 'em out and giving us a chance to have the same kind of government that New York's having under La Guardia! We'll make such monkeys out of these ward-heelers next Tuesday that nobody'll vote for them -- not even their wives!
Maybe it's time I moved to a hotel.
We don't have the manpower.
Yeah
-- it was a betrayal.
It was all they had.
I can't believe you flew first class.
No.
That broad you picked up -- did you know she was a US Marshal, for Christ sake?
Listen, have I ever done anything really stupid?
I thought you hated those people.
Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
That's what I just said
You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
Don't be fooled, Madeleine! He fears for himself. He's like a man starving, and you -- ha! -- you're like a pork chop dolloped with heavy cream --
He'd be grateful, he'd take real good care with you.
Why, Jack, then tis your death song I'll be strumming.
You'll have a long, long rest in the tomb, me lad.
I meant no disrespect.
Didn't you now? Well then, answer me this riddle and all be forgiven.
And if I cannot?
Enough!
And how is it a mortal dare dictate to the faerie folk? Is me music not to your liking? Mayhap the dance of death by more your pleasure.
No... I... I need to rest.
Did you?
Well, if Peter here would hop off his laurels long enough to marry you...
Nonsense, it's all of our home. So how's work treating you?
Given all that's happened, I understand. The world is random, but then there's faith. Where are you in death without it?
What a...jerk!
...so I, so I like that. I always like an underconfident person...
Aren't you gonna go introduce yourself?
Or Hustler.
He's out by the pool right now.
Oh, and I forgot to tell you. He's here with his mother.
Excuse me?
What do we do now?
Be sure and point 'em out to me, won't you?
You were a lady in distress, weren't you?
Oh - uh - nothing.
I'm a writer myself, you know.
Learn English, then!
So, Larry, how have you been?
He d come prepared. He had something besides Shiva... Sleeping Beauty . The Disney film... Well, it looked like the Disney film. It was something else. I couldn t watch...
Oh, come on, stop stalling. Grab yourself a cue.
Hey, he's right! Whaddya say, Charlie, huh? Play a little pool? Wait out the heat?
It's gonna cost ya money. It always does.
Yep. Fastest and the bestest... Hey, give us another round, will ya? One for him, one for yourself.
Druggist supplies. Buster here is gonna get an award. No, he sold seventeen thousand bucks' worth of stuff last month. Fastest boy in the territory.
Midge, what did you mean, there's no losing it?
Haha. Right. It's no problem. I love making tapes.
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't matter.
Really?
Really?
Well. I have no way of knowing. So it doesn't matter.
Ahi, ahi, cazzo! Ma mamia! Where...? God, she'll kill me... ... if she catches me eating pasta in a restaurant.
Ti amo.
What's your news?
Again?
Then, it's very chic. Avanti!
Get in the car!
I'm a little tired, I don't know if...
C'mon, you two... Jacques, we have to get ready for the ceremony tonight. We have a new world champion.
No.
Shut up.
...and little Lady Beatrice?
And how is Lord Lavenham?
Are we free, Buljanoff?
Possibly.
Really? You sure?
Listen to me!
I heard he's wearing women's underwear--and he's breathing through his pingala nostril.
No, thanks--I never gambled in my life.
Care to join us?
How nice for you both.
Why?
That's right. Maria Ouspenskaya. BLONDE Hiya, Ouspenskaya.
Don't worry about the old lady. One squawk from her, and she's out of a job.
Not there. Under the mat.
I understand...
No, they won't -- I won't let them.
But he didn't! I've looked everywhere -- And if I don't find it -- Those men going to kill me.
I don't know. Those men killed Charles to get it. But he must not have had it with him on the train.
No, it isn't -- where's the money?
I'll talk to your father.
A quarter of a million dollars.
Of course I'll help -- I told you I would, didn't I? Come on now --
Please help me, Peter -- you're the only one I can trust.
This is the one I like.
Yeah -- but don't make a habit of it.
War it is.
I hope that's you, buddy; 'cause I'd hate to start believing in ghosts.
It's desperate that I talk to her.
Hey, look! Somebody's driving this cab.
Oh, look at this. Champagne!
Where are we going? Look at this. There's the kitty, Ernie. Here, come on, count it, Mary.
Very well.
Elliot.
I'm giving you to the count of three to plop your ass down on the bed.
And there has been enquiries from the American Embassy maybe they are involved?
The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
What if his accomplices have made copies?
There is time. It is still dark.
Let him be damned for his pages!
I'm only going to be away one night, okay, and Clarise will be here. You'll have a swell time. You'll watch a little Geraldo, some Nightmare on Elm Street 12, I'll never know.
Well, I hope you enjoyed yourself.
Well--
Okay?
Who s the money man?
Listen to me, Katharine. You've broken your ankle and I'm going to have to try and bind it. I think your wrist might be broken, too - and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. I'm going to have to walk to El Taj. Given all the traffic in the desert these days I should bump into one army or another before I reach there - or Fenelon-Barnes and his camel. And then I'll be back and we'll be fine, and I'll never leave you.
Yes. Absolutely.
No, no, no, you said "The Number Four With a Smile," and there's no "The" at the front of the title of the album.
That's what I said.
It's a reference to a Chinese meal in Toronto and I think that there is a "The." But I could be wrong.
But now I kind of like it.
Yeah.
She shouldn't done it on "The Number Four With a Smile."
I wanna date a musician...
Why do you think your son chose not to come to you for funds for his photography, Mrs Spitz?
Fine. One more thing, Mrs and Mr Spitz; may I ask what is or was your occupation?
What about you, Mrs De Moraes?
The girl's dryin' up! She's gotta live a little before her body dries up!! You're a pal, Rock -- How 'bout yo' talk to her? Y'know, it's Thanksgivin' tomorrow.
Is that why your brother braved coming here to ask you for a loan?
Was it cash, Mr De Moraes? The 1,000. You gave it to him in cash?
Guess who just signed up for a tutor?
Sure do ... my Mom's from Canada
You could consecrate with her, my friend.
You mean I'd get a chance to talk to her?
He always have that shit-eating grin?
Because they're bred to. Their mothers liked guys like that, and their grandmothers before them. Their gene pool is rarely diluted.
You know French?
Joey Dorsey? Perma-shit-grin. I wish I could say he's a moron, but he's number twelve in the class. And a model. Mostly regional stuff, but he's rumored to have a big tube sock ad coming out.
The vintage look is over, Kat. Haven't you been reading your Sassy?
Absolutely...
I could always walk. I've been faking it.
We found his spit in the dead director's eye. He's signed a confession--supplied us with the suit he wore on the night. What more do you want?
What do you mean? Men have died trying to obtain this information. I will give it to you for free.
I'm bored, and so are the kids.
Yeah. We were sitting around at lunch and she pointed at a ball and said, "ball."
Is that what I think it is?
It's going to Sonora.
I'm an editor. I know what ought to be written, but I can't write it the way you could. It needs a woman's heart --
You see what I had to put up with? She never trusted me! You argue with her -- otherwise you're going on a honeymoon with blood on your hands!
How long would the interview take?
I told her it was the fuck of the century.
We could take the six o'clock train, Hildy. If it would save a man's life.
Oh -- an hour for the interview. Another hour to write it.
Maybe she saw something she didn't see before.
How can you have any happiness after that? All through the years you'll remember that a man went to the gallows because you were too selfish to wait two hours! I tell you, Earl Williams' face will come between you on the train tonight -- and at the preacher's tomorrow -- and all the rest of your lives!
I'm calling you, I'm standing in my hotel room, I came because I have my business trip --
You don't have a boyfriend or anything do you?
It's Barry.
Yes.
I just wanted to make sure.
Don't say that, it's not good for you. You're...
What lizard?
Hello.
Look, we both want the dog -- and...
Sorry, didn't know you were awake. I just thought Verdell shouldn't get too used to sleeping in here 'cause then...
I can't take her with me.
You're not bein' quite fair.
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know you had a daughter.
I can't take her with me.
Where is she?
One more trick like this, and I'll be forced to revoke all your liberties!
...Falling... into San Francisco Bay?
I take it I should. I'm sorry.
I beg your pardon?
That's very kind of you.
I uh... don't think we're quite at your pitch yet.
Perhaps it came to me while dying in a Californian desert because a woman set upon giving her husband a fright got slapped about a little.
Stu...LOOK!
There's a thing here! There's a switch!
Isn't that Lulu?
What?
IT'S NOT WORKING.
Stu...Stu...
She's an NFL publicist... amazing sense of style... former athlete... volleyball... world class... really knows how to live every moment of her life, which is why I should take a nap now...
That's ok.
Do you have something to drink?
And just think if I got her the ring she really wanted.
Better now than later. We'll still be friends. I'm dying here.
Santa Claus.
Six Martinis.
That last Martini.
Just... that's all you need. You can come and stay here.
Do what I told you. Take care of Charley.
These tunnels must loop around and connect.
What does it say?
Pretty stylish digs for a bunch of paupers.
Right.
They'll each be positive the other guy did it. I fear an ugly international incident.
And when, eventually, everyone discovers what transaction XJ6 was really about...
What?
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.
Dinner's just about ready. We were out back looking at the chickens. Something seems to be wrong with them.
Ben -- how old are you now?
Twenty. I'll be twenty-one next week.
That's a hell of a good age to be.
Thank you.
Eight-thirty.
Hi. How do you do.
I heard of one once.
Can I walk you out?She turns back to him, a smile.
Yeah, I would think so, too.
No... this is the first time for me, too.
It isn't cheap. It's nice.
No trouble.
Now let's get this settled
Now, isn't that too bad! The last time I jumped I forgot to clock it! Let me see... Eiffel Tower... Your finger, please.
Love to.
Facing north... I'd hate to commit myself without my compass... Pardon me... are you an explorer?
Is that thing lost again?... Listen... if you are interested in a view...
Technical... I couldn't help you from that angle. You see, a real Parisian only goes to the top of the tower in moments of despair to jump off.
No. A poor little rich boy who thought he d save a few kids from their retailer. He disappeared on his second shopping expedition.
Yeah.
The Mondrian, room 504. I was checked out in my absence.
Flip. You're the closest thing I got to a friend around here. Tell me something. You think I'm crazy?
Now what's the problem?
You're someone to me. You're someone real special to me.
I was dreaming again?
I do enjoy playing bingo, if you'd like to join me for a game tomorrow night at church you're welcome to.
It's a simple thing. Everybody gets them. All we gotta do is call an exterminator.
I prefer it to quot;instead quot;, it has more dignity.
No.
The guy with the Datsun?
Uh... okay... um...
Hello. May I please speak with Diane please?
No way.
I can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you.
That dog!
Yeah.
So you weren't involved with him in his pathetic attempt to diversify? Were you mixed up in the drugs, Betty?
You really... didn't have anything to do with what Del was doing, did you?
...to see you.
Damn, life is strange. I had you figured for this cold-blooded, calculating bitch -- Not that I didn't admire you for it.
I'm sure you'll excuse me if I am not gracious, but you see, Major Strasser, I'm a Czechoslovakian.
You were a Czechoslovakian. Now you are a subject of the German Reich!
Well, Mademoiselle, he's the kind of a man that, well, if I were a woman and I... were not around, I should be in love with Rick. But what a fool I am talking to a beautiful woman about another man.
Any time.
He came from Paris with Rick.
Mademoiselle, you are in Rick's and Rick is --
Have you?
I never got lost. For some reason, I'm more at home everywhere than at one place. So I decided I'll think of myself as some kind of world citizen. I belong everywhere and nowhere. I'm kin to everyone, and no one in particular. See, once you get into the habit of not needing anyone, it's kind of hard to break.
Not at all. I wasn't around much... So why did I get married? Well, I thought it was a good idea at the time. Have a home base. Roots. You can get lost moving around so much.
I don't want them now.
NO! I will not! This is nuts! I'm leaving! I mean it...this is nuts. This is too nuts...I'm leaving. I mean it!
It s not good. Bob Thomas has secretly been talking to a European drug company. We re not sure which one, Julia s on it right now. Word is they re willing to let him buy a minority stake and keep running the entire company. The Global people are up in arms. They say we should ve been prepared for this. We re in trouble here, Jack...
There.
The point was to love each other.
Hunh-uh. Absolutely not.
I don't know any other way, Annie.
Because I said no. Look -- the only reason PG E's even talking to us is cause this is a quiet little real estate dispute. We add plaintiffs, and suddenly we're in the middle of a toxic tort -- with a statute problem -- against a massive utility. No, thank you.
I'm retired.
Off a tip?
In case no one knows what he does. Tell me, Ray, you ever wear one says, "Undercover"?
Git.
I knew it, soon as I saw they were offering a reward.
Exactly. And the world does not need another 35 year-old bachelor. I knew I wanted to propose, so I took her there.
Jackie, can we --
But wait...
Excuse me.
Bad news.
So, I saw you put that book down your trousers.
Hi.
It's nice.
Very funny.
You're actually having sex with your own little girl? Is that possible?
Sure.
Who did?
Uhh...thanks...slightly better looking though, right?
On a case by case basis...
I think I could figure it out.
What if she doesn't want to go?
Hey, Jack? Bullshit. I didn't make my first million until I was forty- two. Forty-two. You really want to change, it's never too late.
Could you maybe not tell anyone about this?
That's a pretty brassiere.
From now on. I'm just going to avoid all moving metal objects.
Great. Now your father gave me some deposit money for a nice pad on the Upper East Side. But I misplaced it.
You got it.
Were you going somewhere tonight, Jeff?
Yeah. The Graduation Dance Mr. Hand. It's the last school event of the year.
Go away, Curtis. If you can't knock, I can't hear you.
Mr... Mr. Hand.
That's right, Jeff. Mind if I come in?
Why don t you let me take this one, Kenny?
Both.
Mmm.
Are you talking to me?
These seats accommodate two passengers, don't they?
Yeah, fish live in the present. They don't dwell on yesterday and they don't worry about tomorrow. Even when a big fish attacks a little fish, there's no neurosis involved. No guilt afterward. No whining on some fish-shrink's couch. They just do it. They accept.
Pardon me for addressing you but you insulted him, you know that. You hurt his feelings. It was just like telling a musician you don't like music. That good old man believes in food as you believe in Karl Marx. You can't go around hurting people, Comrade Yakushova, but maybe you can make it up to him. Do you know how? By eating everything with relish, by drinking everything with gusto, by having a good time for the first time in your natural life!
I imagine that'd be rather difficult.
They told me you're taking lithium, mom.
Where did we first hear th...
So we heard it... like, right that... that first...
Cindy.
Clothes.
I love you.
So how about a little one-on-one?
My court, I go first.
How about if you try disappearing.
Maybe I could try --
What's this acting class guy's name?
No, you can find some other way. Explain it to me. Bree, show me any sense to --
I can't?
And why was that? Did it have some particular value or power?
Which did you prefer, your banner or your sword?
Didn't you also carry a banner?
Do you have a sword?
What, you think the guy should change his name?
Get married?
Really?
First town we hit in the morning, you better wire your father.
Sure. Anything you say.
Okay with me, if you can stand the starvation diet.
What did he say? Tell me!
What? What does he want?
He says you scare him so much he must go to the toilet in his trousers. John, he is a soldier. A trained killer. We must do what he says.
Put the fucking kettle down. Tell, Yuri, tell him put it down or I'm going to make him.
John.
Put the fucking kettle down.
Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak.
How romantic.
Uh... Wait a moment, Mrs De Moraes...
Next time he calls tell Mr Gluck he better be there to take his calls at 9 tonight or at 9 in the morning if he cares about his puppies. Got that?
You've got a lot to lean about homicide, Jeff. Morons have committed murder so shrewdly that it took a hundred trained police minds to catch them. That salesman wouldn't just knock off his wife after dinner, toss her in a trunk and put her in storage.
Does Mr Gluck call for his messages?
Croissants. Like that...
Okay, it's in here somewhere. Let's keep it quiet.
Don't worry it's okay!
Look Kat it'll only take ten minutes. Without Jahn I might never find it... We'll just have a quick look and then you and I'll hit a tram.
Don't worry, I've got lots of friends.
Where do you get off pretending to be my secretary?
I told you.
Nunheim!
Oh . . .
Jesus, Annie, I don't know--
Big League pitchers don't use these.
Oh she may get wooly, women do get wooly, because of all the stress...
Gimme that.
I'll bet it's been done.
And all's fair in love and war?
Traps shut!
Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - - I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me. I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
So -- where do we start?
We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
He's a worm - and I'm gonna step on him!
Hello?
How would you've done it?
She's dead.
I don't know why I said that. She's not dead at all.
I don't know why I said it. I'm sorry.
Laugh it up.
You should stop smoking. You're pregnant. You smoke like a fucking lab dog.
I don't know... I want to be more healthy. I want to eat better.
That's not what I'm talking about.
Pretty as a picture.
Zinnowitz, would you say she was pretty?
She had an engagement in the Yellow Room at five o'clock -- she was in a hurry.
I want to see her, I want to do some dictating -- report of the conference for my father-in-law.
What do you want with her?
Say it -- say it -- my lie -- it's the first time in thirty years that I've ever... Where's that stenographer? Miss Flaemm...
I can understand that -- after your -- uh --
Yes -- that's what I want -- I'd like to tear loose -- I'd like a drink. I'd like to go down to that dancing place. I'd like to start something.
What you need is some relaxation.
Yes -- I must go to England -- I was desperate -- Now I don't care -- This sort of thing goes to a man's head.
I'm appreciably older than you, but my health is good. I take care of myself, and I got some money socked away. You'd never have to work again, that's for sure. I'd treat you like a queen.
Sure. You could probably have any thing you wanted... somebody as beautiful and stylish as yourself, and you don't even realize it.
...I never meet people like you. I'm a garbageman of the human condition. I deal with trash, mostly, people willing to trade any part of themselves for a few more minutes of their rotten lives. But you... you're different.
I swear to God!
You lie, motherfucker...
She's a lesbian.
This time they really mean to stop me.
I must find out what Berger knows.
We have been in difficult places before, haven't we?
I will, don't worry.
Mr. Berger, the ring, could I see it again?
A champagne cocktail, please.
Oh, as bad as that, huh?
Mind if I smoke?
I'll put you on another job. You need never see him again, eh?
Annie!
Ssshhh... Stand still, Annie. Takes what we've got, just for now. Can you do that?
This is a good suit.
On the floor?
Alright.
Apparently she was very disappointed.
No. She loved me. She would never not love her son. She just didn't... I wasn't her "type." She said I was a very, colicky baby. You know? Difficult. Not a good sleeper? Didn't eat well? We got off to a bad start, and she never seemed to recoup --
She never particularly cared for me.
Something else cold -- coke, water, some disgusting sugary drink pretending to have something to do with fruits of the forest?
Your mother was.
I was concerned. As I said, women in that part of Cairo, a European women, I felt obliged to.
Excuse me?
Very much so. We are all, save my friend here.
Anyway, so what?
Junior year!
...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
Yeah?
I questioned Joyce about all this...
Marylin. Run. I'll distract him.
Oh, yes. Yes. About my throwing those people out of my house. Mrs. Pomponi told the truth. I did throw them out because I didn't want the party in the first place. I didn't invite anybody. Mrs. Pomponi did all that. They just came to see what kind of a freak the "Cinderella Man" was. I don't know how people like that are supposed to act, Your Honor, but if that Pomponi woman is an example, I'll stick to simple folks. She just came in, talked my ear off, and took charge of everything. If I were a friend of hers, I'd have her examined.
Dance? You don't dance! You learn to dance??
Camera in the--
He pulled back his arms and blam, I landed right on the floor. I picked myself up, tears in my eyes, and he looked at me and he said, Son, don't ever trust anybody. Anybody.
Do you mind me not saying -- it's a rather distressing disease and the name of the hospital rather gives it away.
No -- they're... for my grandmother. She's in a hospital nearby. Thought I'd kill two birds with one stone.
And, to be sure, I did know someone who knew precisely how these things were done, and this was the distinguished solicitor and former Government Minister, Lord West, whose acquaintance I made, as I had so many others, at the gaming table.
Pardon me, Baron. Permit me again...
Drink to me, Kringelein -- it's my last chance.
I'll take the bank -- All right, gentlemen.
That was my last.
You've lost everything?
I've no luck.
Excuse me, gentlemen.
You ran away because you were afraid. I don't want it to end like that.
Who locked the door?
What good'll it do?
We... have a history. I'm sorry. You wanted the procedure. You wanted it done... to get past. I have to finish in there. It's almost morning. We'll talk later.
...That's an old one.
What?
How about you? Got a Bar Mitzvah this weekend?
I play two hundred nights a year with you, Frank. How much more reasonable you expect me to be?
Hmmm... Figuring out what kind of music I like and then finding me a rare album. You're not trying to soften me up, are you?
Yes sir!
Come on, Watson, we're going places.
So what happened?
Thank God for that.
Peggy, let me ask you something. You're not... expecting are you?
Yes, sir!--I will, sir--Certainly, sir!
A dollar seventy and I'm gonna keep it!
She ain't retarded, she's shy.
Rheya.
My wife.
Told you what?
I wish you'd told me.
How's my stomach taste, she says. Hey thanks for picking up the lunch tab, Mare. Sorry I forgot my wallet. I feel like a dog.
I'd build a house.
Fuck me. Let's go home.
No! You've gone through way too much to back down now. Get over there and do something -- I can't stand watching this.
Good for you.
Jesus, I think her brother spotted me.
And give her a bath everyday, and don't let her get cold. And keep her diaper changed.
Of course! I promise!
Fresh goat's milk.
You gotta promise to feed her.
I will.
"I saw you waiting there, by the gate."
I...
When?
She says she has a secret to tell.
What?
Uh. Do you like England?
Classic! Thank God. She says 'Yes!'
I'm in close with these guys, it isn't easy, but slowly they're opening up to me. Give me a month and I'll blow their movement wide open.
Henry, these guys already push most of the drugs in this town and now they want to move into pornography, right? Believe me, it won't stop there either, next it'll be a church and pretty soon they'll have their own department store or something...... Henry, we've got to stop them. The foundation's got to put an end to it!
That's only the half of it. I've heard a rumour they're taking over a theatre to use for alternative arts; you know what that means?
You mean you don't know, Henry! We got a bunch of anarchists, controlling a six-level block of luxury apartments down on Janovska street here in the Old Town, and you don't know about it?
It is over.
Ned, I swear I knew nothing of this!
No, they didn't. You have a wonderful voice.
Oh, listen, so the audience was a tad restless.
you're gonna like night clubs, they're really a lotta fun.
That's okay, 'cause I know exactly what that's like. Listen-
No, so help me.
Why didn't Birdson just say so?
What's the matter?
... if she can find me? -- That's a brilliant idea! If she's really been sent by God she'll discover the trap, and if she's an assassin she'll kill the wrong man! Bring her up!
Friedman lives with you at the Ambassador?
I'm sorry I couldn't come pick you up honey.
What's a Texas Smokey doing in Arkansas, man?
If I knew, Cledus; I'd be on College Bowl.
Why?
No. In Hampstead... Why?
Why did he try to kill me?
But you were among the British, they were your friends - why betray them?
Is that what you thought? That I betrayed the British? The British betrayed me. The British betrayed me.
Of what? Only God can point the finger, Loretta.
I guess I'm not quite the football type. You . . . look wonderful. You know, if it wasn't me talking I'd say you were the prettiest girl in town.
Sure! McKinney will never suspect you--
Say--wait a minute!
You keep it--
See you later, Shortie--I'm off to the pool.
You hit me.
Right.
Why did he bring you?
I was waiting for that jack.
That'd be great.
Well -- take care.
That thing you said about your nose...it was a stranger's nose...well it's not...it's...I mean...it's yours...you know?
Sort of... Yeah.
I thought you were buying my company.
Good, good. Glad to hear it.
I'm sorry, I don't recall --
That's great! Wait 'til I show it to Bontecou.
Our first annual report, must be thirty-five years ago now, I owned two stations, I wrote down a state- ment of purpose, that one day you would wake up to a Parrish radio station, read a Parrish paper at breakfast, catch our news on tele- vision during the day, and go to bed with one of our books or magazines and you would always be told the truth and in the bargain, have a good time.
You stole her from me. Now I want her back.
Thank you, Ma'am. That's fine.
John Doe Club?
'Round town.
Take it easy, Frankie.
Please answer my question.
Trick him.
Need a lift?
Enjoy the day.
I wanna walk.
It's a long walk.
Yeah, sure has.
Charles, will you call a cab for these gentlemen, please. I'd show you to the door, but I...
Oh yeah, yeah. You're tired. And beat.
Yeah. You must come again.
Yeah. Sure.
Roger?
Who you gonna call?
Oh, I couldn't eat nothing. My mother just stuffed me right up to the jaws.
We gotta whole pot inna kitchen. We give you a plate-a your own.
I was gonna call that girl from last night. Take her to a movie tonight.
I wasn't born yesterday. Now the boys tell me you and this Mollie Malloy --
Probably goin' out to get Williams.
Hang onto her! Keep her in here!
Johnson, there's something very peculiar going on.
What do you wanna know for?
Tell me about acting -- what are you doing tomorrow -- where do you go?
Baby, don't do this. I do love you.
Yeah.....you got here early huh?
What is this?
I keep thinking about Charles and Scobie -- and the one who's going to be next -- me?
That's hotel life. In one room a man loses his wallet and in another room a man loses-- his head.
Well, that ain't fair to her. A single mother, that's a sacred thing, man. 103.
Not Dr. Barrington, the world renowned agronomist?
Uh... oh, thank you. It's nothing.
So mentally ill?
Elaine! Ted's a danger to himself, he's a threat to this mission and his behavior does absolutely nothing to promote peace in the Middle East.
Come on...maybe we can...where do you want to go?
Where? Maybe we can.
Fifty years, huh.
I'm sorry.
What color are my shoes?
I can t think of a good reason for it - for now anyway. My number if anything happens. What s your sister s number?
I still can't believe they're sending you to the Belt--you of all people--never meant to be born, on a mission to discover the origin of life.
Well don't thank me, because I want you to.
It's not! I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the one thing I have to look forward to.
Now what can you see?
Oh no. Look -- I like you. I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.
Yes. Please. I want you to.
Well I wouldn't. I would never say it if it wasn't true.
Let someone else pretend to be you, and see if...
Oh, I... She just moved. I ve got her new... It s in my book in the kitchen. Wait... Thank you.
Mm. Better.
It did?
And you better stop greeting strangers with a shotgun. If Leon s Austrian was looking for you I reckon he d have found you before I did.
Well, I detected an undercurrent.
Turtles -- domestic turtles.
I don't think more than ten.
Once you thought we'd never find the Greek's armor and look at ye now, decked out like a proper hero.
Lemme see it, will you?
That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you?
I didn't see any medical records in there.
Why not admit it, Honeythorn Gump. We've lost our way entirely.
What medical records?
What?...
Long as we don't lose heart, Jack...
Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense.
I want to know what's going on. Dolores told me that you and that scuzzball Michael Fitzsimmons...
Let's go down to the basement.
Then it's true, dammit! I had a miserable time tonight 'cause of you. When the Monotones did "Book of Love Chapter Four you break up, won't you give it just one more chance..." I'm thinking Did we break up? 'Cause if we did, I don't even know about it!. I thought we cleared all that up yesterday. Did that Maynard G. Beatnik give you what you wanted?
You're going to blow it, Peggy Sue. Nobody treats Charlie Bodell like this.
Look, I've got the hair, got the eyes, got the teeth, I got the car. I'm the lead singer, I'm the man.
I will be happy if I have you. I love you.
Looked like two pieces of rope. And your teeth were
And you spend all your time just learning stuff, huh?
You gonna go get him?
Look at all this junk.
Okay.
Put that down. It's dirty.
No sick people in the country, huh?... Just tell me one thing, Rhian. Leon s story about the boy? You just took his word for it?
You just did, for Christ sake.
F-14's sir.
No?
Maybe you're right.
You mean, early morning the 16th?
... Yes.
Yeah!
What's with the voice?
And... does the voice come back?
Neither will I.
Sorry.
Oh, well... It came from the heart.
Really? Hey, thanks -- Heather, right?
Yeah. Right, uh-huh. I feel like I've discovered this whole new side of me. Music is so expressive.
I shouldn't say that, because I'm your teacher.
I don't know. And you know what's scary--when you get older it just gets more confusing. I've spent the last ten years with women who are basically all wrong for me. You know what, I shouldn't be talking about this stuff with you.
I gotta leave first thing in the morning.
Yeah, Skip, it's me. Jeez...Jeez...God...Jeez...
Crash says I gotta quit worrying about him--c'mon, honey, we got a lotta catching up to do--
Le montage, l emballage. Not your regular street muck, is it? This is collectors stuff. How much would it cost me?
Would you know the room?
But maybe you know someone who does. An Austrian, in London, dealing in kids and snuff videos. How many can there be? These people supply to order. He has to be known, reachable.
Yesterday.
What do you remember?
But the small scenes, the fragments in the mirror: you remember them.
The cells in our bodies are always changing. In six or seven years all your cells have changed. You could be like a completely new person from the inside out.
That's the idea.
Fun.
Back where?
You're out, Dyle -- right now!
Is that why you dragged me all the way up here -- to ask me that? She has it -- you know that.
Yeah ... Well, I gotta go.
Yeah. Something.
London? Where's Jack? I had a strange dream.
You're in a hospital in London.
The guy I was with. Is he all right? How did I get to London?
I should think so after your recent traumatic experiences.
Now, David, I want you to prepare yourself; your friend is dead.
Jean, it's... it's not so easy...
I'd love some pie.
We have to do something before she tries it again! I beg of you, my lord, don't let her down... let me organize an escape...
Well, it seems to me...
So you hid the truth. Deliberately.
Question withdrawn, you may step down.
Jean... me dear, loyal Jean... why do you want to oppose the will of God? Jeanne wanted to go to Compiegne -- we let her -- she got caught. Then, on my personal orders, Regnault proposed 30,000 crowns for her ransom, and once again the answer was no. And now you say she tried to escape, and the answer is still no. Jean, open your eyes -- can't you see the hand of God in all this?
Doesn't it seem to you, Mrs. Miyamoto, that your mistake was in being deceitful? Concealing information during the course of a sheriff's investigation.
I said. No further questions.
Getting late. We better get back.
You're wasting your time--she's a friend of mine.
President vetoes works bill?
He works the boats as a "come-on" man. We ought to make a fair combination and do a little business. Jack's a pretty good dealer himself.
I don't know... Jackie?
I feel good anyways.
Don't go arguing with your teacher.
I'm not, but there's some of it I don't see any sense to.
There's a lot of things I don't see any sense to. But make up your mind. Learn to read or -- -- go back and watch the horses.
It never happened. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 117.
Guess they're dull--nothing for you to reform.
I'll never love anybody else.
She's here.
Christ, look at her. You'd think if she was gonna wear her street clothes she'd have enough sense to come in the back. Good evening, Miss Diamond. You're late.
What does your lawyer think?
Do you have a hard heart, Marylin.
You humiliated the woman! Sacrifice yourself on the altar of dignity and even the score.
Sweet love, renew thy force!
Man -- don't say shit like that to me. People can hear you.
You were right. She's still pissed.
So what did I have an effect on ?
Unwelcome? I guess someone still has her panties in a twist.
He knew. I heard him. I just didn't listen.
But we mustn't underestimate American blundering. I was with them when they "blundered" into Berlin in 1918.
You give him credit for too much cleverness. My impression was that he's just another blundering American.
If Rick has the letters, he's much too smart to let you find them there.
I am delighted to see you both. Did you have a good night's rest?
It may interest you to know that at this very moment he is on his way here.
As to Laszlo, we want him watched twenty-four hours a day.
That's strange. Nobody is supposed to sleep well in Casablanca.
I slept very well.
You don't believe me?
Sorry about that. I thought everything got cleared out. R.B. is my wife... ex-wife... Rachel. We used to live in that house together.
You sleeping all right in that house?
Lucky for you. The grizzlies around here only go for joggers.
I thought you were an editor, not a reporter?
Er... Yes...
Hello?
No, that's fine. What calls came in today?
Shit, it's just so frustrating to not be able to talk to Avery --
Dorothy, let me tell you something, we are back. We are so very very back. I re-signed Cush. We're set.
I would prefer some peanut butter.
I gotta get back to Atlanta in thirteen hours.
Just who's been laughing at who here?
Go ahead, Jill, you can say it.
I once heard Itzhak Perlman guest star with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. He played Rachmaninov's Vocalize Opus 34. No. 14. It was one of the most beautiful pieces of music I ever heard. I actually forgot where I was for a time. You seem surprised?
This is crazy. She waits till she's dead to tell us all this. Well, I got news for you. She was my mother. That's enough for me. I don't have to know who she was.
I can't believe she's making jokes.
Grateful!?
That's it!
Credat Judaeus Apella.
Wait a minute! What if everybody knew? What if we presented Malkovich as the world's most complicated puppet and me as the only puppeteer sophisticated enough to work him? We'd wipe the floor with the Great Mantini!
You see, Maxine, it isn't just playing with dolls.
No! Please! Shut up, will you? We're trying to think here. It is sort of like being a puppeteer. I like that about it.
No! But how will we make a living, my love, if our clientele doesn't have access to our product?
Yes, for I wish to entertain splendidly.
As much as possible.
It is entirely up to you. I want the best.
All right, five hundred guineas.
Tom...
I do.
No you won't.
My God.
Exactly that. We can put you inside someone else's body for fifteen minutes.
I'm not your judge... nor have I any desire to witness the trial.
They rival the angels of paradise.
Are you honest?
Tis a fair question. If you be a virtuous maid the unicorn will lay his head in your lap.
When I get set, I'll send for you.
You'll be better off without me. I ain't fit to live with no more. It's just like a lynchin'. Maybe they don't use a knife on you, but they got other ways.
Okay.
Check his kids.
Of course, back then, things were a little different. I was eight, Jack was seven, just about the only song we knew was 'My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean', and the only one who would listen to us was the family cat, Cecil. We must have shaved three lives off that cat, eh, Jack?
What's happened??
Don't make trouble, all right?
Who's gonna make trouble? Hey, amigo!
No!
I'm trying to think of where there's a place to have a drink around here.
No -- I was just thinking -- look -- it's still early -- we could do something -- go somewhere else.
Wait a minute.
No, I mean -- I wouldn't want to wake anyone up.
That's all right. I got it off my chest.
Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
My dad used to play a game. I never really understood what it was until after he was gone.
I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
The game was to make me smaller than he was. No matter what. He could be almost invisible as a human being, but I had to be smaller. So if I got good grades, I was a pussy for not playing football. If I cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. If I shaved it, I looked like a psycho. I never won the game. Not once. And if he couldn't make me smaller with words...
I was holding for someone. That wasn't even mine.
I won't ever hit you. I don't want you smaller. I want you to be happy. You're not. Not here with me. Not home with your mother. Not up in Tahoe. Not alone. Not anywhere. You're what I was most of my life, Sam. I see it in your eyes. In your sleep. In your answer to everything. You're barely alive.
I'll have to pay him back.
You know that great thing, though? Is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. It can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is. Or it can just blow you away. Make you something different in an instant. It happened to me.
I'm not even listening.
Get very wasted. Lose your virginity --
So what else is on this list?
You want to tell me...
Maybe a little of both.
Go for it.
Ah? Oh, well, your birthday's not till tomorrow, honey, I hate to tell yuh.
There were many men interested in you?
Tessie, they say you were the sister with personality.
Uh, how did this personality come about?
Carlotta Valdes?
I saw her come in five minutes. ago.
...I'll tell you later.
It's not a piano. LANCE! LANCE! MAKE SURE THAT YOU CALL THAT GUY IN TOLEDO.
WHICH?
I'm sorry.
Sam! Hey podner! You caught me playing hooky--
Midge.
Forget about her. Tell me where the money's at.
I hope so. Well, I guess you two can do without me. I'll be seeing you.
I'll go with you.
You go down to the bottom of the sea, where the water isn't even blue anymore, where the sky is only a memory... and you float there, quietly, quietly and stay there... and you decide that you will die for them... Only then do they start coming out. They come and greet you and they judge the love you have for them... If it's sincere. If it's pure... They will be with you and take you away forever.
Do you know how it is? Do you know what you're supposed to do to meet a mermaid?
I'm still here.
Those checks take forever.
Uh-huh. While I was sitting there, trying to make my mind up, a cop stuck his head in the car, because I was illegally parked -- so I started to hide the gun under the seat and it went off -- pow!
No jocks? A twenty-game winner or a Masters champion? Someone I could talk to. Or would talk to me.
I told you. I have to go back into the past. Once more. For the last time.
Well, maybe not exactly -- I tried to do it with a gun.
Worse than that -- she was the wife of my best friend -- and I was mad for her. But I knew it was hopeless -- so I decided to end it all. I went to a pawnshop and bought a forty-five automatic and drove up to Eden Park -- do you know Cincinnati?
Anyway, I parked the car and loaded the gun -- well, you read in the papers all the time that people shoot themselves, but believe me, it's not that easy -- I mean, how do you do it? -- here, or here, or here -- -- you know where I finally shot myself?
Here.
Shoot pool, Fast Eddie.
Be sure they got enough water.
Oh, it did. It had a great deal to do with you.
Well, I'm glad you got it out of your system. Congratulations. Mission accomplished.
We were supposed to play golf.
You go. In fact, use my clubs. They're brand new -- gift from Christine's dad. It's on me. Oh, say, by the way, Stephanie and me were thinking we'd all go to the Hitching Post tonight and sit at one of Maya's tables, and she'll bring us some great wines and then we can all --
I only dog paddle.
Veer left. Left. Left!
Go in, get after her!
Good evening, Mrs. Lieberman.
What's the difference? Some schnook that works in the office.
Sylvia -- sweetie -- it's not that -- but I promised the guy I'd be out of here by eight o'clock, positively.
Please, Sylvia! It's a quarter to nine!
'Message from command. Would you like them to send in the HKs?'
No, no. Just waiting for a friend. Good night, Mrs. Lieberman.
She figured it out. I'm sorry if that upsets you.
Well done you.
I appreciate that absolutely. Is that the film you're doing?
What? But you been working so hard --
Tell us, Jeanne... do you often hear this voice?
Good advice for the French, not for the English! Do you think God hates the English?
Did it give you advice? Good advice?
Fine. Better.
Will you give me a break?
Whattaya do there?
Johnnie, please. Nope. Charlotte, North Carolina. Here on business.
What is that one?
11.15 to the port. A maintenance crew.
Two hours at prayer!
Locked safe in here. I leave the scene in your safe keeping, Ned, I have a sonnet to write.
Piety is for Sunday! And two hours at prayer is not piety, it is self- importance!
You think you know what this money is?
Twenty-seven points, eleven assists and still undefeated.
I don't play pool, Mr. Felson. I play billiards. My house, my game. You don't have to play if you don't want to.
I thought we came here to play pool.
Whorfin? Does he know we're coming?
I'd prefer to have our brandy in the salon. There we can sit... side-by- side... before the fire.
I call. What you got?
Can I talk to you a minute?
Yes?
No.
So... how did you find out I didn't do it?
Wait a minute. What does the Chairman do?
That's what I thought. If you don't mind, I'm rather interested in the Treasurer's report. I'd like to hear it.
Claude...?
What's fair?
Two weeks.
You got it! Wait here while I change.
I appreciate you --
I'm sorry? You think you deserve the brownie?
I mean I appreciate that.
And you'd be my cousin?
Good. I mean...
But we wouldn't really be related right?
Actually, I think I prefer Katherine Hepburn.
The Boston Pops. Season tickets.
A what?
Hey, you could get killed crossing the street.
Guess not.
Ain't sure, what's the story?
HEY, OUCH, damn it!! Vada, watch what you're doing.
Very clear. That's one favor I'll be glad to do you.
Besides, if I lacked certain ethical scruples about the ownership of property--which I do not--I wouldn't need a partner, much less a callow girl. I'd do it myself.
Roki has a vivid imagination.
I think you should wear one at a time. One of these... and one of your others. In fact, I was going to buy just one, but I didn't think it would fly... as a gift, I mean.
Ah!
Evelyn...you know the line -- let's make tonight memorable. What I feel about you makes it impossible for me to say something like that. If I don't come back, I don't want to saddle you with regret and sadness you'll carry the rest of your life.
Yes.
Scurvy! Ah yes, the curse of the old- time sailor, suffering long periods at sea with no fresh fruits or vegetables. Homer, Dorothy isn't a sailor !
It looks like scurvy.
So you've heard all those stories about me. Well, I can assure you they're not true. And if they were true, I've retired.
...that s our war room. We did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.
Seven. Really.
I don t think you re hearing me.
See you later.
Okay.
A doper werewolf.
Yeah, I do, but go to work.
VADA!
I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle.....
Yeah. He finally agreed to let us have a room.
I don't know! That moon! That crazy moon Cosmo sent over!
So what? The pleasure of marriage is you sleep with the woman and then you don't worry about nothing. Hey, how about a date tonight, Rita. Let's eat pasta and roll around.
Did you see it?
What, I'm sorry I said that. Forget I said it, it's what I thought I meant, but forget it.
What do you mean?
How do you know? Personal experience?
Midge, do you suppose many men wear corsets?
Tomorrow... the corset comes off. And this thing goes out the window. I shall be a free man. I shall wiggle my behind... free and unconfined.
Well, you know those police department doctors: no sense of style. Ah, tomorrow!
You sound so disapproving, Midge.
But I'm not a killer!
And how many people did you cut up with the couple of with it? Or hundred knives you've probably owned in your lifetime?
Get that idea out of your mind. It will only lead you in the wrong direction.
Well, in the garage, back home, we --
Did you ever own a saw?
Where had you been before?
I'll tell you in a minute. First, let's drink -- me from my glass, and you from yours.
What's so funny?
I will. And I choose --
Then make your choice.
It has worked -- you've given everything away -- I know where the poison is.
You're trying to trick me into giving away something -- it won't work --
This afternoon.
Where were you?
All of them... Which means you have just won a free membership at our store on Second Avenue.
I'm not so clumsy with fingerprints--
She has a Richebourg? Mon dieu. I have completely underestimated Stephanie.
She got anything good?
Well, congratulations Lydia, because out of several thousand card holders... in conjunction with several major credit card companies...
Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
Yes well... You are a credit card holder, are you not?
Get out of here.
It didn't work out.
"Love me love me love me... put me on t.v." That's the iconography of rascism, man!
Rod, I'm not a rascist. I'm telling you to be the best version of you, to get back to the guy who first started playing this game. Way back when you were a kid. It wasn't just about the money, was it?
Do your job, man, don't tell me to dance.
Fine.
Who?
Ouch. Do you think we could spend some time together this morning?
Well try this one on for size. I think I'm falling in love with you.
I'm trying to better myself, but the one person who can help me is the same one pushing me away.
You're glad somebody tried to kill me?
I'm gonna have to get a restraining order. What a nightmare.
Before? Where? Where had you been?
What about us? What about me?
For me?
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is not to be brought.
Well, I'll be goddamned.
Oklahoma. I can get my old job back at JC Penney's. In a couple of years, I'll be floor manager. Oh, you're gonna love Oklahoma, Lynette. You and mama'll get along just great. Of course, money will be a little tight for a while, but we'll make it.
What?
What's the problem? You don't like me -- Don't like the turtles -- What is it?
A new world record! That's great! It gives me something to beat tomorrow! You ever been to Tahiti?
Do you expect me to believe that?
Okay, I'll give here the message.
What is this thing? A fighter?
You know. I don't think we need to do the thing where we tell each other everything!
You fucking bastard.
What are we going to do?
Thanks a lot.
So all that bullshit about God and faith.
It was perfect. The harder I pushed, the more you pulled away.
You must not come here! How many times do I have to tell you? If the film catches fire, runt that you are, you'd go up in a burst of flame...whoosh! And turn into a piece of...
...and turn into a piece of charcoal!!
'Cause sometimes you can't find the right place any more and so...well, actually...they stay here. Besides, there are more kisses than you can count.
He ain't so much good guy as he's just a bad motherfucker. Sonny don't be bullshittin'. He fucks dudes up for life. Hold on, a fight scene's coming up.
I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty.
Don't think I can't persuade her.
I'm not supposed to tell.
I come for the seafood. It's great! Hey... you know what, Mark? I found your wallet the other day. You want it back?
Well, I've gotta be running.
Hey, Mark. Is that you?
Nice to meet you, Stacy.
She left me.
She didn't. She just left.
Fine. The doctors say if I keep taking care of myself I can live to be a very old man.
It didn't.
Objection. The question calls for a conclusion on the part of the witness.
Well -- I think that after the operation she realized that...
I was wondering where they're going to get another tuba player for the band.
Oh, I wasn't worried about that.
No?
No, thank you.
I wouldn't worry if I were you. Of course, a large fortune like this entails a great responsibility - but you'll have a good deal of help. So don't worry. Leave everything to me.
Huh?
Got a match?
Heck, no! What?!
Yes.
Yes.
So what?! I've got two of him! And this many DiMaggios and Robinsons. I was holding these out, too.
Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
There you have me.
Still a car.
I'll be here.
Wanna count your money?
We are. Your camera.
Wait! You can't kill me. Mickey and Mallory always leave somebody alive to tell the tale.
I was dying. I thought for sure everyone could see it on my face.
Actually, they can count it. I'd like to use the little boy's room.
I said we'd give you an interview. I never said we wouldn't kill you.
Just save your breath, Wayne. We hate you. If anybody in the fuckin' world deserves to die, it's you.
Don't touch those triggers! Please. I think I've already proven that a live Wayne Gayle is much more better that a dead...Way-- Gayle. I was your passport out of jail, not Duncan Homolka. But me! I'll be your passport outta---
No. Not really.
...developed between the three of us. We're kindda in this together, don't ya think?
A rest?
Tried calling you a couple times.
Who's Joey Venza?
Right behind you, T.J.
Yeah. But who's not a slut these days?
Okay.
Well, anyway... Sorry.
Oh. I don't know. I was just... I don't know. I was... You seemed nice, so --
No, no music.
Well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!
What shall we get? The news!
Yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.
Thank you very much, Clarence.
I'm sure glad I'm hearing all this now, before it's too late!
Why don't you start being honest for one fucking sec...
Ever since Christmas, you've been different. Kind of distracted, distant. But I feel like you're coming back from wherever you were.
Please, let me explain.
It's just, and I've never done this before, Maxine, but it's just that I feel something for you. I've never felt this before for anyone, not even my wife. My future is with you, Maxine.
Dr. Lester. . .
Dr. Lester, I have a question. I was in that vacant office down the hall and I stumbled upon a little door and....
Ah. yes, the little door. There is a short film on the little door in the orientation room in exactly two minutes. If you hurry, you'll just make it.
Can't a boy be a Dorrit?
He was shot.
I don't think so.
Why?
Henceforth you shall be... Little Wilbur.
His wife changed the channel.
Have I really taught you everything I have to give? I don't think so.
I don't even like turkey sandwiches. What kind of pizza?
I was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. That I'm happy today.
It was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. It was simple, whatever it was. Then I started thinking about the last time I felt this good. It's been a long time.
We know each other well enough for me to care how I put something to you which could wipe you out. So I will phrase things the way I think they should be phrased. All right?
What?!
Yeah.
You know what the word glimpse means, J? It s by nature an impermanent thing.
I ve got kids, I m going home...
Looking for Maggie.
Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss -- -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you? Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
Very sweet.
Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
His -- real -- ?
She was in pretty bad shape. They've done a C.A.T. Scan -- she has some hemorrhaging...
Well not any more, now I'm a serious writer and above this crap.
No you don't get it. Every cabby in town knows this joint. So where's the mystery, the danger?
Yeah, but it's not just that. To the Czech mind, any movement, whether political or literary should be underground. If it isn't, then it's not radical and not worthy of a look-in.
Yeah right!....I don't know, something isn't right with this place, it's all too sterile and staged. Do you ever wonder why there's no Czechs here?
Inspirations a fickle thing, you don't realise you had it till it's gone.
The South.
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you --
I don't want you to be sorry, Alan, I want you to be excited. I want my gift to be the first one you open this year. You know why?
Why Jack?
Because my gift comes with ten zeroes at the end...
I know. What can I do? He is the boss.
What?...
Shit!
I...
I want to try it.
It would help me if we were.
There are infinite worlds out there, where anything that can happen does happen.
You realize that in the eternity of space, there is a planet, just like this one, where you are photographing back towards us. You're photographing yourself.
Slim.
Ok, whatever you want.
I know, I kind of blend in here.
I'll go. -- I love you. I'll be on that train. I'll get the money.
Oh no -- that would spoil everything. I'll -- I will manage somehow -- I'll manage myself. I will go with you. When does the train leave?
I have no money now -- I must get some first -- I must get some.
Never mind -- I'll get it. I have a whole day. I'll be on that train.
And then your stroke came this summer. And you put your property on the market, I believe you said September 7. Which, remember, is eight days before Carl Heine died. And who comes Spetember 7, wanting to buy?
Oh Hi, what can I do for you?
Shut up!
I been meaning to tell you, far as I'm concerned you're over the hill.
I'm sorry okay...we gotta find this guy because...he knew Vada's mom and he could tell her stuff that no one else knows.
Of course.
Nah.
Oh he as clever about that. He called when you were out. That same afternoon, Julia telephoned to him. She said that you were coming, Mimi, to ask about Wynant. He got terrified. He was afraid that Julia would break down and tell... so he went to Julia and killed her and left Wynant's watch chain in her hand.
I told you, I'm not going back.
After our hero had killed Wynant, he got a brilliant idea. He realized that he and Julia could still collect money. Wynant was supposed to be on a trip - no one knew where - so our dinner guest wrote letters to Macaulay, signing Wynant's name, so that Macaulay would continue to send the money to Julia. He even telephoned Macaulay -- Do you remember?.... the first day that you came to see me... he telephoned that he was in town?
Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt. If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before. She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early.
I'm fine Peggy Sue. And how are you? Are we talking on the phone? Are we pen pals?
It was a long time ago.
Our equipment has arrived.
Because somehow they knew I was getting close. Look, it's narcotics... They make dope out of chemicals... they sell it on the street for millions of dollars. They'll do anything. And they can get away with it because they're cops.
Made up your mind yet?
With coconuts?
You don't like coconuts! Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come from? Lookit here from Tahiti Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
What do you mean? I remember everything! Hand me my pants - I wrote her phone number on a piece of paper.
Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for membership in the National Geographic Society.
You have no pants, sir.
We'll probably die here, Sorsha.
Madmartigan, you promised me you'd take care of Elora Danan like your own daughter. She is all that matters. Are you going to abandon her?
Willow, this is war, not agricul- ture!
I have an idea. Back in my village we catch a lot of hedgehogs.
What did you do to that hair? And where did you get that dress?
Oh, you dyed one and washed the other. Well! You certainly look good.
Staring at us?
Coffee?
Must be my wife.
You can get the general idea...
I don't know. I just -- there are a lot of really confused people showing up at the office.
Mary, people come to him voluntarily.
Mary... please. This is hurting people.
You're a redhead.
When you get through with that, I'll have a beard down to my ankles.
That's okay by me! 'Cause as far as I'm concerned, I'm through with newspapers! See? I'm through with stupidity! I'll never write another newspaper story, for you or anybody else, if I have to starve. Yeah? What about my novel! When I get through with that
Why not?
That was free verse, you gashouse palooka!
Anybody ever call you "Red"?
Yeah?
Can I come around and see you tomorrow?
What! Say, listen you! When you get back to New York, take my advice and stay f-a-r away from this office unless you don't care what happens to that funny map of yours.
Listen get this straight don't look at me when you say them things. It wasn't my fault what happened to your brother. Fixing Joey wasn't my idea... .
You had four offensive rebounds.
Well, nobody, I guess. But that Father Barry, I didn't like the way he kept lookin' at me.
Would you like a cup of tea before you go?
What do they do for you, except get in your way?
I'm never going to meet anyone who's going to measure up to your mom in your eyes? What do you think? There's a perfect woman walking around out there?
Wakin' me up in the middle of the night -- talkin' to me about things they don't understand. Callin' me a Bolshevik. I'm an anarchist. It's got nothin' to do with bombs. It's the philosophy that guarantees every man freedom. You see that, don't you?
Yeah. Of course.
Did you try going through C-Gate?
I tried that already.
Mary. What are you doing here?
Oh, I hope a long, long time.
I believe I'm rather late.
I had a boy down at the camera shop cut them all together. Boy, old man Henderson didn't fool around when he gave a haircut, did he, Jack?
Wait. Watch. Here comes Dad.
I made her nervous.
Her hands. Like that.
Just as well. The new people just painted it some God-awful color--
Uh huh.
I'm sorry.
Not a shower.
Is Lois still here? I'm starved.
Then we can go up to the falls. It's beautiful up there in the moonlight, and there's a green pool up there, and we can swim in it. Then we can climb Mt. Bedford, and smell the pines, and watch the sunrise against the peaks, and . . . we'll stay up there the whole night, and everybody'll be talking and there'll be a terrific scandal . . .
So, I'm thinking prom is basically our last big chance.
Dude, prom sucks.
Okay.
No.
His name?
Whadda we have to do -- kidnap the Pope?
Cledus.
Wake up, man; I just got us a hot run for big bucks.
No.
And, waiter--you see that moon?
You know, your daughter seems...
Gee, I hope they don't have a fight out there. You don't think they'll call it off...?
Not really. No. Kinda. He got busted?
What for?
Fifty thousand. Almost exactly.
Yes.
Come on, let's go...
Yeah, you're right.... I've got an idea!
You know, that's real sweet music in there. You can almost smell the action and the money. You know, I can feel it right down in the bottom of my shoes.
What was that?
I want you so bad. She'll be asleep soon, maybe we could do it quietly under the sheets.
It's bad news when you can't even bribe kids.
What was it?
C'mon, I knew it was you.
How wonderful. A seeing eye hooker.
Someday this luau is going to be all mine!
Oh yay! And then I could be as happy as you!
Look, Dillinger, Lee Donowitz is not a pimp -
I don't care.
...Guess what?
Oh -- Well, they're different.
It's not my taste.
Nothing.
Got a boyfriend back home?
Why not?
You a lesbo?
I was just being honest. You happen to have a nice ass. Sorry.
What?
Sure.
No. Nothing.
Well, Gallagher! Glad to see you.
The world of the dead?
Are you sure?
I think it may help us but there s a slight chance it could make things worse.
No. Well, maybe a few things. But mostly just different...
I used to be so sure about everything, you know? I knew exactly who I was and what I wanted. Then one morning I woke up and suddenly it was all different...
You don't say.
I never used to be like this, Kate. I had it all figured out. No doubts, no regrets.
Well, the Hindus say -- and the beatniks also -- that in the next life some of us will come back as ants. Some will be butterflies. Others will be elephants or creatures of the sea.
Every year?
Shall we adjourn?
But the matter's still on the table, Bill --
What an odd pairing.
It's just a saying, Mr. Black,
Of whom?
It doesn't matter.
Then why did you bring it up?
You're not familiar with the phrase, "In this world, nothing is certain but Death and Taxes"?
I am now.
Glad I could be of some help.
My dear Aulon... That's fine...
No.
That's right -- worry about your clothes --
I suppose that's my fault.
There won't be any rest of the trip. Over the hill is a stage road and when we hit it you get dumped into the first stage that comes along. So keep your money. You'll need it for the fare. I'm fed up with you. I was fed up with you before we started.
He's my younger brother.
We haven't spoken in five years. There was some bad blood. I want you to call him and invite him to the wedding. Will you do it?
There was something in your voice on the phone that day.
When I said I d never done a wedding before, I didn t say that no one ever asked. I just never said yes.
No of course not.
-- we're going to be here all night.
Make out with you for free.
What would you do if you stopped worrying about what other people think?
Rebecca -- take these off.
Something bothering you?
You didn't help.
You're not saying you actually... you're saying that y...
Nothing. Let's just go fight.
Morning, Coogan.
-- well aren't you --
I told you already... I'm here to set you free...
Hell yes! Couldn't get it outta my head for years. Still can't. Nice little kids -- nice husband, wasn't porkin' around -- no financial problems. One day -- outta the clear blue sky -- she does 'em. All of 'em. Used a knife. He got for a wedding present. Didn't even deny it. Sweet as honey. Said she didn't know why she done it.
What are you doing here, Pop?
Ain't you go nothin' better to do than to come in here and jack off the damn machine?
Was she ever suspect?
I came in here to jack off the damn machine. One dead psychology professor. Noah Goldstein. Dr. Noah Goldstein. And guess what? He was her counselor.
Do you remember a case -- 1956 -- Hazel Dobkins?
No, sir. They never even got a statement from her.
Yeah, but Joe was coming here anyways. Just go back to Earth and enjoy your records and the Hall of Fame and the beautiful family and all that.
In exchange for eternal damnation of your soul? You're too nice of a guy for me to want to do that to you, Mr. Marino.
And I also happen to be a Jets fan.
Now you're talking.
You're a good devil, Dad.
What's that?
Uncle Louis!
I've got to get her out of here.
Uh...home...
Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.
I don't understand.
You gotta date?
Look at the scene of the crime. Go on in.
Oh, Judy!! When he had all her money, and the freedom and the power... he ditched you? What a shame! But he knew he was safe. You couldn't talk. Didn't he give you anything?
You just can't stop editing me. Huh?
I don't know. Panties and --
Jesus.
I'm just, y'know, passing the time best I can till I can see you.
You must have been crazy.
I can't stop thinking about you.
Sure is pretty.
That we should crunch our hands with this stone. That way we'd never forget what happened today.
Well, that's the point, stupid.
Okay, but I'm going to keep it for a souvenir...
Was it Davy Crockett or Jim Bowie?
When?
Mmmm -- hurts a little.
Wow!
Why can't I let go of this woman?
That's okay too.
Vivian...
Yes!
Now, we've got it right up to where the boy's wearing his white spats and going to teas and the frau enters - how's that?
Now Gallagher, if we could only get a great scene - a tremendously emotional scene - something that would just wring the hearts out of the public - to bring the curtain down in the second act - that would be okay. Couldn't dig one out of your hat some place, could you?
Yeah, the clap. That's what she thinks. But who knows -- I don't know.
What's it mean?
Oh God, this is like a nightmare.
No.
Joe?
Very good. You ought to have that printed up on your business card.
Did you say more?
Nowhere? I'm...here.
So you're still on the Zoloft?
I knew.
It's dark.
Naomi.
I think we should go.
I really should go. I really need to catch my ride.
What?
A Wriggle Room! Maybe we should put that in the Malibu house. Screw the screening room!
Why did you break up with me for Marco?
Who are you? Who are you working for, huh?
Can I keep it?
He's already dead.
Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
No, sir. I'm staying right here.
Shut up and go home, will you?
We'll take the car and drive all night. We'll get drunk. We'll go fishing and stay away until she's gone.
She's coming back. I know she's coming back.
Please, boss, let's go. Ain't nothing but trouble for you here.
No, sir. I'm waiting for a lady.
Boss, let's get out of here.
Then don't have a drink.
No. Not me, boss.
Good. Then have a drink.
WHO ARE YOU TO DECIDE IF YOU SHOULD LIVE OR DIE?
An Austrian.
Nothing. I'm here to set you free...
Oh?
Yes?
Yes?
He's hardly my Mr. Dyle.
I don't either, Lester, I swear to you I don't.
Will it?...
Sure.
Hi.
I could've held off an army if I could've gotten behind a rock in the mountains.
Long as my ammo held out... Right there's where you caught me.
Get out and leave it to me... be ready to leave on the night train for Amsterdam...
No --
With the pearls --
With the pearls?
Poor girl -- chloroform would give her a rotten headache... I know -- I had it in the war. Besides, she's very pretty -- not young but --
Why?
I don't like your tone.
You're no good for this business. It's just a joke to you...
Where do you live?
In New York.
Then you don't have to tell her--cut out New York.
Do you?
Fine. Your mail's on the kitchen table. Mostly junk. Oh, there's a letter from Alex Trebek.
Says who?
Yes!
Get anything?
Oh, well, you know what I've always talked about build things . . . design new buildings plan modern cities all that stuff I was talking about.
How's that?
What people?
Yes, but very well.
I remember you now. Shit.
We're not. I'm helping him, yeah--
I want to talk to her again, that's all. See what would happen under, you know, normal circumstances.
You want to take her to my place and get cleaned up? You come out of the bathroom with your after-shave on and she goes, "Oh, I had you all wrong"?
You're too late, Jack.
I think we have to work on narrowing down our list of suspects. Now I'm going to go check in with some of my contacts uptown.
All that running and chasing is making the sleep thing want to come early.
Beast.
He okay?
She's not. She's got her own ideas.
It was.
Scamming's a strong word.
No doctor!... I'm feelin' good, bro!
You're hurtin', man!
My side.
This is Barry.
Hello, Karen. I'm just working.
I was grieving too.
I guess you can't invite me in?
Yeah, I know, they'll hate me immediately. Thank you.
Yeah.
Mom, what's going to happen with you and Dad?
Hey, can we go to McDonald's?
You found us okay?
This seat taken?
You're drunk.
Hi, Mary. How's it going?
Four massive piers of masonry are sunk to a depth of forty-six feet on the side of the Seine, and twenty- nine and one-half feet on the other side. The girders of interlaced iron- work which stay the structure have an inclination of fifty-four degrees...
A Russian! I love Russians! Comrade... I have been fascinated by your Five- Year Plan for the past fifteen years!
Nothing has occurred recently to shake my confidence.
The foundation is one hundred and forty-one yards square... I hope you'll forgive me but I thought you'd...
Nothing?
Two years ago. March.
I'm sorry, Darling. I love it. It's chic and timeless and elegant and eclectic and. It's you, Marylin. It is YOU.
I love you. I want to have your baby.
Can you Marylin? Can you return the trust? Can you return the hopes? The dreams? Can you just... SEND IT ALL BACK FOR STORE CREDIT?
I give you this. You're stubborn... Dumb, but stubborn.
Would you keep goin'?
Obviously.
Well, maybe I am. But you're fired.
You're lint! You're a flea! You're a blip!
Fine...
You're fired.
But I know you're not gonna quit on me.
The luckiest son of a bitch in the universe, Erin. The luckiest son of a bitch in history.
I was wrong.
I did. Both.
I don't know what to say.
Say, is Maya working?
Bottle.
Highliner.
You know me. I love it up here. How about you?
So?
Prob'ly the rain boys from Outer Space.
Sound like ol' Dell's more'n just a little confused, peanut... Too bad he couldn't visit that ol' Wizard of Oz and get some good advice.
What's that?
That's too bad.
What do they look like?...
Well, what?
Yeah, I'm unhappy with you about something.
Did he say a wolf?
Yes?
Send them in.
Come in, come in. Please sit. Some tea?
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
I couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck.
Yeah, went real nice with that twelve gauge, too. Tell me, why in the world would someone like you ever become a federal marshall?
You look sad, my lady! Let me take you riding.
Oh what have I done?
By God, Will, if you do not, who does? Let us have pirates, clowns, and a happy ending, or we will send you back to Stratford to your wife!
You re making a mistake, tough guy. Whoever he is, your guy s not one of Friedman s...
Bless me, I thought it was a horse.
You live here?
Flaemmchen, what are you doing here in the middle of the night.
Well -- such is life, Flaemmchen.
Oh!
What do you suggest?
I think he's following us.
He's stopped.
You recall if Charley Wade was a Mason?
I don't gotta go.
You gotta go.
Yeah. Thanks.
You're thirteen months older than me, Frank. That might've meant something in the Apache clubhouse, but it don't cut too deep anymore.
Your older brother.
You were at Leavenworth, huh?
Better.
Don't worry if the old lady's there I'll brick it back up.
Is it gone four-thirty?
Just think though, it would make a hell of a cafe, that way we keep the auditorium clear.
Well, it's definitely there - We've just got to get to it.
I'll rig up something don't worry - Do you think I could bash through with that little hammer?
Karen. Where are you? I been trying to get a hold of you.
Where are you? I been trying to reach you.
Say that again.
You made it up.
We'll get a handwriting expert to What!
just called the morgue, boss. They say there's a girl there
What do you mean?
Don't worry about it.
Of course.
Tool? Tool for what? We've been going together almost two years!
What's there to do at the Point? God, Lisa, we've been going together almost two years, and...
You've got to tell me what she said.
What did she say?
Because it isn't true.
Then what?
You're not my attorney yet, Mr. Cedar. Not till I find out what's on your mind. Suppose you get the books straightened out quick so I can have a look at them.
I can't hold out any longer either, Mr. Deeds. Being an attorney for you will be a very simple affair.
Yes, of course, if you wish. But you must be prepared. This sort of thing will be daily routine. If it becomes annoying, you let me know. Goodbye, Mr. Deeds. Goodbye, sir.
Yes, sir.
Only common sense.
I can't hold out on you any longer. Lamb bites wolf. Beautiful.
Entertainment?
Well, how about tonight? What would you like in the way of entertainment?
NO! Mercutio!
Mainly I work out of Boston.
Nobody ever said it.
Good! You should go over and watch some Ted Carson.
Hi honey.
Hello? Sultenfuss Parlor.
Are you all right?
"OH beings blind! What ignorance besets you!
Please don't hurt me?
You won't be alone for long.
I know a great place. ...UH...WARREN!
I need a drink.
This isn't a date.
If you asked him why he left France I bet he couldn't name one good reason.
It is, Ninotchka! It is! He must have been in Paris! You can see it in his whole attitude! He just picked up a crumb of our black bread, shook his head, and dropped it.
Yes, a good piece of apfel strudel....
I should be a swallow! Right now I would be sitting in front of the Caf de Paris picking up flakes of French pastry that would melt in my bill.
Let's forget the future... let's stop being sentimental... let's start that omelet.
And if it is too late for you your children will eat it.
Art thou hurt?
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
It's no disgrace, kid. That spin was hell. It would wreck anyone's confidence. You could be a good pilot again someday...
You think I should quit?!
I didn't say that. That's up to you. But I have responsibility for the other guys up there, not just you. They need to know you're all right...that they can depend on you.
Sometimes it's luck, but in this case, he earned it... I served with your old man.
I know.
VF 51, the Oriskany. You remind me of him. You're just like he was, only better...and worse.
I'm nothing like him.
I'm fine all over.
Of course not.
I'm fine.
Let's hope so. You'll get some more clothes tomorrow. I'll be pushed for time so meet me in the hotel lobby at seven forty-five sharp. Got it?
Not now. Not while they're massing out there.
Sera... you know I'm not much good in the sack.
That's astonishing. Sera, look...
I'm going to move to a smart hotel, tomorrow if it'll make you feel better. Let's talk about tomorrow. Wanna do something?
What are you thinking? Are you angry with me?
I got them all, Mother.
Has Ada ever spoken to you?
I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
I dunno.
Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
Yeah.
Jesus!
We must sound the retreat!
I want to stay with you...
But... why... what's the point?
Ray! Will you tell these guys to move back?
Those aren't my friends. Make them go away.
How much of that letter was on the up and up?
Keep away from me! I don't believe you anymore!
Plato!
I want you to take Miss Lund home.
I'll learn. C'mon--
Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
Yes.
Get out of here, Jack!
David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
I don't.
There's no reasoning with him.
They're wise by now. Which is Next, Iron Springs? Yeah, let's Try there, Iron Springs.
We'll go around that way, come up on foot.
I believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of Thomas Pynchon are self-indulgent, overrated crap. I believe that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone, I believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro-turf and the designated hitter, I believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on Christmas morning rather than Christmas eve, and I believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.
Having a good time, Vivian?
Yeah. And it is cold in here. Hello, Glaucus.
What?
I don't know.
I'm not being scared, you're just going to rag me if I do this --
I don't do that. I don't - things like that.
I didn't ask him that. He's lying.
We took them home alla way out in Brooklyn. Her name was Mary Feeney. What do you say? You think I oughta give her a ring? I'll take the skinny one.
She probably got a date by now, Angie.
Your aunt?
So waddaya feel like doing tonight?
I don't know, Ang'. Wadda you feel like doing?
Well, we oughta do something. It's Saturday night. I don't wanna go bowling like last Saturday. How about calling up that big girl we picked up inna movies about a month ago in the RKO Chester?
Which one was that?
That big girl that was sitting in front of us with the skinny friend.
Oh...Lee, you are my whole world. Good God! Have you been kissed tonight?!
She loves me, Thomas!
For a minute, Doyle almost had me convinced I was wrong.
I'm lost.
In the whole courtyard, only one person didn't come to the window.
Do you think this was worth waiting all day to see?
He's washing down the bathroom walls.
Great. Later on we'll have to get together for cocktails. Right now I kinda have to hurry before I grow a lot of hair and eat people. Say this heart thing works. What's it got to do with ADM?
I'm trapped in my head and everything I love is being erased! Stop it now!
Yes, but... I'm just something you're imagining. What can I do? I'm in your head, too.
You have to stop this!
What? What do you mean?
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about --
I can handle it. He's pretty much on auto-pilot anyway.
Thanks, Stan. I owe you.
This is a business trip!
What a zoo!
What?
What about it, Tanner. Isn't that the truth?
And Laszlo?
And your folks didn't understand?
Huh. But it's still a story without an ending. What about now?
And then?
Things pretty tough for you at home?
She eats him alive and he takes it.
Mr. Malkovich, my name is Craig Schwartz. I can explain. We operate a little business her that... simulates, for our clientele, the experience of... being you, actually.
You? Why I'm sure it would pale in comparison to the actual experience.
Let me try!
I haven't even been thinking about sketching for weeks.
I can read. I can read!
I've got to sketch you.
Madame Bougival; Mademoiselle Clairwil -- and of course -- the Marquis' wife --
I was serious before, you know. If you need someone to keep an eye on them -- after school or something -- I don't have a job now, so I'm around in the afternoons.
Hey-yo.
I can probably get you in there. Just let me talk to Dennis Taylor.
Everyone wants to know where Lisa is. How should I know where Lisa is? What am I gonna do? Now my little sister goes to the same high school. The party's over. So who do you have first period?
Sis.
This is U.S. History, right? I saw the globe in the window.
Really?
Can I come in?
Oh, please. I get so lonely when that third attendance bell rings and I don't see all my kids here.
I don't know, they look pretty happy to me...
Okay, then. Clearly candied Diller.
--She's not dead---
Wow. I have to give this some thought.
Don't make me angry, Peck.
Count it.
Congratulations, Ensign Mayo, sir!
I know.
I'll never forget you as long as I live, Sergeant.
See you in the fleet, sir!
Well, goodbye.
Yeah. See you in the fleet, Sarge. And thank you.
Try and live a lifetime before Friday. Cram it all in.
I can't do this, honey.
You're somewhere else, where?
I was. . . uh. . . just wondering about the.. . .the.. . . the uh, arrangements. Sleeping arrangements.
Joe, cut it out. And you too, Drew.
Congratulations. You're still my agent.
Now doesn't that just make you feel good to say it? Say it with me.
I got it.
Not in the least, madame. But you see, it's a very expensive bag--one has to be careful.
I used to throw trash for the City.
It's great. You wanna speak to Mary? Hold on...
Good. She's a good girl. Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl. And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow?
Yeah, baby, how's it going?
Hey, Barney.
Good man. And is she all right?
Yeah, there's a good girl. Have you had a look at this hoof? She was limping badly. I think there might be a stone in it.
It's cold out there tonight, Barney.
You just ask me how we gonna do it. That's what I'm here for, tell you how. We the experts.
Thing I'm worried about is you.
Wait a minute. I'm letting you in on this, not all your friends.
I'll show you, soon as I get one more guy I'm gonna need, Moselle's brother, Kenneth. Along with White Boy there.
What?
Certainly not mine. Come on.
Figure it this way: I ought to be good for twenty-five years. By that time, you'll probably have made enough so that the money won't mean anything. But suppose you haven't made good -- don't you think Hildy's entitled to a quiet old age without any worries?
Well, of course, if you put it that way.
Kyra's gone for a couple days. Figured I'd keep Mom company.
Getting there.
Yeah. Two weeks. I didn't get to send you an invitation, but if you...
Don't worry, Duffy, you'll have it back by five. Thanks, Duffy. Stick around.
You got something you want to do?
Now, when we get out there, you do what we say or it's curtains. If we say move, you move. If we say left, you move left. If we say right, you move right. If we say mole, you dig a hole. Got it?
We'll all be killed.
Probably not, but we're gonna give it the old college try.
This is crazy. You can't escape like this.
I'm just makin' sure we got everything. You got yours?
Yeah, well if we got lost, it's your ass. Come on, Clarence, lets go. Elliot's going to meet us in the lobby.
But in my movie, baby, you get the top billing.
Right, Max. California, Max.
Ah.
Let's get the hell outta this crazy city.
Forget it, Max.
Ah, Max, you, uh...
Stop calling me Max.
Why, Max? It's a good name for you. Max, you see conspiracies in everything.
No, I don't! You know, I was in a record store. Listen to this- so I know there's this big tall blond crew-cutted guy and he's lookin' at me in a funny way and smiling and he's saying, "Yes, we have a sale this week on Wagner." Wagner, Max, Wagner- so I know what he's really tryin' to tell me very significantly Wagner.
Jeanne, stop it!
Hard to find doors in this place.
No -- just come as you are.
You ought to see my backhand. And wait till I serve the meatballs.
It's a must -- gracious-living-wise.
Might as well go all the way.
You know, I used to live like Robinson Crusoe -- shipwrecked among eight million people. Then one day I saw a footprint in the sand -- and there you were -- It's a wonderful thing -- dinner for two.
He's dead. He did twenty-seven years before he came out and died not too long after in Charity Hospital, I think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed. That's not gonna be me.
Shut up. I'm not listening.
I don't want to talk about it.
No.
So. What's it like having to fuck men you hate?
Guy's a C.I.A. shrink. Here to I.D. Fletcher. They knew each other somehow.
As you wish.
As you wish.
Nothing gave Buttercup as much pleasure as ordering Westley around.
Oh. Well, thank you very much. It's very nice of you. Your vote of confidence is overwhelming. All right. The Princess Bride, by S. Morgenstern. Chapter One. Buttercup was raised on a small farm in the country of Florin.
What are you thinking about?
Fifth and Mayflower. You know it?
I like it here with you.
OK.
I didn't know I'd ever need it again.
I wouldn't miss this boat for a million.
Got word the kids are moving through Texas... I think an ending is being arranged there... Come on, lemme see a smile.
Hey... Stop the nervous cry-baby routine... You're my girl now... Santos is gonna wipe away those tears and make you happy... Come on, let's get outta here.
Shhhhhh... Thank you, gentlemen... I'll look after her now...
Aye. And hang his foul hide up like dirty laundry for the drying.
Jenny Greenteeth said: "Follow the raven in her flight..."
Whatever for?
We must follow that bird.
I'm sure. It spoke to me.
Aye. Said to follow it to the edge of night. But is this the right bird?
My Dad always drives my Mom.
So that means I have to ride with you.
Five seconds.
So put your plans of my room in the trash.
Three.
That's so weird...
After everything.
Now's a helluva time to play "what if".
Hey, I don't tell.
I'm not pretending anything!
For you.
Supper for two.
It's all right. It's organic.
Perhaps it is.
Get on your feet and find out how good, sir.
I told the story enough times--hell, we were just in the car, he was stewing about the fight with Buddy while we drove over to Roderick Bledsoe's--
So I guess a blowjob's out of the question?
Fucking chick's married.
What?
Her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and I'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.
Jesus, Jack. Jesus. And you walked all the way back from Solvang?
Ran. Twisted my ankle too.
That's five clicks, Jackson.
Fucking-a it's five clicks! At one point I had to cut through an ostrich farm. Fuckers are mean.
We gotta go back.
You're saying the fact that you're gay had something directly to do with your promotions?
You worked at one time as Foreign Service Trainee in the State Department.
Eventually rising to...
Lucky guess... Um, I'd feel a lot less naked if we could get outta here.
You're welcome! Spooks. So, you want to compare notes on this guy.
Thank you!
Don t tempt me. The last scumbag who thought I might kill him died soon afterwards.
Shut up and walk...
You don't find it depressing that Homer Wells is picking apples?
A thousand? She's one in a million--right off the top of the rosebush!
Oh yes, I am. Not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.
Well, it worries me. I want you to get swept away. I want you to levitate. I want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.
Be deliriously happy. Or at least leave yourself open to be.
I know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. If you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? I say fall head over heels. Find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. And how do you find him? Forget your head and listen to your heart. I'm not hearing any heart. Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. To make the journey and not fall deeply in love -- well, you haven't lived a life at all. You have to try. Because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.
Aw, you're tough.
It wasn't Tom that broke in the room.
What do you think?
Right.
You do?
I know, I know -- but... just -- let's stay calm...
That's spectacularly unfair.
Now stop. Stop. I beg you -- calm down. Have a cup of tea.
Okay, baby. Okay...
Boy, this is a mother dictionary.
Would you like a beer for your bath?
How about if I set the table?
What is this.
Thank you, sir.
Bob, the guy had a stroke!
Well, now, that's very kind -- thanks. That's what I want -- a large room on the front with a private bath -- Yes, that's what I want. I can pay now if you like.
Does that mean that the bath is my own? --- Private?
You are ill.
Yes -- yes -- I am tired. I have been ill...
This is mine, Al -- all mine ... I made him. I built him. And no cocksucker is gonna come in here and take it away from me just because he to be Vice President of the United States!
Permit me -- my name is Kringelein -- from Fredersdorf.
Till what?
... I was seventeen, I loved her so much I tried to die for her. Two years later I couldn't even remember her name! Let me tell you, time erases everything!
You can t go!
Are you all right, Barney?
You're being stupid.
Isn't it true that later that night you tried to force yourself on Miss Lawson in the parking lot?
Please. Let s just go have a cup of coffee. That s all I m asking for. I m sure there s another flight to Paris tonight.
What?! You mean sex?! Intercourse? You want to have intercourse! Last weekend you said... What time is it?
Your eyes look like silver pools of moonlight. And the tide rushes in.
You know I do. I even wrote you into my will.
Enzo, don't be angry. I was lucky... that's all.
If I didn't go.
Good.
Mrs. Clifton - Katharine turns, disgusted.
I believe you still have my book.
You don't sew at all!
Ah, shit... Do I have to hear this now?
We think we know where Betty is.
What the hell do you want?... Hey, Sue Ann, what's up?
Oh, for Chrissakes. It just means the kind of person who can eat shit for a long time without complaining, then cut their momma's throat and go dancing the same night.
Worry about your own goddamn lunch!
I see you're sticking to the diet Betty put you on...
Very well, Jacques.
Maybe I didn't know him like you did. But he's my uncle. And I owe it to him to get some answers. It's a quest like, uh, Hemingway, the Old Man and The Sea. Except instead of an old man I'm a young man, and instead of the sea, it's a bunch of tunnels under Paris. And instead of a big fish it's... who knows? That's what I'm going to find out. Au revoir.
Come on. I'm from New York - the "shoot me" state. Don't wait up.
In an underground club? I'd like to see that.
Oh come on.
Are you sure about all this?
Oh, I'm running late. Shelly'll be here any minute.
Goodnight Vada.
Charley Wade.
Good morning.
It is. Coffee and fruitloops or whatever you eat in the kitchen. We'll start in twenty minutes.
I know it well.
Okay. Cottage Number Three.
It's probably trivial.
Not Koontz.
Just "lay back, Mack"... lay back...
Okay.
I'm putting my stuff on the right, okay?
Right.
I figure that way we won't get confused.
He's just afraid to show it. Aren't you, little brother?
Good idea. To Peggy Lee.
Have some more wine, Frank.
No, you take the right.
I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
My dear loyal Tremoille, I know I can count on you...
It was more to your wife that I gave it.
You'll have me, after all I've done to you?
I'm through with puppets, Lotte. I just want you to know that.
And yourself too in the process. God, you're so beautiful. Why couldn't I see that before?
I suppose. But they got here first, the lousy bastards. So now it's all over, I guess.
I'd like to be a farmer. I want to help things grow, to encourage life. Do you and your friends need a farmer?
I'm a little hesitant to say.
Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party.
Well, then, as what did you go?
That's not a contradiction at all, sir. I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member.
Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party?
Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony?
No, sir.
Please.
This time you gotta go.
We'll talk about it later. Right now, you gotta get changed.
Made it. Maxine. Maxine, Maxine, Maxine.
That's sounds fine, sir. Gotta run.
Buy you a drink, Maxine?
Wife, huh? I'd love to meet her, Craig.
Dr. Lester, it's been really fascinating, but I'm afraid I have to get home to my wife now.
Shall we say dinner on Friday. Just the two of us? You can come too if you like, Schwartz.
Yeah. But enough about me.
I'll see you then...I look forward to it.
I have a few people here, I can't really chat right now.
I wasn't sure you caught that.
No ... Have you ever been in Vienna?
Sure -- take him to the vet.
No thanks.
Yeah.
Rob. Rob Gordon. Circa junior high...
It's not my dog and this Simon seems to have enough on his mind -- but he did throw up twice and his spark is off.
No--it's comedy they want, Will! Comedy! Like Romeo and Ethel?
Call me "sir," Harold. First thing you learn in the Army - an officer deserves your respect.
Because he likes you.
Elliot lusts after you.
Yeah.
...or films you must see or...
He waved to you?
Hey, you guys are wearin' white. It must be in the stars.
Uri Geller must be on the premises someplace.
Yeah. Right.
We just need about six weeks, in about six weeks we could cut a whole album.
We're gonna operate together.
Just about.
Morgan blood. The beat in Nevada. Clay and me have a place on the Toulomne River. We're going to raise horses like these.
I've got eleven horses.
Did you ever try taking a bunch of horses over Sonora Pass? It's quite a job.
Maybe, but someone's got to make a stand.
No I'm not, I came to Prague looking for something - this could be it!
What we need is a space for real performance art. A cultural exchange for radical expressionism.
Thank you for loving me.
These guys think the West is just MTV and Hollywood movies. We've got to show them there's more to it.
I'd like to be. Sailing on the Progress?
Progress! It always arrives too late!
How's he supposed to see the wire?
He knows.
How the fuck could he know?
You don't mean?
Sorry.
Guts! A crummy pigeon who's looking to get his neck wrung! You should have You should have known better than to trust this punched out brother of yours. He was all right hanging around for laughs. But this is business. I don't like goofoffs messing in our business.
Coffee?
I bet that's exactly what she tells herself! But you and I both know she's just a dried-up bitter old maid. Say, how about you and I grab a little dinner and a show after work? I was thinking maybe The King and I --
C mon.
That s my piece. I was saving it because I got nauseated from that store bought chicken.
Long, boring, and generally pretty sad. Arnie seemed to enjoy it... Hey, where s that chocolate cake...?
No. It's the inner light. And with it we can defeat anything you've got.
Adrian, I'm asking you nicely, in the name of all that is good: release my friends and get in the flask.
Yes.
So...?
Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
No other aspiration?
Why do you think I keep her here?
You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
For Her Majesty.
I said. I serve the Queen.
But yourself? What about John Brown?
She don't look no worse to me.
Ya got a good mind for dates.
That's a lie!!
I never saw him before!
When did you deliver this first?
Ya got heart.
She's done well for herself--on her own and all--
Most people did, yeah.
Yeah.
There was a faction pulling for that boy who was killed in the Gulf War-- Ruben--
Thanks.
She killed him.
Did you find out about her parents?
You know I'm whacko, Sam, what'd you find?
Catherine Tramell. It's part of her game.
Yes, I'd...I-I-I'd love, I'd love to get you this.
Oh, yes. Who doesn't? Look!
e.e. cummings. I'd like to get you this.
How-how's Frederick?
I-I read a poem of you and thought of his last week. A poem of his and thought of you last-- You'll be fine, though. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. She looks at the book.
Oh, oh, yes. I-I-I-'d like to, uh, uh, very much.
I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
No wait. Wait.
Well why do you -- why do you think that?
Well, wait.
Then maybe this isn't what he wants, but this what he was hoping for. Maybe it's what I want.
This is what he wants.
Oh. Well, I don't. Shall I tell you what I do?
Among others.
Yeah?
There we cannot help you.
I have a present for you. I didn't quite know what to get you -- anyway it's a little awkward for me, shopping -- -- so here's a hundred dollars -- go out and buy yourself something.
Okay, okay, Fran. I deserve that. But just ask yourself -- why does a man run around with a lot of girls? Because he's unhappy at home -- because he's lonely, that's why -- all that was before you, Fran -- I've stopped running.
Now, Fran --
Oh. Our friend from the Chinese restaurant. Thanks, Fran. We better keep it here.
It's Christmas Eve, Fran -- let's not fight.
True, but that's hardly common knowledge, is it? Thank you. Now, there may be problems once we're inside.
You say I am a crook.
I know it!
What's he got that I haven't got?
You're crazy! You're really out of your mind!
Why?
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed fox head on a spear as their symbol?
That's a wolf's head.
Rendezvous in Rome starring Jack Goodman and Debbie Klein. The love affair that shocked Europe! See torrid lovemaking at its most explicit! See Jack and Debbie expose their lust in the sacred halls of the Vatican! Never has the screen dared...
If you don't stop, I'm going to kill you.
I have to make love to her. It's very simple. She has no choice really.
It just fascinates me that you can spend so much energy on someone so dull.
It is impossible for a body like that to be dull.
We've known Debbie what, since the eighth grade? How many years of foreplay is that?
She says she 'likes me too much'.
The Slaughtered Lamb?
No, not again.
No! I've got...reserve reserves!
Would you describe their position as inflexible?
Yes. Exactly. Major Rufus.
Duh. Tom Cruise. "Risky Business".
I've done no television whatsoever. No.
I know.
You're jabbing at me. 112.
What?
Mm.
Mm.
I am.
No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.
That's what Mr. Miyamoto reported, and he'd have no reason to lie. He couldn't know that it would help his case.
Now you believe there were two lanterns when defendant arrived. One in Carl's hand. The second lashed to the mast.
To my father. Everything counts.
Well. It shows the prosecutor was wrong. It was Carl's boat that was dead in the water. Or he'd never have put up the lantern.
Tell us why that lantern would be so significant.
Very good, Mary--
And that was the last time you saw him?
Stop eyeballing me, mister! I've looked through your file and done a little checking, and I know it all. I know about your mother. I know your old man's an alcoholic and a whore chaser. Life sure has dealt you some shitty cards! Hasn't it, Mayo?
I'm doing okay, sir.
Get into your fatigues, Mayo. Before the weekend's out, you'll quit.
I want your D.O.R.
No, sir. You can kick me out, but I'm not quitting.
No, sir! It was the hardest thing I ever did, sir! Until this.
That's a lie, Mayo. You've gone through a lot worse, haven't you?
She may not make it through the program, but she's got more heart and more character than you'll ever have. I've seen your college record. I've never heard of most of those schools. Tell me something, Mayo. Did you buy that degree?
Yes it is, cause then he'll give you all A's and it won't be fair.
This island of yours sounds like a kind of unpredictable place.
Call me Johnnie... N.O. has always been a good town to sit around in.
Hasta siempre.
How's that?
What about it?
I thought it was a nice place. Isn't it?
Yes, sir.
Hey, Sam...
What's that, Sam?
...I want to say a thing.
Could you tell me what 'kendo' is?
You were hatching ideas, making plans, arriving at decisions, right?
I guess so.
So you understand the concept then. When you're busy here, your work, what your task is, is being executed elsewhere.
Of course.
When you were shaving this morning, you weren't just shaving, right?
What do you mean?
Sun's coming up ... We've been in the fog for six hours.
Eve, I'm sorry.
But, Eve, I would--
It certainly is. I agree with you completely.
I could always get us a bottle.
Your sister here?
Where ya goin?
And why would I do that?
Hey, whatsa matter with a bank account, anyway?
Hey, did yuh get a load of the bedroom?
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel. Fifty bucks ain't going to ruin me.
Dad, I was talking to Jessica about reincarnation, and she thinks that probably you knew Annie in another life.
Victoria? She's okay.
Jonah, this isn't fair. You don't know Victoria. I hardly know her myself. She is, in fact, a mystery to me. She tosses her hair a lot. Why does she do this? I have no idea. Is it a twitch? Does she need a haircut? Should she use barrette so it doesn't keep falling in her face? These are things that I'm willing to get to the bottom of, and that is why I am dating her. That is all I am doing. I am not marrying her. Can you appreciate the difference? That's what single people do, they try people on and they see if they fit. But nobody fits perfectly, everyone is an adjustment.
Sure. Sure.
Was Mom an adjustment?
They're not that dumb, after all.
But you knew, that day, that I wouldn't be able to follow you didn't you. Who was at the top when you got there? Elster? With his wife?
Jeet Kune Do...Now I did some research on that form of fighting, and I found out that Jeet Kune Do was a style developed by Bruce Lee. Did you know that?
Wait a minute--
-Look. You want to kill a Good Guy, but not be a Bad Guy, you wait until a Bad Guy kills the Good Guy, and then you come in and kill the Bad Guy, and then you're the Good Guy.
So if we do his job, we're the bad guys. If we do our job, we're the good guys.
I want two eggs poached, hash brown well-done. English muffin for the bread. And a coffee.
Nice job.
Male, 40 to 50 years old, five-foot- eleven, chewed tobacco--then we get into the dental records--
You'll be a lot sorrier before we're through with you.
I sympathize with your problem -- and believe me, I'm very sorry --
That the word on our boy?
Yeah, this is Skinny.
Gonna pull a lot of jobs out of this county.
Yeah, we'll have folks swimming over to Mexico to work in the sweatshops.
Oh, I'm very grateful.
Baxter, we're a little disappointed in you -- gratitude-wise.
Well, after all, it's my apartment -- it's private property -- it's not a public playground.
We went to bat for you -- and now you won't play ball with us.
God...I think I'm gonna be sick--
She did?
What?
Don't you know I'm having a tough time keeping my eyes off of you?
No -- I guess not.
What would you like me to say -- that a pretty girl with an outrageous manner means more to an old pro like me than a quarter of a million dollars?
All that marvelous rejection -- you knew I couldn't resist it. Now it turns out you were only interested in the money.
I mean back in college, you were a very pretty girl, there s no question about that. But this... ...you ve really grown into a beautiful woman...
Hanging is nice. Never goes out of style. What about hare-kare - a taste of the Orient? But no! You're in Paris! Try the Guillotine! There's one in the Louvre!
Oh give me a break! He could use pills back in America! Why not get a little culture?
Look, I didn't mean to hurt anybody... God, I didn't mean to... to...
Let's face it. It's a, how do you say... mother-fucker. But we're all in it together. That's why we're trying to help you.
Merde! Just missed!
Nothing.
Some of the smartest robberies have taken place aboard ships--
Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum. Then I'm coming back here and go to college and see what they know . . . and then I'm going to build things. I'm gonna build air fields. I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. I'm gonna build bridges a mile long . . .
In that place?
Well how did it happen?
But I thought you -- I guess you kind of lost interest in it over the years then.
Art?
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson. Now what was your major subject at college?
I mean did he take you up to his room with him? Did you go to a hotel?
Momma... are they angry with us.
I'm sorry. I can't lend you any money.
Really? That'll be terrific for him, I think.
Oh!
Let me get a little reaction here. How's Elliot?
Yeah? Yeah? Okay, kids, you can open the presents now.
Do you know a friendly cop?
You did this to yourself. You said "fewer clients." You put it all on paper. Scully was very upset. Heart attacks make some people sweeter, but not him. You did this to yourself --
All I said was, I don't want to perform abortions. I have no argument with you performing them.
Uh... they said... they will think about it.
He known who it was onnacouna the tire tracks in the dirt from the back of the garage to where they loaded up. "Old Fishbait," he says, "never lifted a thing in this world if there was a way he could roll it."
How's your love life, Midge?
It is beautiful.
Well, yeah, thank you, but --
I know.
I've never run across one like that.
Do you even know these kids?
Have you been there?
I know. It sucks. I suck.
You don't like her because you were involved with Mr. Marsh before she came along. Isn't that true?
Have you been to any parties?
If there is anything we can do for you...
This is where the stories are. You are going to become friends with these people. You are going to party with them. You are going to hang out with them on weekends. When they go to prom, you are going to be in their same damn limo!
From his landlord -- once a month.
You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
Staying the night here, uninvited.
The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
See you replaced a mooring line, lately. This one's new.
What's up, where you going?
You can always tell how much a man's traveled by the way he plays shuffle-board.
Yeah--if he'd only stick to shuffle-board.
And Buddy was one of them.
Yes, yes--the air-- --I'm getting plenty of air. Miss Marsh--Mrs. Rosson.
And she's a knock-out, too.
What's the name of it?
You say it's straight ahead a mile?
You ready for this?
Thanks.
I can back it up.
I'd like to do that.
Well, it looks like we both lucked out. I just met somebody myself. Somebody my aunt introduced me to.
Well, I obviously do. And I also know that Leon s not here, Rhian. But I thought that you might know where I should look for him.
Not really.
Fucked-up fucking weird.
So I'm part-Indian?
These are our people. There were Paynes in Florida, Oklahoma, Piedras Negras--couple of 'em won the whatsit-- Congressional Medal Of Honor--
He's still pissed off about it.
So how come you got into all this?
When you're his age you'll still be pissed off about him.
Public Display of Affection. Every time he moves up a rank, it's like he's got to tighten the screws a little more--
PDA?
I mean, just 'cause he didn't--you know--
Hey. You. Mr. Coma.
What the hell happened to you guys?
Pardon me?
Then don't.
Now!
Got a casualty list?
All accounted for? Where's Penny?
And ask the American taxpayer to foot the bill? No way. Send 'em back to the Eighth Dimension as soon as we find the Overthruster. It wasn't in Penny's purse...so if we have to run this joint upside down and inside out...
Not at all.
I've got to go.
Thank you very much, sir.
You do?
Because I wouldn't want you to do it unless you really wanted to!
You sure you really want to?
During the day? We'll go for a drive or something.
You're Terry Malloy, aren't you?
It's strange isn't it? I mean it's not a piano, it doesn't make any sound.
No --
I'm fine. Come on, Beth! You know I'm fine! How the hell long do I have to keep doing this?
It's bullshit. You know it is.
Things are fine. I told you. They're fine.
My sex life is fine. My sex life is pretty shitty actually since I stopped seeing you -- maybe I should think about my Electrolux again.
Joe knows what you're saying, just being polite --
It won't happen again. Scout's honor.
I suppose we can bring it down a little.
No. We are not supposed to be backing you up.
If you re into that kind of conspicuous consumption...
It's okay--I don't mind.
I'm sorry. They're not used to seeing a car like this.
Then what is it?
We got that dedication tomorrow. This is a hell of a time to be draggin' up old business.
You ever hear of something called The Bible?
Once, in church, dude.
Yeah, well anyway...I thought you might have some advice, brother to brother. I mean, I think tonight she might, we might really, there's a chance that -- you know.
What? Not the Bible?
Does it tell me how to get laid?
Ready for what?
Come on, come on. Here they come, Gallagher! Here they come!
What-what-what-what's the matter?
You? You kiddin'? If the Gestapo would take away your Bloomingdale's charge card, you'd tell 'em everything.
Yeah, 'cause it's supposed to.
Was what worth it?
Boy, those guys in the French Resistance were really brave, you know? Got to listen to Maurice Chevalier sing so much.
Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail?
No, no. The three hundred is for you doing it to me.
That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song.
I am now, sir.
Not dollars. Pounds.
What are you, a mind reader or something?
Oh, no.
Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
Suicide.
Very good. You're obviously mechanical.
If you can figure it out, be my guest.
Then you won't make it.
Thank you.
Neither did I.
I never said I didn't.
I can't stay here.
Hey, bad throat, huh J-man?
Eighteen? Why, it was only last year you were seventeen.
Five years of it. Surely, you d have divorced him if he disgusted you?
Hot dog! Just like an organ.
I don't know. Maybe I will say it. How old are you anyway?
Of course.
Right, I'll get your door. I tend to fade in and out lately.
You what?
Oh... well, maybe we better synchronize our spells... or stagger them.
Well ... ... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.
-- power too -- promise me that --
-- offer me everything I ask for --
Hell, no, belongs to my girl's sister. The sister's been over to New Orleans, lets us have it while she's gone. Where's that pretty little lady of yours today?
This your car?
-- offer me money --
Let's go by Rosarita's. You been there yet?
That'd be fine, Bobby.
Thought maybe Sparky and Buddy'd taken ya. Come on, I'll drive.
No, haven't heard of it.
Need a hand?
How 'bout a beer?
Thanks, Bobby, 'bout done.
Why is that, do you think?
Wait, Jack.
We'll never find the Baron's castle.
Plato!
... and my crown doesn't fit and... Really??
Ah, Jeanne... come here...! This whole coronation idea of yours is a fiasco... nothing is ready...
We weren't below for more than ten seconds. There was no danger. I had the shot. I took it.
Well what did she say?
The rules of engagement are not flexible. They exist for your safety. You will obey them. Is that clear?
Why?
I think he's jealous of Havel.
She's in love.
Jesus. How'd you know about Snoopy?
I mean I'm not stealing the fucking car.
Define your terms.
It is customary to write first, and request an appointment --
I haven't used anything for two days. I'm trying.
Jesus, I don't believe it.
Sheriff, may I present a pair of Fellow sophisticates, Turkey Creek Jack Johnson and Texas Jack Vermillion? Watch your ear, Creek.
What needs clearing up?
What's the apartment house number?
Okay, Lisa -- probably you're right. He's probably in the bedroom now, entertaining his wife with the indian rope trick. I'll admit to criminal insanity. Now when do I start the cure?
To get on home.
Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
-- We might as well be frank, Monsieur. It will take a miracle to get you out of Casablanca. And the Germans have outlawed miracles.
As leader of all illegal activities in Casablanca, I am an influential and respected man. It would not be worth my life to do anything for Monsieur Laszlo. You, however, are a different matter.
You see, my dear, the word has gone around.
Signor Ferrari thinks it might just be possible to get an exit visa for you.
I will stay here and keep on trying. I'm sure in a little while --
Yo, what's with you? -- It was suppose to be private.
I thought I was doin' ya a favor -- C'mon inside -- Y'know, my sister really likes ya.
Whatta these guys want?
To see ya train.
No.
We found a body out by the Army base yesterday. Been there for a long time.
When do I get to Lathrop Wells?
Charley? I believe he was. Used to go for lodge meetings over to Laredo. What's he got to do with your body?
Can I have the gun?
Glad to meet you, Jill, Mr. Pope.
The kids are grown! They don't need you anymore. You told me that. They hardly talk to you.
Then he can move! People move!
For who?
Wait a minute -
Hello! Hello! --
Don't do that.
Look here, sir -- I'm completely at your mercy -- I'm desperate -- it's a matter of life or death -- I had to get some money -- tonight.
Indeed you must, Baron -- you must. Humm -- humm, but you must go to jail, Baron, you're a thief.
Be quiet.
I'm going to call the police. I'm going to watch you play the great Baron with the police. Aristocrat! Aristocrat!
I don't know.
Tell him we'll be hittin' his area some time tomorrow.
Outside?
Oh, I was just writing you a note. What do you say we take a walk?
I don't know if we have any younger man more respected in our operation than you.
Yeah --
Anyway. I want you to think of this as...
Wipe me out?
No, not at all!
Thank you, Jane.
How are you, Mrs De Moraes?
Why don t you ask when I left the Mondrian?
What 'okay' is, it's 'okay' it's over. We've got bigger fish to fry, don't we, Joe?
Just a manner of speaking.
It's the Queen's decision.
Didn't you hear me, Book? Pull! You never had your hands on a teat before?
Did she ask about me?
Who?
The best.
Yes. That's right.
See? Right there. Just what you just said. That's beautiful. A thumbprint on a skyscraper. I couldn't write that.
Hello, Hank. How are you?
No...no.
Ran into a little hassle at the eatum- up-stop.
Give my regards to your managing editor.
Thank you very much.
That's what I wanted to say, but I couldn't think of it.
Sheriff Deeds was in on our archeological find yesterday.
Roger. Keep the shiny side up and the greasy side down. Right, Fred?
No, I don't know.
You know when you know. It makes you shivver, it eats at your insides. You know?
Hey! There are crazy people here.
... Hard?
Yes.
But I sure don't like that she's leaving.
She pay you much?
People have different emotional levels that --
That's fine, Stella. Now would you make me a sandwich?
The kid is amazing.
Come on, come on! We gotta keep moving!
Swell -- only this man doesn't have a garden.
Voil what?
No bother.
Skipper, sorry to bother you.
My wife's house.
I called your house.
We can send you back to your squadron with nothing noted on your record except "CNC" --course not completed, no explanation required. Theoretically, it doesn't hurt your career, but people always wonder about things like that.
She said you took your kid to the each. Every second Sunday. Zoo or beach or the ballgame. Y'have the option... What about me?
Or you can quit.
Or....
I didn't know either. That's why I told Jester to prepare your papers.
I don't know...
Sorry. If I did, I didn't mean to.
So do day jobs.
Must be dangerous. Hooking.
Well, technically, the procedure itself is brain damage, but on a par with a night of heavy drinking. Nothing you'll miss.
We'll start with your most recent memories and go backwards -- There is an emotional core to each of our memories -- As we eradicate this core, it starts its degradation process -- By the time you wake up in the morning, all memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared. Like a dream upon waking.
Is there any sort of risk of brain damage?
They're just eggs, Elden, how embarrassing can eggs be?
I ll be alone.
The lady s not a friend. She s a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
Well, thank you. Anyway -- time for bed. Or... sofa-bed.
Sigurd's sword...
The Avatar. I like the sound of it.
I slew the Lindfarne Worm with it.
Oh, but I have.
You want something to drink?
When's the last time we played a wedding, Jack?
You know why the Grateful Dead are always on tour?
Virgins.
Go ahead.
He's always right. Go ahead. Pick a virgin.
Jack?
I don't want to interfere, or anything ... but she's split up from her boy- friend, that's right isn't it?
Say, listen--
I don't see what's so bad about taking a little drink.
You don't?
No. I definitely don't. I did the sa--
He's a minor, Mr. Stark, and it looks to me like he had more than a little drink.
Head-shrinker?
...you know it, it just takes the pleasure out of everything. I mean, you're gonna die, I'm gonna die, the audience is gonna die, the network's gonna-- The sponsor. Everything!
And we'll celebrate the second anniversary of the day we didn't get married!
Okay, shitbag. I m only going to ask you this once. Where is Friedman?
And how would you define your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth. You know -- you are her...?
Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
You're the boss. Just don't make me repeat myself. I hate that.
I don't know what you're talking about.
I bit the bastard's nose off.
It's a man without a nose you want, you dumb complicit sons of bitches! You've got to listen to me.
Yes! Don't let's get into this thing where I have to repeat myself!
Don't worry, Doc, it's not your problem. You don't have to mix up in this.
Love to--
She's dancing with me.
Here's your shovel.
Go on, tell the truth; I trust you and I put a lot of stock in your opinion.
Oh sure, you're biased -- you're a fellow Muncian. But would an imbecile come up with this?
Aww, naw, Amy, that won't be necessary. I shouldn't send it; she's just doing her job, I guess.
No. Really...don't worry about it.
Hey, Buddy, don't do that anymore.
Chino's gonna wanna talk to me.
I can't hardly believe it. It's Working out just like you said, Wyatt. We're lootin' this burg Six ways through Sunday.
He's gotta know by now that I gave him up back at Glades. He does, he's gonna try to find me. Maybe go see Adele, see what she knows.
Pretty fun too, isn't it?
Kinda, actually, yeah. I gotta admit.
Jack?
Do you know where she's staying in Hawaii?
How long?
You up for it?
No use.
You never disappointed me.
Then you screwed up
I'm alright.
Harder.
Fallacy.
My lord, I'm not sure that...
So the defendant went out fishing for the night with no spare battery, hmmn?
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Wyatt. God, I'm so sorry.
Whoa...whoa...wait a second, Jack. You re not actually gonna cheat on Kate?
Your government needs your help.
What?
On occasion for security purposes, to double for the President at the Secret Service hires someone public functions and exposed situations.
Really?
Oh my God... I thought it was a legitimate deduction, I swear to God. See... I need a piano for my work sometimes...
Mr. Kovic. We're not here about your taxes.
You're not?
No.
It's fabric from the uniform of an Army officer of Guilder.
We'd like to hire you.
Really?
Whatever you say.
Fatal fascination of James Brett wins out.
I ought to be after twenty years.
Sooner it you like.
Get used to disappointment.
You don't. Think so.
Maintaining course. Straight for Mustang.
It's a MiG 21. They don't have radar missiles!
Let's hope you're right!
I've got a six strobe. I think he's locked on us.
Can't shake him.
WHAT'S MIG ONE DOING?
What is he doing?
He's pissing me off!
I must know.
I am?
You are one lucky sonofabitch, you know that?
I guess.
Yeah feels like it.
Didn't they tell you? That hitcher was just about to cut your throat when you stopped to take a leak. You got a fucking horseshoe up your ass, man.
I hope so, too.
When?
This is a cinch. I look up, I look down. I look up --
You like her.
No way, man, no fuckin' way am I gonna turn myself in.
Yeah.
Hey... I'm charged here. But she might kill me for showing up this late.
Will this do?
Well, why didn't you list that among our assets in the first place? What I wouldn't give for a holocaust cloak.
Over the Albino, I think.
At Miracle Max's. It fit so nice, he said I could keep it.
I'll try.
Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.

I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you.
Where's Fezzik?
That's all right. I'll attend to this.
Yes and so do I, but there are too few of us here to carry it. TOO - HEAVY
I haven't been the father to you that --
Wait a minute--let's match for it.
Duane's guys, but he's got them under control.
Man, you were a mess!
I'll pick you up.
That the bottle Lou gave you? Better go easy on that stuff.
And...
Her?... Oh -- the First Lady... She was giving that commencement speech up in Bryn Mawr. I managed to catch her before she left the hotel.
You're going to get out of this... you're going to go on and you're going to make babies and watch them grow and you're going to die an old lady, warm in your bed. Not here. Not this night. Do you understand me?
It was an accident.
I just hope this yutz can pull it off.
Everybody else is buying the minor stroke' story...
The thought I'm tryin' to get over is you grew up beauteeful. Remember me?
What's the matter with you?
Well then ... shall we?
How dare you say you love me.
I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
Someone needs to grow up. I won't take it, Jack.
It's okay. Last one.
You know I read a lot. Especially things that have to do with history. I find that shit fascinating. In fact, I don't know if you know this or not, Sicilians were spawned by niggers.
Some people got faces that stick in your mind.
I haven't the time. I'm much too busy seeing that you don't lose any of the money I married you for.
Just souvenirs. Towels and stuff.
I never wanted to hurt anybody. In fact... I even thought I was helping.
Where are you going?
Where's home?
No -- but I got something.
Sorry. I just --
Boo.
Thanks.
Now you got me! It's a wonder I wasn't punchy by the time I was twelve. The rulers those Sisters used to whack me with! They thought they could beat an education into me I foxed 'em.
I know. Anyway --
I have already heard about this cafe, and also about Mr. Rick himself.
Oh, there is no hurry. Tonight he'll be at Rick's. Everybody comes to Rick's.
What else, my dear Major?
Oh, we Germans must get used to all climates, from Russia to the Sahara. But perhaps you were not referring to the weather.
Realizing the importance of the case, my men are rounding up twice the usual number of suspects.
By the way, the murder of the couriers, what has been done?
Well, I was thinking, we've Already made a pile of money. Maybe we should just pull up Stakes and move on. And we could Stay on the move, you know? Just Keep going, see the world. Live On room service the rest of our Lives. How'd that be?
Believe it or not, I actually tricked a girl into falling in love with me. I'm not quite sure how I did it. I'd hate to have to do it again. But I did it. Wanna say hi to my better half?
What?
...I had a great time tonight, really. It was like the Nuremberg Trials.
Right. Yeah. I had a...
Yeah. Me, too.
Can't I just maim it a little?
Well, I have to admit my game's a little rusty, but I love polo. It's unrelenting, a constant challenge to the senses. Really a beautiful experience.
God's back on our side, so let's get smokin'.
I'd love that.
I have to get in there. I have to stop this flight.
Let me by, Elaine.
I don't know. Maybe it's because of your sweet voice.
I left my wallet. My credit cards, cash, fucking ID, everything. We gotta go back.
What?
You don't understand. The wedding bands. The wedding bands are in my wallet.
Big deal. We'll call right now and cancel your cards.
No. She ordered them special. Took her forever to find them. They've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in Sanskrit. We've got to go back. Christine'll fucking crucify me.
Okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. Some bar. Christine'll understand.
Please, Miles, please.
No way. No way.
Forget it. Your wallet was stolen at a bar. Happens every day.
Yes. How do you know?
That wasn't me. I was being possessed by my brother, Adrian. He's the one who call you a gross pig.
What?
I really have to go.
Compassion.
Nothing is easy.
Your call. Have a good night.
It's his show for now. Look, you want to get some dinner? Inter- Agency cooperation and all?
Wasn't my idea.
Oh, yeah, really? Really? How-how'd you like it? Was it-was it, I mean, did it... was it heavy? Did it achieve total heavy-ocity? Or was it, uh...
Oh, humdinger. When- Well, I got a wonderful idea. Why don'tcha get the guy who took you to the rock concert, we'll call him and he can come over and kill the spider. You know, it's a-
I told you a thousand times you should always keep, uh, a lotta insect spray. You never know who's gonna crawl over.
Jesus. All right, gimme a magazine. I- 'cause I'm a little tired. You know, you, you joke with-about me, you make fun of me, but I'm prepared for anything. An emergency, a tidal wave, an earthquake. Hey, what is this? What? Did you go to a rock concert?
What is this? What are you, since when do you read the "National Review"? What are you turning in to?
How long's it been shut?
They're always writing to me saying they want to come to Rome!
No, Mamma, it only takes an hour by air, you know.
Do they, m'dear?
Yeah? And what about my enemies?
Alright!
I loved you since the day I met you, and I haven't stopped.
Listen, I don't expect all the troubles between us can just vanish away. But I would do what I can...
Edie it's
What I did to Joey.
What I did to Joey.
He still living?
It did.
It was an emergency. I only lied that night because it was the only way I knew to stop her. I knew if I didn't, I'd never see her again.
Hey -- if a good man can make a better life, let him make it.
I feel bad about walkin'.
Take your shot, kid -- You got money for trainin' expenses?
A few bucks.
Here's five hundred -- Put it in your glove.
Do I have to pay juice?
I'm doing great. You ready?
How're you doing--?
How's that, Quince?
Okay. All aboard - New York, New York!
Not my birthday again?
Whatever. And I thought, please God, give me a sign, give me some way to keep this woman from getting into that taxi and disappearing from my life forever. And He did. She told me the name. Granted, it wasn't my name, but it was a start.
Assets are anything of value a company owns. Sometimes the pieces are worth more than the whole. By selling them off, I make a profit.
Y'know I won't be able to work for ya no more.
You recognized me.
Does Santa Claus charge juice? Merry Christmas -- Now, how's about my present, ya gonna win?
I'm not sure... I might have.
I -- I'm not sure if I'm supposed to tell you or not.
Why didn't you tell me?
Having a nervous breakdown.
What are you doing in here?
Jamie --
Please stop -- please!
In a bar called Hellfire.
Tch...how romantic. Yeah. If I wasn't already committed to Lydia, boy. Except Anne'd never go for me though. She loves you too much. And you really love her, huh?
No. But that's not the only reason people get together or..stay together.
What are the other reasons?
When are you gonna see it, John? She doesn't give a damn about you.
You know nothing about her!
She'll get over it.
She'll be worried about me.
And when was the last time she put herself out for you? Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant.
I can't let her down now, Archie.
Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants.
Oh, I'm much more than that.
Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know.
You watch your tongue.
I am, this is it. B Day.
I already know it, Mary.
Here. Spend it on your trip to Katmandu.
Same here again.
Pat Healy.
Why not?
So, there are rules. Things you do and things you don't do.
So?
Yeah... I've made it with a girl...
Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of em take a couple seconds... ...some of em take a lot longer...
I am going to call the police now.
Could I make one phone call first?
I want you out of here.
Look -- I'll give you ten dollars for a dime -- I'll give you twenty -- for God's sake, will you let me use that phone?
Mr. McCleery -- do you have some change? I need to use the phone?
Sure, the story is cold, but I'm not. I'm sizzling - look! Psst!
Are you staying?
Have you ever made it with a girl?
Figure it out? Figure what out?!
Thank you. I owe you a dollar forty--here--keep the change.
Thank you, sir.
Three Jacks.
I'll take one.
Ever wondered why Jenny Greenteeth said you needed the fastest steed on earth?
Sapphire!
Never show mercy!
I could have struck off his head just now!
It's done... we'll never catch him.
Well, let's do it.
...We're saved!
We're all dying from the start. I just got picked for Advanced Placement.
I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I still don't know what that means.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good.
And you told Mom today?
Yes.
No...
Uh, your earring?
It is possible the French authorities will find a reason to put him in the concentration camp here.
I I'd like to, Edie, but there's nothin' I can do. Edie feels subdued, ashamed at breaking down. She rises, and in a low voice says
There are only two other alternatives for him.
Many of my people will not believe those things are possible. On my planet there is only one government, one people, one language. I will be asked a lot of questions.
I understand.
If you want to keep it, you can.
I will say that we can be friends.
Yes, Giron! Chairman of the board of Colet and Company. Honorary president of the Orphans' Asylum. Adolph J. Giron--distinguished citizen! ... Well, shall I call the police? I see! You have to be in the social register to keep out of jail. But when a man starts at the bottom and works his way up--a self-made crook --then you say, "Call the police! Put him behind bars! Lock him up!"
Then why are you afraid to let me prove it?
It would be a terrible scandal, wouldn't it?
Sure.
Oh, you mean Fred.
Could I have a cigarette?
Lotta law around here. Just met the Sheriff.
Wyatt, meet Fred White, he's town marshal.
Gave all that up. Going into business.
A writer's life is his work. Jack Kerouac doesn't have to kill a bull to have something to write about. He's out there feeling, burning... grooving on life!
You talked to Stifler?
...okay. Cool then. I'm um, I'm glad you came by. I mean, really.
I know, Vick. I'm just not ready yet, okay?
How did you know I was here?
Uh...my dad's the manager.
Any universe that exists or ever existed. You may be the pro, Joe. But I know who you are. And you're all fucked up.
And I don't give a shit.
May I remind you this is not just a dispute with a putative suitor, this is me. So watch it...Bill.
Cut the 'Bill' crap out -- you sonofabitch.
I told you, 'watch it'.
What're you doing here anyway?
What piece? Richard Crookback?
Well, I am a dead man and buggered to boot. My theatre is close by the plague these twelve weeks, my company is playing the inn-yards of England, while Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court and receive ten pounds to play your piece, written for my theatre, by my writer, at my risk when you were green and grateful -
Henslowe, you have no soul so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soulmate?
Aphrodite Baggot who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?
Who wrote that?
Alright?
Sure.
I didn't ask anyone for a shrink, that was someone else. Also: This pudding is not mine. Also: I'm wearing a suit because I had a very important business meeting this morning and I don't have a crying problem.
This is funny.
Go ahead; you've a key. Slip it through my tiny hole...
You go to hell.
I thought it fitting, considering the rocky terrain --
Right now. Guess who's been buying Coke from him for the last five and half years?
Dr. Wong -- what type of medicine do you practice?
--And is Miss Lawson a patient of yours?
Why does she come to you?
Yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.
Begin!
Hell, if they don't blow up his place, they'll get him some other way. Don't make no difference no-how.
Make you a deal. My brother took Over the Marshal's office in Tombstone. Got it in his head He's gonna make the place safe For widows and orphans. You and Your boys stay out of his way, I'll make sure he stays out of yours.
He kept it in the side table in the front hallway. He showed me. I visited a few times. Then one of Jonas's guys visited. When I arrived, your dad was dying.
To Jonas. I didn't know that at the time. Didn't know who he was. But I knew inside, whoever he was, he'd send someone else. So I started watching your father. I wanted to keep him safe.
I don't know what it was. All I know is I had a gun in my hand, but when I saw you standing with him, I couldn't do it. If that's love, it's not so bad. I found a part of myself that day. I couldn't go back.
Can't give you the details because I can't remember. I went to court to kill him. At the Ezekiel Walters hearing. I was supposed to shoot him at the press conference. You were there. That's the first time I saw you.
Walters was their fall guy. Blow up a building and blame a nut. Create fear. Don't you see? Your father wasn't trying to keep Walters in prison. He was looking into getting him out. He didn't believe the official story.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to kill you.
Still a coincidence. Timing and all.
He hit his head. On the way in.
Still and all. Carl was a strong swimmer, he m...
Did ya get the message, kid?
'Bout what?
Here's the card?
Ya puttin' me on?
Is it better?
Well. Sex, I guess. Is sex with him better?
Of course it is.
What's the matter?
Nothing... Let's get crazy!
Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
Thank you, sir.
The thing to do is stick to rabbits.
What was he in jail for?
You sure worry that bone. He killed a fellow.
In a fight?
Nice.
Thank you.. I accept your apology with the hope that what went on yesterday will never happen again.
But it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. You shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?
The other fellow wasn't even lookin'.
This is an awful nice gun. Certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.
Yeah. That's right, Jocko. Those white guys sure shoot up at you like a yeast cake if you just cock an eye at them.
...Yeah, give 'er the Blades.
Ain't skated since I was fifteen -- That's when I started fightin' -- gotta watch the ankles. Yeah, fightin' use to be tops with me, but no more. All I wanted to prove was I weren't no bum -- That I had the stuff to make a good pro.
...Ten minutes.
Yep. Then I fucked your daughter.
Hey, I ain't cryin'... I still fight. Kinda do it like a hobby. See I'm a natural southpaw an' most pugs won't fight a southpaw 'cause we mess up their timin' an' look awkward -- Southpaw means lefthanded... But I guess in the long run things probably worked out for the best, right?
OH, THANK YOU! THANK YOU! TH-- Something went very, very wrong here.
All right. You can come.
You gotta talk me into it. You'll screw up on your own. I mean, a guy's gotta have a sidekick. For moral support! Wisecracks - snappy banter - It's the land of Death, Stu, the Land of Death! Don't go in there without your comedy relief!!
Right after we played backgammon.
Approximately? One thousand bucks.
Hey, how much are we ahead?
Preach! Go down and get me some White Tavern whisky, a glass, and some ice.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of pool for a thousand dollars a game.
Preach... get it at Johnny's. You got a bet.
Preacher! Go on down and get me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown. No ice, no glass.
I've got one chance to get back to Julie, and I'm gonna take it - with or without you.
Are you telling me I'm a - "non-smoker"?
Just for now.
Okay -- Likes: Thai food, feminist prose, and "angry, stinky girl music of the indie-rock persuasion".
So what does that give me? I'm supposed to buy her some noodles and a book and sit around listening to chicks who can't play their instruments?
He's pretty!
Okay! I wasn't sure
Ever been to Club Skunk?
Yeah.
You haven't said a word since we left the club -- what happened back there?
Well, that don't do me one bit of good!
What's it mean, "No Hair"?
He's ninety. He's practically dead already. How come he goes back and I stay here?
Maybe he wanted to pick out his own casket?
HEY!! HEY, YOU!!
He got an E-ticket. Where's mine? When do I get to wake up??
Then I'll take you home. You'll feel better tomorrow.
I've been stuck down here for months. Somebody had better start paying attention, or I'm gonna - I'm gonna kick ass!
Let's not kick the nice Reaper's ass.
Will you stand still so I can do this!
I'm sorry....I'm just so excited. You must have felt this way when you first met Anne, huh? Where did you two meet?
And you believe that.
Yes! That's it!
Mein Dealer.
Bob...
He sells BMW's?
How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully?
Let me out!
Arachtoids. From Planet Ten.
Careful...don't make noise and don't touch me. I'm hotter than flapjacks.
I'm a giant semi-conductor, and there's alien creatures all around us. Form the Eighth Dimension, I think. Look...
Ever since that phony phone call from the President. Look at this. What is it?
It's an antidote. A formula. Whoever it was on the phone made me scribble this and gave me the ability to penetrate their disguises.
I have to try, dammit! Something, anything . . .
Oh my God.
Yeah, that's the story of my life.
I'm Sheriff Deeds--
I've seen 'em.
Jesus Christ!
Will you calm down?
She's away to Windsor tomorrow. Talk to her there.
You training to be a nun or something?
Hey, Jack. Jack.
Nice-looking kid.
No--
Fernando did okay, and he dropped out--
It might just be the age. I spent my first fifteen years trying to be just like Buddy and the next fifteen trying to give him a heart attack.
Is she obedient?
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg. I have an ancient name that will bring you preferment when your grandson is a Wessex. Is she fertile?
Beautiful, wasn't it?
Yes.
A super market. Huh.
Maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.
Don't you believe it, Rose. Don't!
This is horseshit.
"With that, Fanchon expelled a scream so extravagantly pitched, that the surgeon was obliged to tear out her tongue --"
...yes I'm still on hold...
You know exactly where they are!
What?
George, we've just confirmed the existence of the live extraterrestrial.
Well, we're in pursuit of a green Mustang...
When can we expect containment?
Yes. It's kidnapped a woman at gunpoint and from what we can make out is forcing her to drive it somewhere.
It's in a green Mustang?
-- I like the car I have.
-- This your idea of small talk?
-- Obviously.
Grand Central. You better not be fucking with me cause it's your ass on the line.
He ever accept cash for a favor?
Well, that's where the pyramids are and we want real pyramids in the ad.
What do you mean by that?
You mean you're not coming back to work here?
You've had a better offer, eh?
Well, go on and take it. Work for somebody else! That's the gratitude I get for --
What were you when you came here five years ago? A little college girl from a School of Journalism! I took a little doll-faced mugg --
Get out? We had an arrangement.
Oh, I'm worse. Much, much worse.
Right now, it doesn't seem so.
No.
Did you do it?
Yeah.
This I can do. I was studying at the University of Paris -- till the English invaded it.
Why?
Well... uh -- this might take a little time -- but let me see what I can do.
Don't worry about it. We're just having coffee. We'll be anti- social.
No.
Yeah, just keep going first, keep going around. Get the feel of it, feel the clutch, when you put it in a little?
Yeah. With potential.
What makes him so special?
I'm in town until Saturday.
Some time.
Mom? Eve and I have to go.
I can't explain it now. But I want you to set the locks for two months. You have more than enough of everything. Then we'll be back to get you.
And, I'm asking you to trust me without understanding why.
But, I don't understand.
Well, in that case...of course, son.
Hildy, you think I could? After this story? Here! You're just nervous.
I mean, they don't know for sure he's dead. Look, there's always a chance we'll walk out've there with nothing. I say let fate decide.
Who says anybody's gonna be with us? I say we go to the fights tomorrow, find out what the Snoop's big plan is, then go in ahead of those guys -- alone.
Let Glenn deal with the Snoop, while we're off livin' the good life.
Hey! Virgil! My God! Morgan! Hey, Boy! You look great! Both of you!
Yeah, it's called Glades Correctional Institution and I'm sure as shit not going back there or any place like it.
Now you're here. Who are your "friends"?
Don't give me that coffee, you rummy. Now blow!
I'll bring him up to your loft.
He followed my birds into their coop. Here, you want him?
Go on, beat it!
I thought you guys were busted.
Will you please excuse me? I'll be right back.
You hear that?
You know, I'm not sure. I don't think they'd tried for kids before, as fate would have it.
It's the hair! It's to do with the hair.
How did it end?
It was an accident -- about eighteen months ago.
Who is?!
Well, it's a small town. Sooner or later things catch up with you... don't they?
I was a lot earlier.
I just wanted to tell you how great you were. My name's Tom Grunick.
Well, they say if you can reach even one person, it means something... And you did that.
I'm going to the war. The real war. Hitler's taken Europe. The Brits are hanging on by their fingernails, and If they lose, there'll be more people killed than anybody can imagine. And not just there, but here.
Colonel Doolittle pulled the strings, and put me on loan to the R.A.F. They need pilots, and we need experience. I leave tomorrow.
The only reason it's hard to say is that I keep thinking I don't have the right to say it. But I've got to because it's true. I love you. That must surprise you.
There's one thing I have to say. I'm going away.
I had to tell you in person. Because there's something else I need to say.
Oh! Hello, Amy -- was it -- I thought she said, Mamie --
You goin' right back to work?
I'm a colonel.
Does this room look silly?
If you did it wrong, it would be painful. You'd choke to death.
I could hang myself.
How shall I do it?
Because this must be stopped.
Why are you doing this to me?
Surprised?
Hey, hey, hey!
Sully...! What the fuck happened here?!
What do you mean 'why'?
Answer the question, shitball.
This night, this reunion will be an important step in our relationship.
Classic. Absolutely classic. Profit from major sales push -- minus ?347.
Having a little trouble with that knot, aren't you?
No, I don't.
Wyoming? Not Cody, by any chance?
I'd turn around, but I'm afraid you'd strangle me.
She was the Queen of the Netherlands.
I don't recall authorizing you to have a personal life.
A thief this good could handle the sensors in the rooms. What we don't get is how he effectuated his entry.
So he popped the pane?
Yes.
He's still a boy--out in the world, he's still a boy.
It's your heart--you ought to take it with you.
I don't know! He's just leaving-- you're the one who says he needs to see the world! That's what he'll do--he'll see the world!
Good luck.
You mean, this ring?
It's dangerous!!
What are you doing? You can't go in there!
Usually they start you on the wines with learning disabilities, but this one's pretty damn good. This is the new one, right, Chris?
No we can't. That's the problem. God knows it would beat hanging around with you!
Now.
How would you rate this one?
That's what you do with every one.
When do we get to drink it?
Now set your glass down and get some air into it.
It's okay. I hardly used to see them anyway. I didn't have much parental guiding. The public defender kept sayin' that at my parole hearin'. He was a good ol' boy, stood by me... Even brought me some cartons of cigarettes from time to time.
Alright. Let me write a letter.
Hell, peanut, you stuck with me after I planted Bob Ray Lemon. A man can't ask for more than that.
I guess I started smokin' when I was about six... My mama was already dead from lung cancer...
Camels, same as me... Guess both my mama and my daddy died of smoke or alcohol related illness.
Here's another twenty. Will that do? I mean, what's it going to take!
But I gave it to you!
What are you doing? Give that back!
You want to see some?
You won't.
Hey, you are in a bad mood. You-you- you must be getting your period.
Shush. Of course you can.
I-i-i-i-it's all right, fellas. Jesus, what'd you do, come by way of the Panama Canal?
Bad mood? I'm standing with the cast of "The Godfather."
Deal! I'm dealing with two guys named Cheech!
It's a bar. People come together, drink, fall in love, fall out of love, air their grudges out--
Thank you, Your Honor.
Where'd he get all this?
Do you think you are ready?
Ever since his unfortunate death, there's been a surge of interest in his work. I'll use the profits to restore Charenton to her former glory.
What do you think I should get?
...Noooo.
What are my choices?
You lied to me!
No.
I was in love once, Willow. She had a hold on my heart. I could barely function. I was a great swordsman! I was knighted! I could have been king!
You?
Madmartigan, I need your help.
My help? A great magician like you? You don't need any help.
Sure...
Maybe, when we get the Grail...
I better go.
Okay...
Where did you get this gun?
Uh... have you been feeling okay?
Parry, you don't have to earn a woman. It's the twentieth century.
I'm never bored! It's all very... different for me... here.
It's me!
Who's that!
They're looking for you!--
How'd you find me? What's happening?
They think you told the police on them. They--who's in there?
We know.
Well, see, I think she can help...You know women are great..they...they make homes and they..ya know, kill the livestock so the knights can go out and get Grails and...and slaughter villages with a clear head...I mean, where would Arthur be without Guinevere...
Kit
More pictures? My God, Marylin. You can open an erotic art gallery.
No. Just to comfort you, and appreciate you --
To victory.
What.
I've seen you before. Your picture...
That's fine.
What could cause a tincture like this?
You'll get more from her with kindness than you will with force.
Yes.
I gotta talk to you. I want you to tell me something and I want you to give it to me straight. Get me?
Monsieur F lix -- ?
I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps.
Yeah. You mind?
So you're gonna leave it on. Every night. For a week.
Zit cream?
Yeah.
Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
I don't know. I mean, I always did it as a kid. I figured it was no big deal. Is it? A big deal?
It's my entire baseball collection. It's yours now.
These are wonderful.
Hi, honey!
You know, you have a wonderful sense of humor, son! I must say, the acorn doesn't fall very far from the tree. By the way, it's time I gave you something. Come with me.
Haben sie etuas nettes in leder?!
Sorgen sie bitte dafur das die gepack sorgfaltic behandeldt warren!
Gerade aus dann links!
It's a game, son. I can explain it pretty easily. There's a pitcher.
What's baseball?
Because she didn't know she was going on a trip -- and where she was going she wouldn't need a handbag.
Do they hide it in their husband's clothes?
Inside stuff?
I'm with you, sweetie, but Detective Thomas J. Doyle has a pat answer for that.
That's what the witnesses told him.
I told 'em I'd play along with them if they lowered their prices - and cut down expenses - and broadcast.
Oh, that - well, we had another meeting. I told them I'd go on being Chairman if
Sure. I met you.
Uh, not today, but --
Did you tell him about the "ten million for four years?"
I understand your anxiety.
John Taylor. J.J. Stokes. Andre Rison. I SMOKE all these fools, and yet they're making the big sweet dollars. They're making the money, and I got an agent that ain't even put the number on the table.
Get a ride with somebody.
You know Mark Ratner really likes you. You like him?
What a guy.
Do you have any ice tea?
What happened?
Like I told ya. My thumbs.
No, I don't mean the thumbs. You already told me about the thumbs.
You name the place, boss. I'll be there.
What happened to you anyway?
Where do I sign?
The first match I got in mind for you is in Louisville, Kentucky.
Maybe you oughta give me lessons.
Sign up.
I been thinking.
Thinking about what?
Just the same.
Maybe next time.
Oh. No. Strictly dryland.
Trunks?
What?
Nice, huh?
Oh, yes. On the pier.
Yours, too. Are you the McKinney, the dentist on Calumet Avenue in Chicago?
Mr. Clyde, I remember everything.
Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club?"
Yes it does.
Dance with me.
Okay.
Why did you hold his collar?
Absolutely right, shut up. Lashings of apologies all round.
What? What? That boy, that little boy, you were holding his collar, gripping his collar, what for?
Is he next? Do you drag him into your little room? Where is it? Is this it?
I've watched you - on verandahs, at Garden Parties, at the Races - how can you stand there? How can you ever smile? As if your life hadn't capsized?
And what would you say...
Promise me you won't leave without saying goodbye.
No, sir.
No--I'll take Sally and give you the best of it.
I sincerely hope not.
A couple of months ago I looked up your card in the group insurance file.
Eight-thirty!
Let me take that.
English muffin. How do you do it?
This is not how you do it. You want this on an English muffin or a bun?
Dad, you're not taking this seriously.
She looks like my third grade teacher. I hated my third grade teacher. Hold it! Wait a minute! She is my third grade teacher!
It doesn't. They ask you.
But not dinner necessarily on the first date because by the time you're halfway through dinner you might be sorry you asked them to dinner whereas if it's just a drink, if you like them you can always ask them for dinner but if you don't you can go home if you see what I mean. I wonder if it still works this way.
-- a slice of pizza --
You see someone you like, you get a feeling about them, you ask them if they want to have a drink or --
If you get a new wife, I guess you'll have sex with her, huh?
I'm starting to notice that.
Headquarters!? What is it?
I wish I could say the same for George Zipp.
Is it? Because of my mistake six men didn't return from that raid.
You're still beautiful...
You're injured.
Good morning, sir.
We're all excited around here. My brother just got the Congressional Medal of Honor. The President just decorated him.
Good year? Well, between you and me, Mr. Carter, we're broke.
Well . . . . . . now, come right in here, Mr. Carter.
Lois, I . . .
Well. Good luck with that --
I think you'll know when you see him at the gate.
Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting.
You were trying to break down the door. Do you know why?
Just a little strategy session. But in person this time.
Kelvin, you awake?
Why?
Can you meet me and Sartorius on B deck in an hour?
Why not? He's a thief--he's a criminal.
Huh? Oh, I'm not worrying about her - I'm worrying about that second act curtain, that's all.
This is the top.
At first, I thought it was a gag, but she's always done it!
No matter how many times I leave the toilet seat up, she forgets and puts it down.
My very point. Here's another one...
She admires. Tommy Lasorda.
Why would you let her to do that?
No--to Mexico. I've got to talk to somebody.
Those Rockefellers!
What brings you here?
I don't believe you. I think you came up to see me.
I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and...
You like me, huh?
What did it say?
Can't see a thing.
You just say. I'm not really --
What do you want to hear?
No, I'm okay for now.
Look, I want to forget you, I do. I think if you hold me, just this once, I can walk away and never speak to you again.
I don't think your friend likes me.
Un Autrichien. Negociant en pr - pubescents.
Right. And you-and you know what the beauty part is?
What s an hour of your time worth these days, Nathalie? Combien, Nathalie!
Yeah, and I-I tru- you know, I trust her, because my-my analyst recommended her.
You know, I-I-I don't think many couples could handle this. You know, they could just break up and remain friends.
We can always come back together again. Because there's no-there's no problem. 'Cause... Right.
The plane to Lisbon. You would like to be on it?
Hello, Louis.
How extravagant you are, throwing away women like that. Someday they may be scarce.
You know, I think now I shall pay a call on Yvonne, maybe get her on the rebound, eh?
When it comes to women, you're a true democrat.
Yeah.
You're with us in battle.
We be honored, friend Ogg.
Not without Leeloo.
Oh . . . me? Oh, well, I feel funny enough already, with all these kids.
You're staying at the hotel?
I don't like your tone, and I don't like your references.
An offense --
You're talking through your hat. You're offering a deal because you've got no proof.
Look, I'm sorry --
No problem. If I can ask one question.
Puking on yourself in midair is not a good death.
Just like sex with my wife.
Also like sex with my wife.
Tell you what, we'll jump together.
Half what you owed me. I am still due for One Gentleman of Verona.
Nobody! You are writing it for me! I gave you three pounds a month since.
It's not about working hard --
I SAID OKAY?
Oh, yeah. No. I mean yeah, I stopped by for a drink. Didn't see you.
Sure.
They didn't hire Peter Stiller from the Times and he had a great audition tape.
Well, since I'm not only your father, I'm also your friend; I had to get you two presents.
They really applauded you today honey.
Now this is the only thing your mother ever gave me that I kept. Now it's yours. Go ahead, open it.
No, wait a minute. Everybody thinks you're what?
I'm hungry for a proper visit.
What?
No no no. I just underestimated her... her temper, I guess. Why are we even talking about this?
Peter. Your life must matter to you because it matters to all of us who love you.
But it's true. I have no faith. It's strange. When that gun was pointed at my face tonight, I was surprised, but never frightened. It was as if I knew nothing could possibly happen to me and...in that one moment I didn't care about anything. Not eve my own life.
You know, I respect that you have such faith, James. I don't understand it, but I want you to know that despite our differences, I admire you and I always will.
Yeah.
No. Just me. Me an' her.
If there was any way out...
Our families, Fred. I've always looked on Bessie as my own sister.
Now, Pete! Please don't appeal to my Sentimental side.
Fred!
I wish you wouldn't talk like that, Pete.
Fred, I don't know what to say. A thing like this almost destroys a man's faith in human nature.
Pete, you're through!
If you're talking about my brother- in-law, he's worked for the city fifteen years.
I mean I'm scratching your name off the ticket Tuesday and running Czernecki in your place. It's nothing personal. And, Pete -- it's the only way out. It's a sacrifice we all ought to be glad to make.
What do you mean -- through?
What do you mean?
I'm, it really doesn't matter. Think C.I.A. and exponentiate. I'm a government employee and I've been watching Jerry for awhile.
Don't be so bloody na ve. You know there's a war breaking out. This arrived this morning. By order of the British Government - all International Expeditions to be aborted by May 1939.
Why do they care about our maps?
Those maps belong to His Majesty's Government. They're confidential. They shouldn't be left lying around for any Tom, Dick or Mary to have sight of.
What's the matter with you?
And where are the Expedition Maps?
Which we couldn't explore because of rocks, because of cross-winds, it's sloppy. And here - and here - we could be staring at Zerzura.
No, because you can't see from the air! If you could explore from the air life would be very simple! Look! What is that? Is that a wadi? That whole spur is a real possibility
Which we've overflown twice.
Okay, okay--I know you do, too.
Fine. That's all there is to it then.
So we should "wait and see." For how long?
Then you pickin' 'em too fast--they ain't no better than drops to me. See that bruise, and that one? Half of these is bruised! Look at this one! It ain't got no stem! You might as well step on 'em, too--they only good for cider.
That is a trifle strong.
To risk one's life against such people is an imposition.
It is distasteful to kill a scoundrel -- that should be work for a hangman.
He doesn't answer.
Why does he have a lock on his door?
Wandering about.
Nay. Tempting as your invitation be. Tell me one thing more.
Not very precise directions.
Where do I find the Baron's castle?
How do I get the horn back?
What became of the princess?
...Did ya fight last night?
Yeah, they're goin', -- that's nature... That was my locker for six years.
More like thirty.
Come July, twenty-five.
The legs must be goin'.
Twenty-five, thirty -- What's the difference? -- It took me two months to learn the combination of that locker.
How old are ya?
Facts is facts. I run a business here -- I'm cleanin' house --
...What?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Well what?
What do I want?
Did you ever prescribe any medication for her cramps?
It's all right. I thought you'd go back to New York like Sam and Ingie, and the rest of them.
All right, for a minute. I still can't understand it though. You know I didn't tell anybody I was coming here.
I don't want to be.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.
Is that another Christmas present?
That's not true. He never came near my tabloids. That's one thing I always protect... my tabloids.
Hello... send him up.
Take it easy. Take a deep breath.
Now listen boss, if you're going to kick about that expense account
Do you call yourself a reporter?
It has been alleged - yes
What?!
I guess we'll call you two-ply.
So Oz, you almost made it, huh?
You were right.
Well that's very nice of you.
It's not safe, they say. The doctors say it isn't possible to go deeper and live. Free diving is over as a sport.
We can't dive anymore. They want to cancel the competition for a while.
No! I would never cheat you.
You say that because you have the title!
Please drink your coffee.
Hello Marylin.
Hard to believe this is the way it will end up for us.
But then -- I guess -- something inside me died when I realized that you'd hired a goon to kill me.
So now we're in the mining Business. Turning into regular Tycoons. Gonna call this one the Mattie Blaylock. Mattie'll get a Kick out of that, it's her maiden Name.
You're the doctor. sad news, friend.
Something like what...
What are they?
Ah.
Certainly.
But unlike the clockworks of the Clock People, my ticks more accurately echo the ticks of the universe.... ......ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
During the Second World War I busted out of Tule Lake detention camp; as a Japanese-American, I had been put there and watched over. I found refuge with the Clock People, who discovered me in a snow bank, near dead, I had been climbing across the Sierra Nevada mountains.
Oh yeah. Fine.
He was a degenerated warlock who could turn urine into beer, and the honor that he extended me gave me rights of occupancy in this sacred cave on this far-away Siwash Ridge. I came to the Dakota hills to construct a clockworks of my own.
The Clock People mistook me for Chinese. And the name stuck. In the same way that all Indian tribes came to be labeled "Indians" through the ignorance of an Italian sailor with a taste for oranges, it is only fitting that "Indians" misnamed me. The Clock People, however, are not a tribe, rather they are a gathering of Indians from various tribes. They have lived together since 1906.
Shut up. Here's to a great week.
Yes. Absolutely. Despite your crass behavior, I'm really glad we're finally getting this time together.
Yeah.
You know how long I've been begging to take you on the wine tour. I was beginning to think it was never going to happen.
Okay, that's very easy. Five, six years from now I'll be in town to collect an award representing the surge in foreign coverage by local stations.
100 Pinot Noir. Single vineyard. They don't even make it anymore.
Pinot Noir? How come it's white? Doesn't noir mean dark?
Jesus. Don't ask questions like that up in the wine country. They'll think you're a moron.
Let's go...
Color in the red wines comes from the skins. This juice is free run, so there's no skin contact in the fermentation, ergo no color.
Maybe the best part of your life is over and you don't want to get up and start the bad part.
Stop. Ernie thought I was good too -- he couldn't help. My agent has a hot prospect -- the number two station in Portland. The general manager says he wants to be every bit as good as the networks. Personally, I think he should aim higher.
Ernie told this story. How he used to write obits and when the people in town called him up with death notices, he cried. He was till that way when they promoted him out of obits. He says you're lucky if you can get out while you could still cry. I should have quit this place three years ago.
So I guess that's it.
That's compared to, like, earthquakes in the Far East or testicular cancer?
It's all right. Danny always said I see things with my emotions instead of my eyes.
Don't worry about that. Guys away from home, lonely, good-hearted women try to cheer them up.
It's not necessary, Joe. Drew's going to step aside --
Sure -- He can hit -- Don't play no more -- Stick an' move, hear?
Now why can't I tell the story?
Oh, I realized right away. He's really a very nice fellow, Hildy -- I found that out.
Did you finish the interview?
But, gee, Hildy -- he gave us that insurance business -- and you promised --
Sort of.
Well, let me start it. I'm flying down to Los Angeles on business, and I decide to take her on her first aeroplane.
So tell me, tell me, I'm peeing in my pants.
I can't see anything--she's too bright!
I have a proposition.
I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
That's enough.
You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
Good day, Marquis.
THEN BUGGER ME!
Remember slamming the cab door in my face and.. you know, it came very dangerously close to emasculating my nose in a...
We're getting ready to hold public hearings on waterfront crime and underworld infiltration of longshore unions.
I don't know nothing.
Well, the line's growing weaker, little brother. Lucky for us there aren't any dragons left to slay.
Inland.
There are all kinds of groups, all kinds of initials. But they're all part of two warring factions. One: families that have held wealth for centuries. They want one thing. Stability. Group Two: the boat rockers. Eisenhower's military industrial complex. They want instability. It's a trillion dollar a year business. When there isn't a hot war, they make a cold one.
Maybe.
Jesus... It's my fault. They drew a black line over me and now I'm passing it on. I'm passing it to you, too.
This is the first book that I got you.
Oh, excuse me. This is -- uh -- this is --
So every time you think about showing that jury strength. Or honor or composure. Or dignity.
Yeah, whatever. I want you to go out with her.
I've been thinking about that since you brought it up before.
No... ... I don't get this place. They make me buy an outfit but they let you wear a house dress. I don't get it.
No. Wait. What? Why? I didn't mean it. You gotta sit down. You can still give me the dirty look... just sit down and give it to me.
That monominute somebody gets that you need them they threaten to go away. Never fails.
There.
What do you think?
Two legs, nice rack...
What?!
Who shot who?
Only the right people can have you, Curly.
That's true.
They wanted a girl.
You're one of the best, Curly--we couldn't let just anyone take you.
Hey, you can t park that thing here.
It s me, Jack...
How d you know my name?
We bowl together. We re bowlers ...we won a championship...we re winners.
I never won anything in bowling.
Wait a second... Jack...Jack...
Yes...Jack Campbell...
Of course. Jack Campbell. I went to high school with you...you played baseball, right? You re doing well...
I'm partial to mountains myself. But if you like islands, we'll make it an island.
I'm waiting on some money coming through. It's just that at the moment, you know, I'm short. They're going to chuck me out. On the street in Bangkok, that's bad.
Where did you two meet?
Tell it to me in there and my lips are sealed. But if I dig it out myself I can use it where it'll do the most good.
Never?
I don't expect you to.
You won't like it.
Nah, really, it was moronic.
I don't like what you're saying.
Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
I certainly hope so -- I loved Susan from the moment she was born, and I love her now, and every minute in between, and what I dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.
Are you threatening me?
Looks like he lied to you too.
I'm coming.
I got a half a tank. You?
Yeah. So you can call me if you need help.
Bet they don't dust crops in Japan.
You hear my okay?
I don't know.
Maybe. Sure sure, I've thought about it. Who hasn't? If I ever met the right sort of a girl, I'd Yeah, but where you going to find her somebody that's real somebody that's alive? They don't come that way any more.
Me?
Make that 1790.
I mean I've checked everything. Women. Liquor... Finances. I went all the way back to his high school race for student body president.
What do you mean, he's clean?
I'm sorry everyone, but given this extraordinary turn of events, I think it's prudent that we cut the evening short. I'm sure this Cuban thing will resolve itself, but in the meantime...I'd suggest taking a prayerful watch-and-wait stance!
Rick is completely neutral about everything. And that takes in the field of women, too.
Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before. Bet ya twenty bucks. Make that shot just the way I made it before.
Clean.
Set 'em up again... C'mon, set 'em up again.
You're drunk, boy. I'm not gonna bet ya any more.
Let's get back on the road. You gotta be at that convention in the morning.
Up the flagpole with the convention. C'mon, Charlie. You're into me now. I got my money on the table.
I don't know if obsessions have reasons. I think that's why they're obsessions.
I'm kind of obsessed by it, actually.
So it could have been neither of them?
Tomorrow.
...I just saw my doctor, he told me everything was fine.
Bye.
Oh, no I won't my dear - oh, no I won't my dear - I'll wash behind my ears, but no I won't my dear!
Got my initials on them too. They're cute. They're nice little things - what do you do with them?
Oh no. No, no. Not me. I haven't worn these things for Years.
Besides I'd look foolish. I couldn't look Gallagher in the face.
Honey, I love you. I'll eat spinach for you. I'll go to the dentist twice a year for you. I'll wash behind my ears for you. But I will never wear garters!
No -- I wanted to be a professional hockey player.
Yes, it's a girl I saw at the station.
The size of the lungs has nothing to do with it!
As I said, second of all you're too skinny. You've got tiny lungs. I still don't understand how you can dive without getting sick.
Just this minute. I'm Wyatt Earp, These're my brothers-
Say nothing. Nothing 'bout her.
I've talked to your father.
Whatever you need. Whatever Jamie needs. I'm here. I could start by driving her to school --
How 'bout you go to the movies with me tonight?
Okay. What's the second thing?
Delly... thanks, thank you. I'll take good care of this.
Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector. You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers...
Damn...
Ah, I got a date tonight with that Mary girl I told you about.
The sawbones?
Yep.
So where the hell are you, Healy?
No point, it'll be in Czech and God knows what format. But if I'm right, they could be my ticket out of here.
What happened to those disks I gave you, have you still got them?
Suppose those contained all the file info too? You could have a third or so of it there.
Maybe, but I've started to wonder what those files were all about. Suppose it was old KGB stuff and had the dirt on big people or maybe the personnel records of the secret police, that might explain all the hassle and the cover-up.
It was all in Czech wasn't it.
Not too bad.
I woulda' been here sooner, but Ballard put me in jail. He still thinks you had Del scalped.
You're in serious danger!
Good-bye.
Betty! Boy, am I glad to see you!
Now?
What did she say?
Any signs of biological contamination, excessive radiation, anything like that?
Not on the landscape. We're trying to get a tube under the faceplate for a reading on possible deadly lifeforms but it's hard going.
This has always been my favorite time of day.
Very beautiful country up here...
But "if it came to it" then it couldn't have your-- --nose. How perfect does your child have to be?
You remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron? It's the exact height of the front fender. Looked right instead of left.
Where do we start?
What do you know, they moved it. Catch you later.
I see what you mean... You're a beautiful guy. And you're doing a damn good job.
Are any of those right?
Yes, you. We're looking for our room... 1002.
Could be.
Then why aren t you asking the police to look for your son, Mrs Spitz?
Appearances can be deceptive, Mrs De Moraes.
I take it your son is not married, Mrs Spitz?
This is Marc Shermin. Where are you, Mrs. Haydn?
It's valuable. Hang onto it.
I'll be back as quick as I can. Thirty-six hours at the outside.
No, no. Forgive me. I made a mistake. It was an inappropriate thing to ask.
Yo, I'm not comfortable either.
It's okay.
Please, Eddie, no 'Fat Lady Sings" shit.
They're all the same.
But who is he? What are his creden- tials? What is his relationship to you?
In English, please.
I don't believe they'll expect that.
I believe so. Saw it on a television show, once.
Unless we set Charenton on a straight and narrow course, she'll be shut down forever by order of the Emperor.
Yes?
In their eyes, the Marquis is the surest barometer of your progress here.
Shut down?
All France is aghast at this book, yet you've not heard of it?
You have to believe me, I had no idea --
Abbe, I admire you; I do. You've a conviction... an idealism... peculiar to the very young. And so I'll be candid. The Ministry has sent me here with the most explicit... the most severe instructions.
I've taken vows to live my life within these walls; not outside them.
Have you tried bleeding him with leeches? The calming chair? Maybe you should flog him at the stake?
But he's one among some two hundred wards --
Mickey, how do you feel about cross- examining Grace Mulberry?
Now listen, Ann he can't possibly get in without our seeing him. I'm watching the side door and the Colonel's out front, so stop worrying.
You know, eat healthier.
-- Made. Made. Marvin Gaye is dead, his father shot him in --
-- Alright, alright but --
How can you like Art Garfunkel and Marvin Gaye? It's like saying you support the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Hey! Marvin Gaye! "Got to Give It Up!" That's our song! Marvin Gaye is responsible for our entire relationship!
Jets.
I hate to tell you guys, but only two out of every class make it into jets. Which one of you is going with me?
You have my word. As a gentleman
How do you get your hair to look like that?
You got something on your mind?
Not with your hairdresser.
East Rutherford.
I never thought I'd ever see Ozzy live until he was dead. Please tell me you like metal.
Next time. Tonight, I want to share the most beautiful thing I could possibly imagine.
Ok, whatever you think... I'm lost.
Gotta go.
But --
There is. I suggest that you ask your wife.
I beg your pardon?
I said, ask your wife.
My wife?
Well, at least she ain't married to no white man's nigger! You been stoopin' so long, Reverend, you don't even know how to stand straight no more. You' just half a man!
You see what I mean? If Laszlo's presence in a cafe can inspire this unfortunate demonstration, what more will his presence in Casablanca bring on? I advise that this place be shut up at once.
But everybody's having such a good time.
Very simple. Just bring him to... that place we been using. Mac, you take care of the details. Call Gerry G. in if you think you need him.
Gerry G!! You don't want to do that, Johnny! Sure the boy's outa line, but he's just a confused kid.
So do I, Charley. For your sake.
What do you want me to do, Johnny?
I ain't interested in his mental condition. All I want to know is, is he D 'n D or is he a canary?
I wish I knew.
This girl and the Father got their hooks in him so deep he doesn't know which end is up anymore.
He was always a good kid. You know that.
...I can't haul meat no more.
We hear this is getting to be sort of a meeting place for the Wynant family, so we figure we'll stick around in case the old man himself shows up. Then we seen him... ...sneak in and we decide to come up. And pretty lucky for you.
No.
I guess a lot of those tall buildings we saw this morning are new.
It's fine. Just give it a try. And for gosh sake, Eve, take your foot off the chair!
About clothing?
Isn't it a little tiring to sit up straight like that?
Whatever you two want. If you've got the time, I've got the wazoo.
What about Johnny?
Alright. Alright. There will be nothing left.
The recovery is very impressive.
Almost all of them.
I've got you.
I'll be alive when I get out, Charlie.
Looks more like a morgue to me. Those pool tables are the slabs they lay the stiffs on.
It's quiet.
Their true name is Sequoia Sempervirens: always green, ever- living.
Why?
Yes. It's the same as usual. Nothing remarkable about it at all.
Me too, Boris.
Does it snow in Bombay? One winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a coffin !
Then I suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!
Anyway, I was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available-- I didn't think you'd be interested.
No, I mean, no big whoop.
Two thousand francs.
It's a hat, Comrade, a woman's hat.
This is the apartment we have reserved for you, Comrade Yakushova. I hope you like it.
Why not?
Oh yeah? How is it?
What are you drinking?
Okay! Fuck!
I'd like to ask you a few questions.
You-you play... very well.
It was the only thing I've ever asked him!
I told him to leave me alone.
I haven't danced in.....
Well, I'll be a son of a sea cook!
But you'll never be whole again.
Yes.
Follow that boat!
So. You found him.
Growing a beard...
So they united.
Well, they'll go along with anything.
Hear!
Hear, hear!
Well, I-I guess if you live in Chelsea, that's probably first.
Y-you live in Chelsea, don't you?
Interesting business.
And then, uh, April...huh?
This is neither the time nor the place --
But why heap such ghastly fantasies atop an already ghastly existence?
How long has it been?
Well I'm not so go home.
It's nice to see you again.
No! What do you want here? How do you know me?
It's a sign.
Perfect. We'll be there.
Why'd you do it? What'd I ever do to you?!?
You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.
It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada!
What the fuck is this guy doing?
All right. Die, Granada Jocks!
They're not going to jail.
I take it you don't like Miss Lawson very much?
You don't really believe what the district attorney is saying about Miss Lawson, do you?
If you don't know her that well what makes you think she's capable of murder?
That's the craziest thing I ever heard. Absolutely not.
How'd you get into the shipbuilding business, Gavin?
What was I saying?
When'd you get this?
Am I being interrogated? You should be trying to trick me. Ask me about Tottenham Hotspur. Or Buckingham Palace. About Marmite - I was addicted. Or make me speak German, which I can, by the way.
I'm fine.
Yes, please. I'm looking for all beef patties.
Nothing.
There's no call for that, Sam. Fella made himself a pile of enemies over the years.
Okay, bye, I will.
Me? Sure I do.
That's what you said the other night.
I don't want to go back tomorrow.
Go on a little present from your Uncle Johnny. And Mac, tomorra mornin' when you shape the men put Terry in the loft. Number one. Every day. Nice easy work. Check in and goof off on the coffee bags. O.K.?
I'm gonna grab you. I didn't mean it to be a question. I'm gonna grab you.
I'm too old for it, Miss Wells... That's for little kids.
Gee, I can't.
Sure. You'll find it under the wagon seat. Like I said before, a twenty- two's more your size.
Can I have my gun back?
That's right, Steve.
A man can't help gettin' excited once in a while.
Good thing you didn't.
Stu? Stu? Let's not disturb the nice Reaper.
Mmmm.
Yes, Eve?
No.
But it just wasn't where I wanted to be so I left as politely as I could and found a taxi. But I asked the driver to drop me here instead of at the hotel. There's a song Mister Como sings called "On the Street Where You Live." You know it?
"All at once am I--several stories high-- knowing I'm--on the street-- where you live." It's about a young man who is overjoyed just to be standing in front of the house of the person he loves.
What are you writing?
Yeah. For a little while.
No. I think his widow's still in their place in Darktown, though. You think it's Charley Wade, huh?
Oh -- you must know me -- Kringelein at the plant. Assistant bookkeeper, building C, room twenty-three -- third floor.
I must speak with you, Miss Flaemm.
It's urgent.
Insolent -- Berlin manners.
Pardon me, the lady has urgent business here with me.
I don't know you.
I wish you a very good evening, Mr. Preysing. You are staying here, too, Mr. Preysing?
Why don't you let him sleep it off in the trunk. I'll take you for a ride. Then we'll come back for him. Keep an eye on him.
Gee. I'm sorry to hear that.
It would be a nice night to go for a walk, don't you think?
Forensics people are sure of it. You have any idea who might have put him there?
Senora Cruz?
My kinda group!
Go on talkin'. You're talkin' yourself right into the river. Go on, go on... .
You want to know something? Take the heater away and you're nothin' take the good goods away, and the kickback and the shakedown cabbage away and the pistoleros away and you're a great big hunk of nothing Your guts is all in your wallet and your trigger finger!
You ratted on us, Terry.
Go on beat it. Don't push your luck.
Listen, Johnny
I said beat it! At the right time I'll catch up with you. Be thinkin' about it.
You want to know somethin' ?
Come on. I want you. You're mine. You're mine! Come on!
From where you stand, maybe. But I'm standing over here now. I was rattin' on myself all them years and didn't know it, helpin' punks like you against people like Pop and Nolan an'... .
Judy, you've got to do this for me! Please!
Can you develop an ulcer in two minutes? Being cool is hard on your body.
We'll take it! Will it fit?
Parasite!
Harold!
Crazy parasite! Commie bastard! Get out of here.
Boy, to think I could maybe make my own.
Harold! That's disgusting!
Traitor! Benedict Arnold! Remember Nathan Hale, right, sir?
Mr. Harris, a guest of yours, is a guest of ours and shall be treated accordingly. The young lady asked me to tell you that she is waiting for you in the lounge.
The young lady staying in your room?
No -- but look -- maybe we could do something else together, Mrs. Robinson -- would you like to go to a movie.
My what?
You're welcome.
Mrs. Robinson -- I can't do this.
This is all terribly wrong.
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson. I think -- I think you're the most attractive of all my parents' friends. I just don't think we could possibly --
Thank you.
That what she was... a Norfolk Deb?
Tell Bill to get the fuck off!
Have you got your gun on now?
Here, just have one of these then.
It's me. Martin Blank.
The Perdido thing?
I'm just saying -- we have one night to ourselves, why do we have to spend it here?
It's big enough to keep you out of the war, I suppose. Ain't that right?
Yes, so what. It's nothing serious, really. Just a small defect.
They told me I was too old to serve.
Right.
Not yet. Not married.
There's a little something wrong with it. Just this part here--the right ventricle. It's slightly enlarged.
I'd like to... take you out or something.
You don't want to go home, do you?
Ow!!
I agree with you--no gentleman, would--But I would-- --especially when my opponents have taken the precaution of marking the cards.
No gentleman would do that.
Well, to tell you the truth, gentlemen, I've sworn off playing poker.
Maybe you will after you've thought it over.
I have no life. My brother Johnny took my life from me.
You keep it nice. Can I ask you, is this-is this a sandwich?
That's okay, you... we-we can walk to the curb from here.
Yeah. I got, uh, I got a license but I have too much hostility.
Nice car.
I have no life.
You want your tennis stuff?
You get the feeling he doesn't want to be here?
'Twill serve. Ask for me tomorrow and you shall find me a grave man. A plague o' both your houses. They have made worms meat of me. A plague on both your Houses! Why the devil did you come between us? I was hurt under your arm.
Do uh... Sorry. Can you follow me? Do you understand what I'm saying?
And how was the flight. Sorry, am I speaking too fast for you?
Do you follow or should I speak slower?
Good. Or should I speak slower?
Uh... Are you a giraffe?
How's business?
Then why'd you get married? I'm asking you as a friend.
Hey, Ben. Thanks for coming down.
You mind if I ask a few questions about your husband? Roderick?
Poor George . . . Sit down.
Sam the Man.
He'll be atop the portculis ere long.
Best get down close to the moat, lad.
Aye. We're good as inside.
It's what we'll find there worries me.
I came here, looking for her.
Hey, will you just leave me alone?
Come on. Invite me. All day the idea of a family Sunday dinner's been coming into my head. Since you're the only one I know around here with family...
Hey, what about Sunday dinner? When're you gonna let me know?
Lead the way.
You must be my son.
It must be tough being married to Adonis to end up sleeping alone every night. Sleep must be hard coming. What s harder? The thought of the fine litter you two could have bred if? Or imagining what he does with his children?
...'Shnook'? 'Dope'? 'Dipstick'? 'Lamebrain'?
Sure, sure. And did your classmates there call you 'jerk' or... ...'schmoe'?
At the Muncie College of Business Administration.
You're fired.
Get your feet off that desk.
But, sir! --
Snoopy Miller, famous fight thrower.
You devil, it's mace, huh? What've you got here, a billy? Use it on poor unfortunate offenders.
Where's your gun, your pistol?
And I'll be a visitor.
Oh hi. It's William Thacker. We, ahm I work in a bookshop.
Right. Great. Classic. Classic.
Do you remember the date when you saw Miss Lawson in the bathroom?
How do you know it was cocaine that Miss Lawson had in the bathroom?
Yes, Jackie Shawn, my wi -- Felicia.
Well anyway...
It's just -- fabulous. Think you could do anything for me?
Get out. The evil finger's on you. Get out!
But she's on the telephone
Who?
Madame Pomponi is on the telephone, sir.
What do you mean by coming in here when I'm playing?
Madame Pomponi. She says everything is all set for the reception.
Couple of months anyway.
Smart gal.
No. Nobody but you.
What else, stupid! You don't think we're after that penny-ante reward, do you? Ten thousand bucks? Chicken feed! We're holding her for a million smackers.
First, I'm goin' to Israel for a year, study the Talmud, work on a Kibbutz... then come back, maybe take some tennis lessons.
See! I can't tell them that! I can't ever let them know. It makes their life..well, frankly... a joke. I can't let that happen. You understand?
My mother's like that.
Hi. Hi.
I don't know.
I don't know, Rose. I don't know where I've been, and I don't know where I'm going. You should have your eyes opened for you, my friend.
I have my eyes open.
Hello, Mr. Castorini.
Your boy, there--
Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin' you know to make things pleasant.
Wife?
Well, you're two up on me now.
There's a seat over there for you.
I'll pay.
We'll go to my bank. I'll make a withdrawal.
Will she like it?
Yeah, Kim told me they were giving you their Dueling Scarlet's act. Actually, they're sophomores at Juilliard.
Oh -- oh!
I hate to disturb you, but something came up -- it's rather important -- and I think it would be a good idea if you could see me -- at the apartment -- as soon as possible.
Hello? -- yes -- what's on your mind, Baxter?
Thanks, guys... I'd like to go with you. But I've got to move on.
What?
Reggie, push off and hit, man. Push him off.
You best find me another ranked contender an' I mean in a flash, man!
Yes -- sort of...
Well, about six months ago -- I was going to night school, taking this course in Advanced Accounting -- and one of the guys in our department -- he lives in Jersey -- he was going to a banquet at the Biltmore -- his wife was meeting him in town, and he needed someplace to change into a tuxedo -- so I gave him the key and word must have gotten around -- because the next thing I knew, all sorts of guys were suddenly going to banquets -- and when you give the key to one guy, you can't say no to another and the whole thing got out of hand -- pardon me.
Baxter, an insurance company is founded on public trust. Any employee who conducts himself in a manner unbecoming -- How many charter members are there in this little club of yours?
No, sir. I'm not going to deny it. But if you'd just let me explain --
You better.
Oh.
Are you going to deny it?
Who?
Loyal, cooperative, resourceful C. C. Baxter.
Sir?
There's a certain key floating around the office -- from Kirkeby to Vanderhof to Eichelberger to Dobisch -- it's the key to a certain apartment -- and you know who that apartment belongs to?
What happened to Gibarian?
All right.
I want to hear your version.
I am here to recover this mission, report my findings, and make a recommendation. Now: What happened to him?
Well, that's the one that explains how Jimmy Wang Yu became the Incredible One-Armed Boxer.
Will you be my wife?
Soon as we leave here. Stop home and pick up what we need and go do it.
Why, I believe the little woman cares.
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Goodbye, darling.
That's... well, that's very generous, but if you've already got a store...?
Sure I will.
This shit can't be real.
Might as well siddown a minute, Clara.
I offered her, Ma, she don't want nothing.
How'd you come home, Ma? Thomas give you a ride?
Oh, she's coming, eh, Ma?
Yeah, and dangerous.
Nothing you wouldn't have done it my place!
Airk! Come on, Airk. Lemme outa here.
Gimme a sword, Airk. I'll win your war for you.
I don't understand, Jeanne... why did you do it? Why?
Well, I'm not saying that I want to join or anything, but...but I know you guys believe in reincarnation, you know, so it interests me.
Look Jim. Far be it from me to tell you what to do, but there's--
Well--
What's that got to do with it?
You what?
Did anyone see you there? I mean did they get your license number or anything?
I don't think so--
This one's for both of us.
Nice girl, that-- I'd hate to see her get a raw deal. You know, the great trouble with crooks is they're too smart. Now if I'd taken that bracelet, I'd find some way to slip it back--I'd know I could never get ashore with it.
Two weeks, three at the most, Aaaagh! For pity's sake.
When?
All right, folks, get on your mark. When you hear the pistol shot--
Wouldn't bet against her. Tell you what I will do--bet you I find that bracelet before we hit France. Not a hundred, though--just fifty.
Sophia. Hello Sophia. Mine's still John.
Have you got a cigarette?
Yeah, and needless to say, none of us has that kind of money lying around.
A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely.
Oh.
It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly.
Should I be expecting him anytime soon?
'Cause I just don't buy it. Call it instinct. Call it 35 years of professional know-how...
I call it 'nutty' as my shit after I eat Almond Roca...
I never said that I believed...
No, you believed her, we drove all the way to L.A. so that means you trusted her that much... so why's the rest of her story suddenly so kooky? Huh?
You gimme this bullshit Psychic Friends theory, you believe that dumbshit trucker, you believe this woman...
No, no, Betty came here strictly for business, 'cause it's the biggest market for what she's selling. I should have known it all along. I'm kicking myself as I shave here. So, first thing we...
Wait, wait, wait a minute... that doesn't make sense.
You need to remember who you're talking to...
I need to get my goddamn head examined. You can't rule something out on a whim. Or because she's cute. I've been following your whims all across the U.S. of A. and now I'm tired! Me!
'Bout even.
When do I raise the bet?
You hustlin' me?
I'm sure Mr. Felson knows what he's doing. Certainly you can afford a hundred dollars to find out.
You ever played billiards before?
Sure.
Oh no, nothing for me.
How do we stand?
Deal the cards.
Beautiful shot, Felson. Beautiful. You've played billiards before, Mr. Felson. Ah, you gentlemen sure you don't care for a drink?
No.
I forgot. You never drink with... I'll have another, please. You despise me, don't you?
Oh, nothing. But when you first came to Casablanca, I thought --
-- You thought what?
May I? Too bad about those two German couriers, wasn't it?
They got a lucky break. Yesterday they were just two German clerks. Today they're the 'Honored Dead'.
You are a very cynical person, Rick, if you'll forgive me for saying so.
Thank you. Will you have a drink with me please?
I think you're a very nice... very nice psychotic man. I really appreciate what you did for me. It was a very brave and noble thing...
I'm pleased you're not troubled by the prospect...
When you are ripe for my pleasure, I will enjoy the harvest.
Yes?
My dear Princess, the human soul is a highly elusive commodity. I suggest you spend some hours before the glass. Contemplate your intriguing reflection and consider whether such a creature as yourself could possibly possess something as fine and beautiful as a soul.
No.
Good night Cecile.
I just came to say goodbye.
Back to the city. I may take off to Europe for the rest of the summer. I just can't handle it around here.
Put his feet in.
Miles -- why so angry?
Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
Oh, that noise! Yes, he certainly did.
So, so you want to go out to dinner again? I mean, is that, is that... Have, you have any interest in that, or...
I was the, I was... You know, it was my fault. I--
What are you looking at?
-- yeah.
Am I entertaining you?
-- sure.
Bad example. Just trust me. A woman who loves you keeps you going...gives you strength... Makes you feel like you can do anything...
What?
Get the hell in.
Hun -- this is Anna. Anna -- this is Honey -- she's my baby sitter.
Hello, Anna ahm... Scott -- have some wine.
Max. This is Anna.
Curly Bill, huh? Who was that Other idiot?
Can you use your magic to get our men into the fortress, Raziel?
Hell, I don't belong here. I don't know what I' been thinkin'.
Ain't your fault.
Yeah. It's just like I figured.
And since we're talking, my wife and I don't want you hanging around our daughter.
Well, that figures. Kind of fits in with everything else, don't it!
Open my eyes -- Please, open my eyes!
Vacation? Christ, Charlie, it's a Monday night. You said so yourself.
So?
You really think so?
I've got the grands for two nights, Charlie. You can't just --
What're you saying, Charlie?
So, what, uh, what train are you taking?
One thing about them though, they're faithful. They get married just like people.
Oh, I see.
Let's continue.
What? Are you all right?
No. Are you crazy?
You first.
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Yes, sir.
Well, it wasn't exactly that way --
Goodbye, Yonson.
My lead bird. He's always on that top perch.
Think of the fun we can have - we'll sneak down the back stairs and get in the valet's Ford. How's that?
I'll tell you what let's do - I'll take you and introduce you to all my gang. Would you like that?
I don't mean the newspaper fellows that you don't like. Another gang I know - you'd love them. They're writers and musicians and artists - a great crowd of people - people who do great things. People who are worthwhile.
Oh, they're all right, Anne. But I
A.M -- or P.M.?
You see that's what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?
...Stop jivin'!
Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
How do you like that one?
But don't you do anything. You just have a seat, wait for me to get there.
They were all gonna jump me back There. What ever happened to one Against one?
Yeah, wasn't I?
But you're not out of the woods yet, Baxter -- because most of them try it again! You know where I am if you need me.
Oh -- Mrs. Lieberman.
Help yourself.
I don't know what you did to that girl in there -- and don't tell me -- but it was bound to happen, the way you carry on. Live now, pay later. Diner's Club! Why don't you grow up, Baxter? Be a mensch! You know what that means?
I'm not sure.
A mansch -- a human being! So you got off easy this time -- so you were lucky --
Last night?
All Europe shall hear of this!
It is shameful -- infamous! I insist upon being put down at the Austrian ambassador's house.
Ten thousand? But the scoundrel owes me seventy thousand.
Where is my rascal, Lazlo?
Good gracious! What is this?
No shit. The Iceman....
Who's your pilot?
This is Evan Mitchell, he steers the thing.
You think you can stay up with us.
Don't kill yourself, man -- Let the doctor stop the fight.
And he was with her.
You were him last night, weren't you?
Don't forget me.
We?
Oh?
Life is confusing, isn't it?
What is it, a still life?
Why, of course you can. Come on in the office here.
Here, now, you're broke, aren't you?
Would you like to read it? It's to you.
What do you want to do, hock your furs, and that hat? Want to walk to New York? You know, they charge for meals and rent up there just the same as they do in Bedford Falls.
I am only insinuating that you are nervous.
Yeah. To watch the world go by.--
The one who came with your letter?
I love that car.
Where've you been?
I'm just trying to find an explanation for the continual reappearances.
When you cut yourself pounding the door, did it hurt?
Are the actions of Solaris premeditated?
Is it being deliberately cruel, you mean? I don't think so.
I'm living here while I build another house.
Alyssa.
Don't you have school?
What's today?
All my life, I've wanted somebody to talk to. Back in Mandrake Falls, I always used to talk to a girl.
Mary, I'm going home.
All right.
Just dumb luck. I delivered a pie to her one night and she answered the door in her nightgown -- that was it for me. I went home that night, shaved my beard, and a week later I was laid out in her office with a broken back.
And how come you call yourselves Cowboys? Cowhands ride for the brand.
Detroit. Snoopy Miller told me uncut diamonds are as easy to move as cash.
I'm using an old phonographic turntable.
Yo' bleedin' inside, man -- Get that doctor.
I've almost finished the rocker. Did she order mirrors?
So. What's your point?
Smythe! Well, well, well! With a Y , huh? Congratulations! What a small world. Brothers under livery. Shake! Now, as a Smith to a Smythe
Now, now Jeeves. Was that nice? Was that being a gentleman, Jeeves? Was it, Jeeves? Your name is Jeeves, isn't it?
Well, you're my pal, aren't you? Then don't turn female on me.
There you go, talking like a woman!
Gallagher! She's the real McCoy!
I haven't looked at myself yet. I figured I could tell from your reaction.
Oh, you-you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?
Me, no. You... I-I-you know, if I have grass or alcohol or anything I get unbearably wonderful. I get too, too wonderful for words. You know, I don't-I don't know why you have to, uh, get high every time we make love.
Yeah, grass, right? The illusion that it will make a white woman more like Billie Holiday.
No, don't be silly. What-what do we need other people for? You know, we should-we should just turn out the lights, you know, and play hide and seek or something.
Well, I'll give you a shot of sodium pentothal. You can sleep through it.
What are you going to do?
Orsino good name
Sold in marriage and half way to America.
Objection! Speculation.
You re judging me?! Oh, that s a good one. You re lying to me, you re lying to your family, and you re lying to yourself. But you re going to stand there and point a finger at me? The man you hired to pretend to be your boyfriend?
Why not a hundred and fifty percent?
-- So much for the icebreakers. What're you after, Ruth?
You have some?
You think he's lying?
I'm serious. You don't know me and I know nothing about you. We have a perfect relationship.
I'm sorry I woke you up.
No, thank you. Just keep me company for a while.
I keep having these really terrible dreams. They are getting worse and I can't seem to stop them.
Will you come with me?
I know. But still. Six months. I think you oughta either find a different job or a different boyfriend. Cause there may be men who don't mind being the maid and getting nothing in return, but I'm sure as shit not one of 'em.
Thanks, Dad, this talk helped. Will you sign it, please?
Crank her!
Cut it out, Susan. You and I've got to talk. Big day tomorrow, everybody. Joe, let's go.
No. But, honest. What are you supposed to say when they keep talking about your looks? I don't even know what they mean -- "Beat them off with a stick."
Proud? I'm just embarrassed that I like when they say those things.
It's not.
I got my report card. Three Cs, two Ds and an incomplete.
I'll just have to try harder. I don't know. I will. I will. I will. I will.
Well, I'd like to welcome Annie and Grace to their first branding...
Or looked so beautiful...
Later, beloved... Now I wish only to be with you...
I'm very interested in that body.
Not everyone, Miss Daniels.
I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
I'll take care of him.
Uh.. Have you tried the Diva's suite?
When is she not in trouble?
Leeloo's in trouble?
Only 'cause my wife likes your wife!
It's not mine either.
No, you did it yourself. Maybe in your sleep.
I'll leave the plane in the hangar at Kufra Oasis. So if you need it hard to know how long one's talking about. We might all be back in a month or two.
Tomorrow afternoon. Don't worry. I'll be ready.
Ah. A classic...
Bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. I'm going to do what I can, but And D'Ag turns out to be a great admirer of Mussolini. So now you can say I told you so.
Right.
We didn't care about countries. Did we? Brits, Arabs, Hungarians, Germans. None of that mattered, did it? It was something finer than that.
When's Clifton picking you up?
Yes. It was. Thanks for the compass. I'll look after it for you.
How about -- "I hope you'll be very happy together"?
A little longer for me.
Adrian, you gotta come back to Hell. Dad's sick.
I... I don't know why I just said that. I meant to say that...
ADRIAN!
Don't you remember what they called you?
Mike. Oh, the christening. I meant to call...
Yeah, right. I don't know why I bothered inviting you guys. I knew you wouldn't show.
I think it's gonna be a waste of time.
What about that psychic, what's his name, Szabo?
Hey! Mr. big shot.
I'll be at Bedford tonight, if you need me.
We should get you to the doctor.
Oh, well, I can't . . .
What? Whatever you want, Helen!
No. I think it's just right.
Yes!
Is there a problem?
I've noticed.
Nothing.
Just finishing up in here.
Likewise. And draw two for chasers. Now you're beginning to live.
Okay.
Look young lady, I grew up through the depression. I fought in the second World War. Six days a week I get up and deal with the public, the bank and the bill collectors. And on the seventh day, when God rests, I don't have to listen to my daughter calling me a fool!
How do you like it?
Yeah. Sure. Had me going for a while.
Wouldn't have made a bad story, would it?
Just have you for one second, please.
If anything, I'm making it sound good. Let's face it, Lisa... you aren't made for that kind of a life. Few people are.
Nah. Sit tight. He'll be over here.
Are you ready for another?
Hey, Findley's here.
Where?
Over there by the bar.
Aren't you gonna go over and talk to him?
Well, that old lovin' horse paid twenty-two forty. Let's see... two hundred I won from the jockey last night. And today at the track... I got five hundred and forty bucks. Here, you hold it.
Just for luck.
I saw Judith's parents while you were at the apartment... I wanted to say something... But I... I was so relieved that Grace was still... that it wasn't our daughter.
No, let me go.
Yes.
Sorry to barge in on you. Anybody else here besides you two?
This your place?
Good deal... Oh, uh, we're on the run and we'd like to hang out here for a while. Couple of hours, maybe. How'd that be?
Low mileage... Handles like a dream.
I know that Richard. I don't think I'll need it. But something this last week has taught me, it's better to have a gun and not to need it than to need a gun and not to have it.
No.
Piano.
My brother and I. One each.
Why you shaking me off?
You're eighteen. You don't know what you want. You won't know until you're forty-five and you don't have it.
But he ain't seen my heat--
Well, yes, I'm killing time. I have a client near here and I...I'm quite early.
You know how it'll come out and feel... y'know... little more, little more... Yeah, yeah, that's right. Go round just at first, keep it in first, just feel it.
You should be.
Quitter.
How's that?
I'm afraid I already know a great many people. Until one of them dies I couldn't possibly meet anyone else.
Yes, of course. But you will let me know if anyone goes on the critical list
Why, do you think we're going to?
I don't know -- how would I know?
It's hers. Where'd you find him, robbing a bank?
He was throwing snowballs at Baron Rothschild. We don't know each other, do we?
You give up awfully easy, don't you?
Thank God. I could eat a horse if you slap enough catsup on it.
Live with what?
Australia.
Dobisch -- Joe Dobisch, in Administration.
Oh, yes, Mr. Dobisch. I didn't recognize your voice --
That's okay, Buddy-boy. Now like I was saying, I'm in this joint on Sixty-first -- and I think I got lucky -- -- she's a skater with the Ice Show -- -- and I thought maybe I could bring her up for a quiet drink.
I'm sorry, Mr. Dobisch. You know I like to help you guys out -- but it's sort of late -- so why don't we make it some other time?
Yes -- Australia, and you must have suspected I would have known the powder's origin, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 46.
Things 're lookin' up on the docks, huh, Jackie?
By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
Steal it how?
May I have a cigarette, please?
No. I won't be long.
You're not. We're level. Look at the instruments, we're okay!
Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
You're crazy. We're level.
Helping him in.
Up on your feet! We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries!
Yes?
I think.. I...I realized...I love you.
Beautiful night huh?
Yeah.....Hey they're moving.... Am I doing that?
Dropped him, that was it. Sorry If I made a worse mess for you.
I'm the one made a mess. Made a Right fair mess of the whole thing.
I never met her.
You've been in this house for a while?
Yes it does.
Can you love a fool?
Lady?
Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
... yes, I follow your thinking on that.
I wanna hear it from you!
... how am I gonna tell you what they have against you? I mean Jesus fucking Christ, they're women, aren't they? Have you ever listened to women talk, man? Have you? Well I do, I do 'til it's fucking coming out of my ears. I'm on my feet all day, every fucking day, listening to women talk and you know what they talk about, don't you? Being fucked up by some guy. That's all that's on their minds. I'm sure you've done something they could get pissed off about, what's that got to do with it? All women are pissed off, man, all of 'em. They fucking hate us! Don't you know that?
Yes, you can tell me about the minor cut you found on the deceased's right hand. The report says 'recent origin'. How recent? As much as 24 hours before death?
Are you absol...
Now, if you'll just point me in the right direction . . . This direction? Good night, Mrs. Bailey.
Jeanne, no...
That's good.
I don't care what they say, you're a winner.
So who's the guy?
Well -- my wife got this new job...
You go back, I'll walk.
Oh, I get the idea. Yeah, maybe.
One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
I wish he had a family, though.
Yeah, maybe.
What's your name?
Right in there, pal.
If I'm not out in a half hour, send for the paramedics.
God, even you want to tell me what I can't do. In case you hadn't noticed, Anton, I don't need rescuing. But you did, once.
Rick, I'm concerned.
About what?
This is your bachelor party. You haven't had sex with anyone yet.
Get a few drinks into me, we'll dance and see what happens.
I got something you can't resist. I have a friend, Tracey. She wants to meet you. She loves to please.
Oooooo.
I thought we'd suspended negotiations, gentlemen.
It's no big deal, whatever I mean, if you want.
Great. Great. So listen, uh, I was wondering if maybe you wanted to go to the prom you know, with me.
So what's up?
Yeah, Conundrum.
No, I didn't. What I said was that my agent had heard there was some interest at Conundrum...
I don't know. Senior editor? Sounds like you're in to me.
...and that one of the editors was passing it up to a senior editor. She was supposed to hear something this week, but now it's next week, and... It's always like this. It's always a fucking waiting game. I've been through it too many times already.
It's a long shot, all right? And Conundrum is just a small specialty press anyway. I'm not getting my hopes up. I've stopped caring. That's it. I've stopped caring.
Come on, we're celebrating. I say we pop it.
Don't open that now. It's warm.
It is. Yes -- that's where they had Rorish, for God's sake, before they made him anchor. I can't stand it -- they're grooming you for it all and you don't even know it.
That's a 1992 Byron. It's really rare. Don't open it now. I've been saving it!
London. That's a promotion!
I don't think so.
Yes. And I'm sorry that they're sending you down for a while, but you'll make it back...Where they sending you?
London.
So I quit.
You packing up tonight?
Absolutely not.
Which was?
So what do I do then?
Really?
I don't freak out very often.
To finish last evening's delightful work.
Can I see you later?
Has he hurt you?
Don't be absurd; it's only a play.
You mean to take us all down with you?
It was fiction, of course.
It was not inspired by circumstance.
Of course.
Then we should have had lunch at the bank.
And I love my fans, of which he is one. Wanna thank them for all my Sundays, and of course my Monday nights too. That about says it...
I... I love everybody, man. I love my wife. My kids. Little Tyson. My new baby Kaydee. My brother Tee Pee. I love my friends, my teammates, who am I leaving out?
Takes a lot out of you, one like this.
Diane! Alright, let's stop this right now. Let's not put our energy into something ridiculous. This isn't even smart thinking.
How can you do it to yourself?
Ligourin: How could you do it?
What?
We haven't talked since college and now you wait two weeks before my wedding to say something like this?
What the devil do you want? Listen, Bruce, you can't come in here now! We're busy! Where you been, Duffy? Stick around! What? What Chinese earthquake? The deuce with it... what's that?
Hildy!
Hildy!
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy, get set! We've got the biggest story in the world. Earl Williams caught by the Morning Post -- exclusive!
Will you lighten up, please?
What about that D.B. Cooper guy?
Time comes, we knock on the door. See if he wants to talk about old times. Go in the easy way.
Yeah? You think he'll let us in, we got Snoopy and the muscle-bound asshole with us?
You don't look half-bad.
I don't believe what I'm seeing! Where've you been all your lives, at an orgy? Listening to Mick Jagger and bad mouthing your country, I'll bet.
Stop eyeballing me, boy! You are not worthy enough to look your superiors in the eye. Use your peripheral vision! Understand?!
Louder!
Now when I say "understand" I want the whole group to say, "Yes, sir!" Understand?
You have me word, lad. To answer a faerie riddle deserves as much.
I'm honored, Honeythorn Gump... but no more tricks.
You be our guest, Jack.
Well spoke. True to the mark. And if it's wine you're wanting, it's wine we shall have.
A riddle without an answer is but an empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.
Damnation! Codfish and cockles! Gammon and trotters! You've bested me, Jack.
The flower. Bluebells. To hear them ringing means your life's at an end.
What!
It's bluebells!
Hi.
You know how I feel. The world is random. The only certainty I believe in is death.
Between your book sales and this TV thing, there's going to be no living with you. And let me guess, you boiled God down to a conceit.
You ready?
How're you doing? Looking lovely as always.
She's a talk show host. They can't be charmed. By definition.
Do you think they have a room here?
I got a trunk in that room. Will you get it out for me?
One thousand?? That's an awful lot of oranges. You know there are pill, Lois. I've seen them.
Do you want me to do it?
Christ, Jack, it's her birthday.
Says who?
I don't?
Yep.
Mm hmm.
Goin' in. We got a sales convention. Gotta be there tomorrow.
I was gonna give you the money. Probably I was. Shit, I don't know, I don't know anything anymore.
... Sometimes they do.
Sometimes when I'm lonely.
She's...not here...she went out. She went out of town, she travels a lot.
...yeah.....
No.
You know. Your first campaign.
How's everything coming, Mr. Gayle?
Sit down.
No, man, no. You can say everybody's a whore. She's okay. I mean Jackie'll fuck around but not that much. Somewhere she really likes you, Lester, and it's not just the bread. She's okay.
Why?
... For the mermaids.
Italy!
Little. Very little. And skinny, very skinny too. That is compared to me.
We may have a chance.
Yes... a very slim one. I want to be fair. I don't deny that you might make out some kind of a case.
Get out of here!
Don't look so gloomy, gentlemen. All is not lost. You may have a chance.
What will be okay?
Well, gentlemen... how about a little lunch?
You still doin' it too fast!
Just tell me. Do you want me to go? Do you want me to stay?
This is easy--I'm not hurrying.
Why?! I'm finally throwin' the damn thing where I want to.
Can't you let me enjoy the moment?
Your fastball was up and your curveball was hanging--in the Show they woulda ripped you.
The moment's over. If this guy starts me off with a breaking ball, I'm going downtown--
Hey, I'm cruisin', man--what're you doing out here?!
Isn't she lovely?
I can talk it over; possibly I can get the money. When are you meeting the man?
Praise be to God.
I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
Then I'd kiss you without turning my garments inside-out and sewing bells all over.
Well done, lad. Stout heart.
I know... you don't know, I know.
Oh, hey, Studs? We thought you were somebody else.
Studs. Man, I haven't heard that since Lompoc. What's going on?
Klute, the Company's interest is Tom Grunemann. Solely and exclusively. You say you can't find Tom; all right, I'll see that you're paid off; the case is closed.
We've got a security camera in this bit of the shop.
I forgot to wave. We'll have it at the wedding.
George . . .
What is this, Uncle Billy? A holiday?
That does it come here.
I'll be back in a minute, Mary.
Just a minute, dear. Oh-oh . . .
What happened?
He's well-trained. He'll behave himself.
Outside of that.
I didn't mean to be that rough.
How long you talk to her?
No, I'm just running scared, same as everyone else.
Not me. So don't paw at me with your dirty little guild.
I always hated this song.
Yeah.
It's got nothing to do with marriage, if that's what you're getting at.
Mom! For the last fucking time, I'm telling you Laura didn't want to get married! She is not that kind of girl! To use a phrase. That's not what happens now.
That's her? Bianca's sister?
The mewling, rampalian wretch herself.
They're running the rest of me next month.
I guess I'm a slow learner.
Not yet, I'm afraid.
I'll see what I can do.
Well, at his age, twenty payment life, a little over a thousand dollars.
What do you mean, only an act? Haven't you got any feeling?
What do you mean?
All right, Hildy, I'm licked. But I'll make you and Bruce a business proposition.
Maybe you'll be. You're a smart young man. You let Hildy do this story for me and you can write out a 100,000.00 insurance policy for me. What do you say?
I don't use my wife for business purposes, Mr. Burns!
This is a whole different ball game, Erin. A much bigger deal.
You think there's more?
What did you think?
How about Roxy? Is she a fuck to the century, too?
How's your shoulder?
It hurts.
Yeah......yeah.....
Ok. Where are you from originally?
Ok. So you were married for how long?
Where you married?
This really looks like Hawaii here.
I love you.
Thank you, Melvin. You overwhelm me.
They did a nice job... Cozy, huh?
What are you talking about?
I'm sorry about this, Mr. Wyatt. I didn't know who she was.
Didn't you know she had a father and mother out here?
It's a long walk back to Aspen.
Hold on.
Next Wednesday I grab a grand from Snyder. An' Thursday two yards from Cappoli, okay?
No, wait... what happened next, Betty?
Where'd they take Lisa?
Ugly habit, biting your nails.
Can you keep a secret?
Yes.
I understand.
I'm allergic to it.
Take a look for yourself.
Yippy.
Awwwww!
No, not yet.
Everything is quite all right.
But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
What do you want me to start with -- the Golden Gate Bridge?
Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.
Jules, what's wrong...
Charley.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
I'll take it out of their skulls.
Don't hang on to me. And don't follow me. Don't follow me. Call the Father. Ask him to take care of Charley for me. My brother. There's something I got to do.
Your mother used to lay for her boss, boy. Did you know that?
'Don't sound so sure.
Good for you. Why shouldn t you protect what s yours.
Anyway, that never use to happen. I was always the prodigy. Now I'm just one of the guys.
Maybe some of the discomfort you're feeling is... guilt. Remorse. Over the innocent people you've killed.
What stuff?
It's making me hungry.
If I get antsy I'll kill a few small animals.
God. I can't believe it.
Really.
I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying?
Then it's settled. What time is dinner, Mother?
You are, aren't you?
...get away without thanking you in some small way. After all, you haven't even met Cathy and you are staying for the weekend...
Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right?
Nothin. Quit lookin' at me like that!
How long were you married?
Well no, but... Jeanne, are you happy at home?
Uh-huh. Want one?
Carrots.
I wish you wouldn't talk too much. We let a car get away.
You don't think I'm going around panhandling for you. Best thing in the world for you carrots. Had a tough time getting them. If that farmer ever caught me goodnight!
Oh, they'll stop, all right. It's a matter of knowing how to hail them.
You know, Rona, we weren't all that good together even when we were good together.
What?
I don't know.
I thought he'd never leave.
Everybody's got to be somewhere.
It would have been really embarrassing!
Meet again, sometime.
I hope we will, too.
I did like it. All I said was, "It's not 'King Kong'."
First she loved him, then she didn't, then no one else could have him...
Thank you, thank you, thank you! I'll do that for you some time. That's very sweet. Say listen, what did you say your name was?
Your valet, sir.
You're my what?
I'm your valet, sir. Dawson is the name, sir.
Who are you?
I like my bath all right. How do you like your bath?
How do you like your bath, sir?
Madame, it is that kind of approach which has made Paris what it is.
Here... here we are... here you are and here I am... feel it?
Bad manners to point with your own... Here... the Eiffel Tower.
I don't have to but I find it natural.
I know where to look.
Lombard... It will take a few days for the things I need to get here. Meanwhile I d sooner not draw police attention walking the streets like a hungry dog...
I thought you d never ask... As I was having my coffee and crescents at the Mondrian the other morning I spotted your photograph in the Los Angeles Times... There s a tough lady, I thought. Just the kind who might help me...
Look, you said you weren't feeling great. I thought you should rest.
Yes I did- I sat across from her in a mall. We ate together. We ate, that's eating, sharing an important physical event.
Well, I wouldn't call them nincom --
Hi, Charlie.
I am impressed. We used the distinctive cover as a sort of mental flash card.
Yes.
Pleased to meet you.
No, Rachel...
Do you know why I'm here?
No, just stand there... lemme look at you a minute.
Do you know who I am?
You left me to die, friend.
Is this what's left of your army?
Sam?
No. Please, Monsieur, it is a little game we play. They put it on the bill, I tear the bill up. It is very convenient.
No, Captain, please.
I was informed you were the most beautiful woman ever to visit Casablanca. That was a gross understatement.
Not everybody's supposed to have a family.
I embrace Mystery. I don't know what's coming. And I don't mind.
No.
No, I think I need everyone! I love people. I want to meet them all! I just think there are too many out there saying "This is mine." or "She's mine." Too many lines have been drawn. World's breaking apart because of man's weakness for some testosterone conquests over territory and power and people. He wants control over what deep down he knows he has no control over whatsoever and it scares him silly.
And what a way to quit. While you're still champion! That's the way to leave, Hildy!
I'm also a criminal and a hotel thief.
And then, in the war, to kill and hide. That's all.
I'm a gambler -- I'm running at large like a happy pig, devouring anything of life that pleases me, I really belong in jail
Really, I haven't a bit of character. None at all.
When I was a little boy I was taught to ride and be a gentleman -- at school, it was a monastery, I learned to pray and lie -- and ---
I'm gonna drive us to Liverpool.
Summers are short here, Annie. There isn't much of a fall. Before you know it, the roads are closed... the nights get long.
Two people can't just be alone together in the world. At least not us...
Talent is no holy shield. Von Richtofen was killed by a farm boy. Instincts are not enough. Do it our way. We've worked these things out. The good pilots can become better and the great ones can learn how to stay alive. Why do you have to do everything the hard way?
Sure.
Plenty of time.
I don't know. Extra apartment keys. What's it matter?
What about after?
Hello? Yeah, she is. Just a minute. For you.
I...ahhh...umm...I'm thirsty.
So you had to be your own lifeline.
How in the devil did you do the Rembrandt then?
You were afraid of heights?
Aren't we all.
That book's really not good -- just in case, you know, browsing turned to buying. You'd be wasting your money.
I think the man who wrote it has actually been to Turkey, which helps. There's also a very amusing incident with a kebab.
Fine.
I love. I kill.
Shoulda brought my gun.
He's falling for her. Look at him.
He using her.
But it s twenty degrees outside...
So.
I don't wanna go.
Don't tell me your ticket was in it?
Well of all the well Maybe you'll be interested to know your bag's gone.
Yeah. I knew you'd catch on eventually.
That cadaverous-looking yegg who sat in front of us, just up and took it. Boy, how that baby can run!
Well, then, I'm glad I remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.
I don't know. I guess so.
Do you want to sit there, Jeff?
Did I do something wrong, Mr. Hand?
I'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, Jeff.
Hey, it's in my locker, Mr. Hand.
Now, Mr. Spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. Now I have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. Tonight, you and I are going to talk in great detail about the Davis Agreement, all the associated treaties, and the American Revolution in particular. Now if you can just turn to Chapter 47 of Lord of Truth And Liberty.
Fine. You sit right here on your bed. I'll use the chair here. As I explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year -- I don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. I'd rather be preparing the lesson.
Your sister is an unbelievable cook.
Sully, it's Healy. What's going on over there?
Don't cry, Mollie, there's nothing to cry about.
Down the drainpipe. I didn't mean to shoot him. You believe me, don't you, Mollie?
Let 'em take me. It's better that way.
Well, that explains it. Anyone could develop an obsession for the past, with a background like that.
It's not so bad.
Something like that.
You should look like you dressed yourself.
And I'm supposed to respect your fashion tips, because you're what, a New Yorker?
I should look different.
Well, then, I'll take it up with her.
Well, I'm close to her. I wanted to meet the one that got away.
What?
Why is she bringing that bag?
I love you, Miss Kubelik.
Did you hear what I said, Miss Kubelik? I absolutely adore you.
What about Mr. Sheldrake?
In there.
And when she goes to those places...
You don't know me. Not when it comes to shit like this. I have to do this. I need for you to know you can count on me to protect you. Now write down the address.
What do you mean?
Lydia, I went to this great house tonight, this guy designed and built, you would have loved it.
You bet I did.
Yes! But don't hold that against me. I'm a little screwy myself.
Uh...Where...where do you want to go?
Finished or unfinished?
Must be some strange power Westley has over you women. How do you expect to get there?
I didn't give him anything . You were the big-hearted gal. How about wiring your father now?
Not a sou. I had some before the fainting scene.
It takes money to buy food.
Yeah.
Come on, we're going to get your coat.
You can stay tonight.
I have brought you trouble. Maybe I should have come alone.
Good night.
Of course. They go. Yes. Yes.
I understand. I'm so sorry
Good-morrow, cousin.
Is the day so young?
Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create. heavy lightness. Serious vanity. Misshapen chaos of well seeming forms.
But new struck cuz.
Ay me! Sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast?
What're you talking about? You're a real likeable person. You'll make friends out there in Portchester one, two, three. You'll have people visiting you alla time. I'll come visit you. I'll borrow my brother Freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or I'll call you up. And it's gonna be nice. Don't be so afraid.
Hello, Ralph.
It's no big deal, she just gave you the wrong keys that's s...
I... How long have I been here?
Who's got access to my goddamn file?
And, since it's only two streets away, I suggest we go take a look. Now!
Well, it's like I said, there's a ton of empty buildings around here and most of them were apparently given back to the city, so they're not private.... Now, Jahn here is an drama student at the University. He knows of a building that they were going to turn into a puppet theatre - they even began work on it, until they ran out of money.
It's big, right Jahn?
Don't give me this Kat, I'm doing it for you and your country.
Look, just hear me out, okay?
Yeah.
Coz of something I lost.
'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.
How come you don't like me?
I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
What do I got?
You been in the Majors?
You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
You fucked me, man? Why would you do that?
-- And then?
Why didn't you live together?
This is your house.
Read the papers! Half the country's doing it!
Could you--
You'd do a good job.
Zuzu! What's the matter with Zuzu?
We nev-- We don't name names! We say the Pope.
I'm just resting my feet.
Oh God yes -- I'm sorry.
Yeah. No thanks.
Because it was a lie.
Please...
Okay.
Yeah.
Let's go down and find her -- I need a drink -- Come along Zinnowitz. I don't know anything about women -- been married for twenty-six years.
Bluff does it, Preysing, bluff does it. Goodnight.
Barman -- whiskey -- For you, Mr. Kringelein?
For me? -- Oh, please, something sweet and cold.
I never read that. That was-that was Henry James, right? Novel, uh, the sequel to Turn of the Screw? My Sexual...
What I wouldn't give for a large sock o' horse manure.
I-I-I mean, I'm comparatively normal for a guy raised in Brooklyn.
I wanta throw the heater to announce my presence with authority.
I see.
In a concentration camp, one is apt to lose a little weight.
As you see, it was true every single time. Thank heaven I found you, Berger. I am looking for a man by the name of Ugarte. He is supposed to help me.
We're doing our best, sir.
We're working on it.
Trying to put it off on her?
How are we going to get out there?
Somewhere's where they might go out and leave the safe open?
Yes?
Let him try to make some money! That's part of "seeing the world," isn't it?
Will you marry me?
You worked here?
"To announce your fucking presence with authority"? This guy's a first ball fastball hitter. He's looking for heat.
If there are, we'll all be dead.
Me? He can't. I'm already disturbed.
How much did you pay?
They don't see foreign women in this market. How much did you pay?
Which stall?
You've been cheated, don't worry, we'll take it back.
Just dinner and dance, right?
When? When I'm asleep?
Well, I don't know where to begin. There's been so many things said about me that I
An O-filler. You fill in all the spaces in the O's, with your pencil. I was watching you.
How the hell I'm supposed to know the damn difference?
I said a masked ball, not a costume party.
Let's mingle a little, shall we?
We're working.
Popup, on floorboards. And--
Hi.
I brought these, but clearly...
Sorry about not ringing back. The whole two-names concept was totally too much for my flatman's pea-sized intellect.
Yeah?
Fuck you! If I'm gonna kill myself I'll do it when I'm good and ready! You can go to hell!
Hey, you can't kick me! You're an apparition!
Gaston Monescu.
You're perfect for me, too.
Ha-ha!
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me.
You send telegrams here?
I never thought of that.
What for?
That's right. You didn't.
Take my advice grab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony.
I think maybe, we're both so used to operating at this level that -- How can one person be unhappy? If one person is unhappy, both have to be... by definition.
I'm having luck for the first time in my life.
All of that at once, Baron?
I take five hundred.
I do drink, Baron -- I drink to you, Baron and to win. It's good, -- come along, Baron.
Hey!
I want to enjoy my little time left with you.
I'm done, Clem. I'm just going to ride it out. Hiding is clearly not working.
Yeah.
Sure thing. Look, I've got enough, between your preliminary statements and all the witness accounts. You can go home. Gimme til morning. Find out who he is. Until then, don't sweat it, huh? Just your random bad cheese trying to hole you.
I always think of him on New Year's. How he used to pour us each half a can of beer. Remember?
You always threw up.
Yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. He loved that about you.
He was just having fun.
It was like you'd passed some test, you know?
It was just a can of beer, Frank.
Yeah, but he told you things. He never told me anything. Even though I was the oldest. It was always you two, running off, doing things together.
You could've come.
I could've. But he didn't want me to.
You're making things up, Frank.
Last year? It can't be that long.
No..no, it's..I don't know what to say. This is so nice of you...Jack...
Can I take you to lunch?
You were following us?
It's no secret that you loved her.
Yeah. I'll go check on your boy.
He asked for a loan of it, didn't he?
Vada.
Come on, Bill, don't talk to me about how much money's involved. It's my money.
You said it, mister. I gotta go.
Hey, love will make you do fucked-up things.
The bottom line is, I'm not going to use my philanthropy as some form of currency... especially after what I did. I lied to this poor girl. Lied, man. She deserved better.
Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
'From the desk of Waring Hudsucker. To. Sidney J. Mussburger. Regarding. My demise. Dear Sid. By the time you read this, I will have joined the organization upstairs -- an exciting new beginning. I will retain fond memories of the many years you and I -- '
Binoculars. He had these Binoculars he has kept from the war.
Binoculars.
"I have these uh..." She explains to you... "When I was a little girl my father had these beautiful old glasses." Like... I don't know the word. Like for watching uh... for watching the birds.
What was that?
Tell me.
Oh nothing.
Henry, I've been working my tail off on this. Look, all I need is a little cash to loosen up some tongues and you've got the scoop. It'll send those scum-bags down for life; be a big feather in the cap for the Bugler and your board of directors back home!
You can hold back this months pay-check until I come through with the story.
Deal!
Two hundred dollars, make it six thousand crowns?
What for?
Believe me, there's nothing to be afraid of.
That's a Texas bubble gum machine on your back porch.
It's an unusual trade.
Where's your husband?
She says you're a fabulous hairdresser.
Thank you.
Felicia says you're a very good hairdresser.
Well, yeah.
Mh-hm.
It was a dream, you're awake, you're all right, now. Can you tell me?
Yes, a bracelet's been lost, but I'm still on my vacation.
Hello, Inspector--I hear your vacation's been spoiled. Somebody lost a bracelet.
Hello, young fellow!
Nooooo!--going to catch up on my reading. I'll take this one.
Coming to the pool for a swim?
I understand you searched Brett for it last night. By the way--what do you know about him?
Go right over there.
It's not his job -- It's my job!
Was he a senator? Is he on the Trilateral Commission? Was he in Who's Who In Washington NINE YEARS Reed wrestles him away from the door, as Bob struggles to get free. I'll destroy him, Alan. I'll shred the bastard!!!
Bob...
I'll lock him away for good.
Don't do this.
What do you mean by that?
Then we'll all go to jail together.
Are you threatening me?
Just what you think I mean.
I know. But I'm the only father you've got.
He doesn't care. But thanks anyway.
Quince, m'man, thanks for the offer, but it's all set for just me and Bill. More people might --
I know. Gum up the works.
I'll have me some of that punch there, too.
No. I'm new in town.
Yeah. On the section gang.
You work around town?
Went to college, huh?
Oh my God.
Anybody else would have left you by now, but I'm sticking with you. I said I would. And if I got to ride your ass like Zorro, you're gonna show me the money.
Another drink please.
Man, I got a shelf life of ten years, tops! My next contract's gotta bring me the dollars that'11 last me and mine a very long time. I'm out of this sport in five years. What's my family gonna live on? What you get me. So I don't want to hear about ya shit, your "nya nya nya."
Why not?
You are not allowed to act this way.
It's a quality that might come in handy for a commercial sometime. 69.
The least you could do is nod and act sympathetic --
Well, boo-fucking-hoo.
Why don't you ride anymore? Grace told me you used to ride when she was younger.
It's all right. He's young. Just hold out your hand a little lower so he can get the smell of you.
Just polite. Well, maybe you'd like to try riding again, some time before you go home.
Let's just see how the two of us make out first, huh?
Here. Been an interestin' evening.
Twelve thousand.
Would you get off my back, Sarah? Once and for all, will you get out, will you GET OFF MY BACK?!
Shut up.
How much do I owe you?
Cash.
Will you take a check, Bert?
Felicia's really interested in the shop, isn't she?
Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question.
Do you miss Mallory?
What I did for fun for starters. Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun... No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else.
What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters.
Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun?
Aside from the obvious?
So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun.
Slate it.
The pus that infects the mucous that cruds up the fungus.
Yeah.
Ninotchka, you're jealous.
You can't bluff me, Burns. I don't care who you are or what paper you're editor of.
We want to see you.
Who do you think you are, breaking in here like this?
Hold her, boys!
Just a minute, Johnson!
How?
Okay...that would be cool sometime. How 'bout tomorrow?
I suppose that would be okay.
There's nothing wrong with me!
You're as bad as the rest of them, Elaine! It's all here in the design specifications! Look! It's all here!
Freezing. Maybe a couple degrees over.
Yes. I think that's very fair.
.....What are you doing?
Don't you think it's time to go now? Running around here during the day is one thing but at night we could be killed by a wide variety of people.
Well that's stupid. This is my park just as much as it is theirs. You think it's fair they keep us out just because they make us think we'll get killed or something?
It's a classic.
Right now?
If you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?
But, Mary--everybody's having such a great time-- why spoil it?
But it's not.
What are you doing?
Well look -- I was kind of upset there. I'm sorry I said those things.
Well two minutes ago you told me I wasn't good enough for your daughter. Now you say you're sorry I got that impression.
You wouldn't.
It must of been a convincing letter.
What! What about the group and my singing career? What about me?
What are you talking about? Who's Janet?
You don't know zip! You think I'm going to end up selling appliances like my father? Chasing women around the store. I've got to give it a shot. Why are you trying to kill the two things that mean the most to me? Until yesterday you loved me and you loved us. What the hell has changed? For two years I've done nothing but love you. I'll show you, I'm going to be just like Fabian!
Jos, you've been to college, you're successful, you wash your hair now-- you're not Josie Grossie anymore.
If she wants me, she can come to me.
Yeah, I been there.
Okay.
That's what he told you, huh?
Gee, boy, what do you have? You have plague?
... What's your name again?
That's blackmail.
It isn't lit yet.
Listen we're not supposed to piss either but that doesn't stop you from carrying "it" on board?!
You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional.
You can't prove anything.
Did our marriage ever mean anything to you?
Meaning my house.
I mean it really bothers me when people try to pigeonhole me like that.
Oh sure. I know what people think. It's like, Oz, he's just this kickass lacrosse player -- I also play football, by the way -- But that's like...not all that I am.
I just -- realized that I didn't know anything about you. I was interested.
Yeah...so like, what else do you do?
I was being selfish. And majorly insensitive. And I'm a total idiot.
Beg me!
Beg me again!
You're a cocksucker!
We've still a few lone incurables. Prone to violence, to perversion.
I'll come over when I'm ready.
What else?
There's a name on the gravestone.
Where?
No alcohol?
I wanted this to be a date.
Okay -- up there.
We're going somewhere. After. And no. I didn't ask your father.
Your turn.
The view had better be worth it.
I know you want to.
I'll give you a chance, Dyle -- which is more than you'd give me. Where's the money?
Very pretty. Now what?
Miss Price! Miss Price, please!
Get your fucking hands off me! What the hell is going on here?
How long have I been here?
I'm going to the Show.
Then go.
Mmm, what?
I want to marry you. I want to take care of you and I want your children, and I want you to be my girl. That's all I want. That's all I want out of my life, and it's a lot.
No --
It's loaded with what?
Well, he ain't mine, so skip it.
Horses with horns! Huh! Do we have 'em in Nevada?
What do they look like?
Then if they wasn't alive, how can they be an animal?...
An' if you can't hunt 'em and even if you could they'd be tough, what's the use of knowin' how to spell them?
Oh shit. You said "boss."
Who were you talking to?
My secretary saw you with that boy.
Then you were talking to him.
Now I feel like Clarence Thomas.
Get in... hurry up, it's almost full.
Your husband told me you were beautiful, but I was unprepared.
Isn't everything?
She hates you with the fire of a thousand suns . That's a direct quote
I don't know, Dorsey. ..the limo.-the flowers. Another hundred for the tux --
Where?
She kissed me.
Enough with the Barbie n' Ken shit. I know.
Fine Lloyd.
I see the bus is in. I'll take my shipment with me.
No hurry. I'll have it sent over. Have a drink with me.
Look, look, man. I think the man is heartbroken.
Jim!
Happy for us.
Thanks.
It's all going to work.
Everybody! Crunch and Goon and everybody! I think they're going to kill you.
It's all going to work. We're going to save the world.
Yeah?
I have to go, Bill -- it's been a helluva day. Need a few minutes to sort everything out.
Sure.
Are we...?
Does it have a name?
What happened when you were twelve?
Yeah. Honey?
Aaaahhhh, the portal!
Shut up! Sorry, dear, I lost control for a minute.
Sir, let those laugh that win.
I hope that you are not thinking of leaving us soon, knight?
Well, if my intentions are what you think they are -- if I do wish to step into your shoes, what then? I have no other intentions than you had yourself. Lady Cosgrove's wealth may be great, but am I not of a generous nature enough to use it worthily? Her rank is lofty, but not so lofty as my ambition. I will be sworn to muster just as much regard for my Lady Cosgrove as you ever showed her; and if I win her, and wear her when you are dead and gone, corbleu, knight, do you think that it will be the fear of your ghost will deter me?
I got a question. If you guys know so much about women, how come you're here at like the Gas 'n' sip on a Saturday night completely alone, drinking beers, no women anywhere?
It's a potent aphrodisiac, isn't it? Power over another man.
Is he your boyfriend?
Do you know where you're going?
Tell your friends.
In these woods you are a commoner. Now be quiet. True royalty approaches.
Shhh!
Couldn't get the words out before.
Better get him to a hospital.
Didn't I tell you to beat it - huh?
Got a thick feelin' here.
Anything you say, baby.
Okay, Santa Claus. 2000 lunches.
Cobb! Get lunch for the rest of them.
You're a genius, Babe - a genius!
Good! Good! Stay there. Don't show your face down here. I'll tell everybody you're on your vacation. They'll never know where the stories are coming from. Stick close to him, Babe - you can get an exclusive story out of him every day for a month. We'll have the other papers crazy. Babe, I could kiss you!
Marvelous! "At two o'clock this morning, Mr. Deeds tied up traffic while he fed a bagful of doughnuts to a horse. When asked why he was doing it, he replied: 'I just wanted to see how many doughnuts this horse would eat before he'd ask for a cup of coffee.'" Beautiful! What happened after that?
When're you going to see him again?
Okay.
We're getting out of the ground today.
I can use your mom's.
Sure.
Thank you.
Like you'd know.
Ambitious.
No problem --
Well, she's... she's real pretty and ... and she's got a cute shape... she's a good sport, ya know, for laughs and ... she loves fried chicken wings and beer.
So... alright. What terrible sin have you committed since then that can't wait till tomorrow to be forgiven?
You crazy, come up here? It's fuckin one degree outside.
We have no Juliet!
I have work, I can't leave.
Who are you?
I don't know.
Hi.
Yes I do.
Yeah I can't.
Do you know it?
Hi, I'm-I'm Tony Lacey.
Uh, we just wanted to stop by and say that we really enjoyed your sets.
I though it was... very musical, and I liked it a lot.
Are you... are you recording? Or do- Are you with any label now?
Uh, well, I'd like to talk to you about that sometime, if you get a chance.
Come on.
She told me she killed them.
Yes... you run this hotel.
Would you tell me, who has the room on the second floor in the corner, that corner?
What is her name?
Oh, let it ring.
What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56.
... That's funny... I had this job with Enzo... we got fired too.
Come on-- I'll promote a card game, and we'll be sitting pretty.
Not a chance.
Is that a nice way to talk to a pal?
Don't let money spoil a beautiful friendship. Look at these here telegrams to be delivered! This ain't a job-- it's a marathon.
I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
I don't know.
I know how you feel, Miss Kubelik. You think it's the end of the world -- but it's not, really. I went through exactly the same thing myself.
I loved you on this day. I love this memory. The rain. Us just hanging.
With who?
A what?
I guess so.
You can't leave yet. The doctor says it takes forty-eight hours to get the stuff out of your system.
I wouldn't say that -- What would you like to have for diner? There's onion soup and canned asparagus --
I've checked the records of Jane McKenna's death -- I can't get anything special. But Frank Ligourin had another girl you said, besides McKenna and you.
She's been leaving messages here too.
Oh, boy.
You should call her.
Yeah. Okay.
Oooh, I see. Didn't go so good last night, huh? That's a shocker. You mean getting drunk and calling Victoria didn't put you in the mood? You dumb fuck. Your divorce pain's getting real old real fast, dude.
Count me out.
Yeah, well, maybe you should check your messages first.
Later.
Right now.
I will. See ya!
What?
And you were a lamb. As soft as milk.
Her chaperone. My lady's country cousin. My, but you be a handsome gallant, just as she said! You may call me Miss Wilhelmina!
That would be inconceivable.
Making sure nobody's following us.
You're sure nobody's following us?
Stop doing that. We can all relax, it's almost over-
No reason. It's only, I just happened to look behind us, and something is there.
As I told you, it would be absolutely, totally, and in all other ways, inconceivable. No one in Guilder knows what we've done. And no one in Florin could have gotten here so fast. Out of curiosity, why do you ask?
Yeah, Eddie was a real character. Had these girls cooked the rocks he called the Rockettes.
You never wanted to go out with 'me, did you?
I understand your impatience, but if you want this trial to be acknowledged as legal we must follow correct procedure and...
But if this trial seems fixed, I fear you'll have the very opposite result to the one you want...
Heard on the radio how doctors is usin' leeches again, just in old times. You know, when even barbers used 'em?
Yeah, well listen to this... Radio said back in the 1920s a I-talian doctor figured out that if, say, a fella got his nose cut off or bit off in, say, a barfight or somethin', they'd sew one of his forearms to his nose for a few weeks... Then put leeches on it.
How they used to do it. Course they got more sophisticated ways now. Radio said the Chinese, I think it is, figured a better idea is by insertin' a balloon in the forehead and lettin' it hang down on the nose.
Honest, Lula. I prob'ly ain't precisely got all the facts straight, but it's about what they said.
We're about dry bones, sweetheart. We don't wanna have to push this "bird" into New Orleans.
He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
Yes, well unfortunately I can't just switch the "on" button to "off." The sad fact of the matter is that you've unintentionally rubbed off on me.
I said I was sorry.
I wish I could say the same for myself. I was up thinking about you all night.
Oh right, last night. I guess I owe you an apology.
Wait, wait. You told her about me?
Of course he thinks he can beat me, Bert. He wouldn't be playing me if he didn't. Right, Felson?
Oh, about five hundred.
How much?
Oh, Thomas! She has cut my strings! I am unmanned, unmended, and unmade, like a puppet in a box.
"It's beneath her..." She's a mother fucking housewife... nothing's beneath her!
Level with me, Eddie. You ever play billiards before?
I don't know.
To marry you.
She's someone I just can't -- someone who... self-evidently can't be mine -- and it's as if I've taken love-heroin -- and now I can't even have it again. I've opened Pandora's box. And there's trouble inside.
Jeanne -- if we were to ask forgiveness all the time, we'd spend our whole life in church.
What?
What the hell is wrong with you?
I don't know. I never used a gun.
Really?
You'd be surprised what all you can get, you ask for it the right way.
You're the reason, Jack, I don't keep all my money in banks.
No? Where do you keep it, Dick? I'm talking about all those uncut diamonds you told Glenn about.
I know what you're talking about.
Is she going through with it?
Say, that's old Prissy Bensinger's desk.
Can you check again?
Can there be some mistake?
Which one you talkin' about now, son? We know ole Hazel did it; we know young Roxy did it -- and the other one Well, hell, she's got that magna come lawdy pussy on her that done fried up your brain.
I'm not sure anymore she did it.
Did you check all four years?
Two-thirty. Shhh...
What are you going you doing?
The belt I'm looking for was from my grandmother.
If you want.
Elaine -- right now I don't feel like talking much. I'm sorry about everything but I think I'll just do this now.
Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
Why not go to work for me?
Fast and loose, man.
Selling all my baseball cards. And helping me buy enough food and supplies to fill several large trucks.
Why does it never work out? You and...men?
...Okay.
Well, they're not starving yet, but they need help.
The world is fantastic. It's the ultimate absurd circus. I am shot from a cannon into the energy.
No...it was me. And I'm sorry mom, really, ju...just tell me what to do, I'll do anything.
Why?
MOM!
Nothing lasts.
Apparently, yeah. I was supposed to leave last night with the lady marshal, but for some reason she wanted to wait.
Sure they are.
Other than we had so much fun the last time we worked together. You gonna tell me why you're comin' to me instead of the FBI?
I don't know. He's not on the map.
Ah, that's the new German 77. And judging by the sound, only about thirty-five miles away.
And getting closer every minute. Here. Drink up. We'll never finish the other three.
Oh, Vada...
Pause as he takes all this in I think your Dad would miss you.
Okay, okay we don't have to talk about him, Vada, Vada we don't have to talk about him, it's okay. We won't talk about him all right?
Come here, sit down over here.
Explain to me again why we didn't do this in Des Moines in an air conditioned office?
Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
Shhh! Shhh!
Darling, darling... please!
Now, Ninotchka... please!
But, darling, you can't do that.
The first time I've been grateful for Coit Tower.
I have to talk to you in a second about that, Lance, ok?
We just talked.
Marty, let's go downna Seventy-Second Street area tonight.
I don't feel like going, Angie. I thought I'd take this girl to a movie.
Hey.
You having fun?
You got me mad, that's why. Hey, Joe, show Marty that picture.
-- the kwan.
Maybe you don't. Because it's not just the money I deserve. It's not just the "coin." It's the...
College. In Illinois. She was playing the cello. I hadn't heard cello music growing up. She had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. When she played, it was...
You know, I'm not in homicide any more.
Would you like some coffee?
Can we just ignore it?
Can we just forget it?
Thank you, Sera.
Please!
No... we already talked about that.
What do you do?
No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated.
Yes.
I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco.
Mother, where did you go to law school?
I know, Mother.
Uhh, Miss devoto...
I think it's still available.
The only thing my father digs is cold, green money. All my mother cares about is her standing at the country club.
No, really, it's your plan, you should get at least 30 per cent--
Come on, what can you do with six billion you can't do with four?
It's fifty-fifty, less the cost of the dress.
You mean Nuke. You said "Crash".
Hey! What're you guys doing here-- stealing my girl?
Now, Nuke, would I do a thing like that? Hey kids, this is the great Ebby Calvin "Nuke" LaLoosh.
Sarah Packard... Bert Gordon.
He's bringing a girl?
Yes.
Uh-huh.
Not very late.
20,000?! But... I heard King Charles was... financially embarrassed.
I can't win with you.
It looks stupid. It's a pinky ring. It's a man's ring.
That don't sound like Johnny. Where's the ring?
But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
Enough to scare me that you wouldn't get here in time, and we'd lose him.
You think he's getting out of here?
Everything he owns is laid out on the bedroom, ready for packing.
He did?
Nobody likes garbage -- Anyway, this girl with the dirty mouth wasn't bad lookin', but the guys wouldn't take her out for any serious datin'.
Everything is temporary. That don't excuse nothing.
I guess we get what we pay for, huh?
I'm gonna put a dead bolt on your front door, too. This isn't exactly the safest neighborhood in the world, you know.
He's got a reputation for doing all his --
Sixty-nine. We've got good answers to all of 'em.
Reasons PG E thinks it shouldn't go to --
Corey.
No -- you're right.
I'll talk to you in the morning.
And you get on very well.
Yes.
And she's in your house.
Yes.
Right. Right. You think it's the wrong moment. Fair enough. Do you mind if I have a go?
Spike!
Well, isn't this perhaps a good opportunity to... slip her one?
No.
It's something I do...
Seriously, when I left, I joined the Army and took the service exam. They found my psych results fit a certain profile. A certain "Moral flexibility" would be the best way to describe it... I was loaned out to a CIA- sponsored program. It's called "mechanical operations." We sort of found each other...
I was, but no... yes... I was before, but now I'm not. It's irrelevant, really. The idea of governments, nations, it's mostly a public relations theory at this point, anyway. But I'll tell you something, until about five months ago, I really enjoyed my work.
When we get here.
Good evening, Mr. Pimenov.
How's the beautiful lady?
Certainly -- always when Grusinskaya dances.
I thought she was splendid!
How about tonight?
Doing what?
Tell me what to do, Annette. How can I win your heart. I'll do anything. I can't get you out of my mind.
Yes.
What did you tell him about the baby?
And you turned him down??
You little bitch! How could you? Was there ever a baby, Lynette? That's all I want to know! Did you make up that baby, Lynette? Did you??
Who?
It's really important.
Everything I did, I did for you. I love you, Peter. Think of it. I'm giving you a gift, absolute power and knowledge.
You lied to me my whole life. Everything you said, everything you did.
You are my son. Don't you see the opportunity that lies before you?
You raised me, like a son.
I had to. There was no other way. Their deaths were part of the greatest legacy I could have given you.
You killed my parents.
The door's locked.
... dick?
Adolph J. Giron.
I want to see--
I am.
Aye, ma'am.
I'm glad of it.
She's well, too.
That doesn't leave much time for dilly dallying.
Screaming isn't all right. Not in my house it isn't.
Cynthia's not coming?
We are...for the tools.
So you're testing me now?
So the Mask is part of the down payment too. Must be a really big job.
Try laps. Say a hundred.
I'm really pretty busy...
Did you go home and get it?
Mark. What happened to your date?
It was like she was trying to push me as far as she could. She called it opening new doors.
Objection. The witness has already stated that Miss Lawson left without an explanation.
The opinion of a scorned lover is hardly an objective view.
It was like sex was a game to her. She got off on the control. She always used to tell me it had to be her way.
What?
Look!
That tuba player!
Have a drink?
Will you have a cigar?
No, thanks.
Are you all set?
So when you hear the smoking sign go 'ding', you know everything's going to be okay.
Unless you want the right.
Super cool. This is great stuff. How ya doin'?
Okay, good, this is all very noble.
Thank you.
No. I call it like I see it. I'm a journalist. I'm a truth teller.
Probably met by answering an ad in the New York Review of Books. "Thirtyish academic wishes to meet woman who's interested in Mozart, James Joyce and sodomy." Whatta you mean, our sexual problem?
Ok.
They don't get opened until eight.
You're crazy. Those girls love me.
Kyra, this is Monica. She, uh...
No.
It's okay.
Yeah. Come on we're stopping here for the night.
Take that mush out of your mouth!
What did you do with her?
You been in a fight?
Is she injured?
No, sir...
That would be Lieutenant Garber, and he's very busy upstairs...
Come, sweetheart. Let me put it on you. You will teach these jewels. For the first time they will learn how they can look.
Now, darling, don't get impatient, wait until we are married. You know that worthless butler of mine... that reactionary? Some day when I come home to you I may say, "Darling, I drove Gaston to the market and look what I got from him!"
Who cried that one?
...but big.
'Joe Black'. Won fifteen and lost two for the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1952.
-- Black.
What do you mean?
Yes.
Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
Now she tells me.
Hi Ray.
Yeah, look at that sweet face. You'd never guess he killed nine people. I'm gonna get my smokes. Be right back.
Seems George isn't making too many friends in lockup.
How are the lessons going? ADA nods enthusiastically. He's getting on all right? ADA nods again Good.
Hmm... let's see... no, there's something missing.
Good afternoon, Mr. Harris.
Afternoon.
Goodbye, Bill.
I don't want you to get too excited... these are on loan... however...
It can't be true!
How'd you get in here?
You got goddamn tweety-birds flutterin' around your head, that's what you got. You think you're gonna fuck like minks, raise rugrats, and live happily ever after? Oh, man.
I know what happened. Catherine told me what happened.
Goddamn writers -- all they do is use up trees and ruin people's eyes. There's gotta be somebody at Berkeley who knows what the hell happened.
She's a writer -- it's part of what she does.
She'd have to be nuttier than a twenty-pound Christmas fruitcake. She's not the one who hangs out with multiple murderers -- your girlfriend is.
He was I.A. He probably asked her about it.
How did she know Nilsen knew about it -- if it happened?
Don't you get it, Gus? If Beth killed Johnny Boz to frame Catherine -- she wouldn't want anyone to know what happened at Berkeley. It gives her the motive to kill Nilsen.
If she's telling you the truth.
For a time.
Meaning?
So what!? His job is to hand out the paychecks. And he does that very well, let me tell you.
The brothers in Leavenworth gave me the name.
Come on -- relax -- Give them a drink.
Get away from that door.
I'll get the drinks, but not here. Let's split. I can't stand this any more, it's murdering my respect for literature.
You guys having a go a me or what?
Well, this place is too expensive so you've had it.
A criminal?
I am not a dream.
It did.
I can't believe we just had our senior prom.
Vicky...last night...I wasn't lying.
Don't say that, we can do it somehow. It might not be perfect, but --
What?
Man, I rearranged his face with that right -- The people love what's happenin' tonight.
Are you really going to meet them?
Who knows. Plato?
What?
Like a union?
You did good, Massey!
What's a chickie-run?
Can't it wait?
I'm always open to learning new things.
And I suppose you're going to show me how to relax?
Smythe, what do you do with yourself - I mean, when you're not carrying those double-strength - what do you do with yourself?
Broomsticks instead of tail guns.
Home of the Brave.
She said "penetrate." Heh heh heh.
What?
Horses.
Hey Jack, you re all flush. I guess that seventy-one took a lot outta you.
I just saw Evelyn Thompson.
She is relentless.
She wants to have an affair with me.
She said that?
Pretty much.
Oh yeah... What is it about you?
You're like malaria. Once you get it, you can't get rid of it.
Okay. Good afternoon. Goodbye.
I haven't been back in over twenty years, but I wouldn't be surprised. The population's larger.
Not her mouth... I've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. I've seen it painted on the horizon.
What's wrong with you?
Hallelujah.
Does Sonny kick ass or does Sonny kick ass?
Really? Well, I uhhh...
Your daddy played. I asked, down at the Japanese Community Center. You smoke cigars?
I think you like learning.
Johnson, I'm going to the bottom of this. What do you know about Williams? Are you going to talk or aren't you?
You see, he'd been very clever. Everybody, even our astute friend Guild, thought that Wynant was alive and that he was the murderer. But our hero had just one weak link in his chain. The telegrams, wires and telephones were all very well - but no one had seen Wynant. So he picked on poor Mimi here to strengthen his case. Mimi is the only one at the table who can tell us who the real murderer is. Mimi, who was it that told you to say you'd seen Wynant?
His plan was still working beautifully. Wynant was established as being in town. The watch chain was handed over.... ...with a slight delay...to the police. The only hitch was a man named Nunheim who had found out something. Our hero paid Nunheim once to keep his mouth shut, and when Nunheim threatened him again, he bumped him off.
Shut up.
I don't know.
Yes?
It can wait. Anything else?
There are important papers from --
That can wait till the weekend.
She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires.
Well, bygones're bygones, I always say.
Then they didn't know. And if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. And punitive damages is where the money is.
No! In Vidalia! Farm Route 17!
Show me the document that proves that.
I would now.
Jerry Maguire. SMI.
How's your new book?
To see if I can get away with it.
I'll risk it.
No.
Right.
It's a death mask. Death mask means dead.
Black of course.
That's it, I sure as hell ain't no personal shopper.
I need you to get one more thing for me. A dress, elegant but sexy, something Grace Kelly would wear. Maybe a Balenciaga.
Because I never assume anything.
I guess so. Follow me.
Me too. That's why I like it. It's been a long time since I had a case I cared about.
But knowin' me and you gonna be nigger-rich gives me a whole new outlook. I love airports now. Me 'n' you can get on any one of those planes out there, and go anywhere we ant.
Yeah?
No, sir.
Yes, sir.
Anything I can do back here?
Mr. Gower, do you want something . . . Anything?
Dom Wooganowski. Duh.
You're Woogie?
But but you're married. You have kids a great wife.
Wouldn't this be a great world if insecurity and desperation made us more attractive? If needy were a turn-on?
What's this?
Can I... I brought some --
I know what it is.
Don't start acting hurt.
Mrs. Robinson, you stand there and tell me I'm not good enough for your daughter.
What is it?
No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be let alone.
What makes you think they're even interested? It's only a quarter of a million -- it'll cost more than that to fix up their bookkeeping. As a taxpayer --
What's that? Only -- you're getting too near. I don't trust anybody.
Keep away!
Do you? I mean, are you, are you, are you, are you free this evening?
Okay. Make me an isosceles.
I felt Milholland's report in my pocket. And wondered why I wasn't telling her. Telling someone. What I'd found.
And do you know what I'd like to have you do with that check?
He's losing his teeth.
Recognize these two characters?
In the attic. Behind some of Dad's stuff. Look, Jack can hardly reach the pedals.
Ah! Oh....
I'm sorry she never got her miracle.
Does Alyssa know?
Yes.
You got any weed?
Hi.
And what do you mean barging in here and taking up my valuable time! I've got a company to run here --
Sorry, I thought you were dead.
Finch! Where were you last night? What happened to the foolproof plan?
Vicky, wait.
Ow, what the hell?
I'm such a loser.
Feeling better, Oz?
No... Okay. What I do is watch and wait for, um... You ever watch someone who doesn't know you're watching... an old woman on a bus, kids going to school and you see this flash come over them and you know immediately that it has nothing to do with anything external -- that it's in respond to a private thought they just had? They are just sort of realer and more alive. And when you notice it so are you. If you look at someone long enough, you discover their humanity.
Clippity clop -- clippity clop -- she has to pretend she doesn't hear me. Listening to the story from the upset friend... now she drops off the cappuccino and smiles at the putzette who doesn't even say, "Thank you." No, the putzette wanted the whipped cream so back she goes and now she has to pass him again and it's getting tougher to make believe.
I see the help -- judgement call.
What's wrong with your son, anyway?
I wanna kill the friggin' moron who broke the mirror.
Wonderful psychology. Why don't you say something about my mom? Excuse me.
See, running Coors Beer east of Texas is what bothers me. It makes me a bootlegger.
You know how rumors start.
You're crazy, man. Smart dresser, but crazy.
I can make it to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours... that's no sweat.
I don't see no crowd around you, neither.
I'll carry him 'till the third.
Oh, I'm really glad you called.
We'll see.
They made me put my hat back on.
What about Maxine?
We wish.
I'm still here. Would you like to dance with me, Susan?
If you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.
That's why it's okay.
Well. I'm sorry, sir, but we've got to ask you for it.
Nah. Fuck, you guys are right, I don't know what I'm doing. I mean I'm acting like I've got it all together tonight. But I know Vicky is gonna ask me if I love her. And I don't know what I'm gonna say. So now it's like, maybe I'll just wimp out on the whole thing.
So do I, Kev.
I still think you're okay.
Kevin, come on, the bus to Stifler's is gonna be here soon.
I'm not going.
YOU DID.
And by the way, Sherman didn't even get laid.
He didn't?
I must say I found it rather appalling.
I read your teen beat manifesto.
Oh really?
Most people are morons. I mean who are you to knock what you've never experienced?
How do you know I've been with several women?
I told him.
Then it's a good thing.
Everything under control?
Just make yourself comfortable.
Ha, ha... all right, well, uh I guess you can bring out the pasta.
Huh?
Here we come at last, my lord!
Good. Take care of that woman's name for me. And watch your ass.
But I m gettin close, right?
That's it. A great wheel that gives us each what we deserve...
I need to tell you something.
That kind of person would come back as a wildebeest, or a warthog. No, I think it more likely that you were a gazelle, with long, graceful legs, gamboling through the underbrush. Perhaps we met once, a chance encounter in a forest glade. I must have been an antelope or an ibex. What times we must have had -- foraging together for sustenance, picking the grubs and burrs from one another's coats. Or perhaps we simply touched our horns briefly and went our separate ways...
Yes.
"Death and Taxes"?
...Sounds like you're not leaving much room for discussion.
Yes.
Yes.
That's your privilege, Bill. But given our needs, given the absolute necessity for growth, given the fu- ture, the truth is... joining John Bontecou is every bit as certain as - Death and Taxes.
Sorry. I know it looks like I'm reversing my field.
I'm rambling. I really like you. You make me want to talk... I don't know what time it is.
Geez, I'm sorry, buddy --
Now?
Who the fuck do you think you are making up that bullshit about me?!
-- what?
-- where'd you go?
Bogey at three o'clock high! Nose on!
STAY WITH HIM! TIGHTEN YOUR TURN!
You didn't walk out here.
Juliet? You mean Ethel.
You're not afraid, are you?
Yes. Nearly. It's all locked safe in here. We need Ralph for the Pirate King. Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice little part.
It's a lead mine.
Right.
Lead mine.
What?
This place is a gold mine.
Every day. She makes the bed.
Am I... disturbing you?
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.
No, thanks.
I'm gonna die, Nicky. If the gates are broken, no new souls can get in, which means I'll start to deteriorate into nothing.
How bad?
Everything's fine, pop.
Coulda been much worse.
This is bad, Nicky.
Please, pop, just go back to your room.
That's what I came to tell Loretta. There's been a miracle.
Maybe I should go?
Right, I'm just going to keep talking until that ding happens, which is going to be soon.
It would help me if I could kiss you.
You're off, you know? You're way, way off.
Okay. I guess.
What you think, you know, doesn't have much to do with reality. I mean, I hope I'm not the first to say that about you.
Tell him I'm not here.
I think so. And if it comes to it, tell the cops anything you think will make them move. Whatever you came up with couldn t come close to how bad it is. Bye now.
And on a day of mourning. I never met the fellow but once at your house.
What a pleasant hobby.
She'd get along okay. And if she didn't, well, she could take off, just take off, I wouldn't mind... I'd always tell people I deserved it.
You know, before I met her, nobody could ask me how I was doing with my girl. Matter of fact, I didn't really have one.
I wasn't aware there was any law against it.
Listen. I got a lot of respect for her, sir. That's about as good a one as I know to tell you.
Yeah.
What's the matter, Mary?
H'mm--Dear Atlantic--
Put the whole thing in an envelope and mail it through a porthole--
Everyone but me--what do you want now, Mary?
I wanna hear about it.
Yeah, you look tired... Listen, honey. when all this is over, I'm going to sit down and buy you a big, thick steak.
You tired?
Just to keep him out of the sun.
I thought that was Peter Joshua.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Well, not exactly...
Ha ha. You could at least tell me what your first name is these days.
Is there a Mrs. Dyle?
You know, it's very strange -- I have been in the revenge business so long, now that it's over, I don't know what to do with the rest of my life.
I'm here, I've got you...
No.
I think of a man and take away reason and accountability.
Maybe the owners are from Texas.
Remember the Alamo?
What about it?
It's a five-pointed star.
Listen, at least it's warm in here.
Look at that.
Well --
No, I said what did you think.
Rheya --
Oh. No. Not that way. I'd say it was more -- I don't know -- -- too bad? Pathetic?
Yeah, you got to me.
In the movies women are always scratching up guy's back and screaming and stuff. When they're having sex.
I'll hate you forever.
You come from Green Point? Go back to Green Point. You don't work here no more. Here, kid, here's half a bill. Go get your load on.
So tell me why I shouldn't make this place off-limits.
Gimme.
Go to sleep.
You are.
Don t jump any red lights.
This car needs petrol.
Huh, I doubt it... Friedman only deals directly with select customers. I handle the rabble...
Where is Friedman?
Look, I don t think you re fully aware of what you re playing with here, Mister. Whoever put you up to this either pays too well or misinformed you. Why don t you just tell me what it is you want so we can do business in a civilized manner, eh?
Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
Okay.
Seems too coincidental that way.
I like this ring.
Looks, huh?
Yeah, like I was a plate of leftovers -- Somethin' wrong with my face -- Whatta I need, a Caddy to connect with ya sister?
My sister's a friggin' loser.
Hey --
Uncle Terrence, you're...
She's a loser -- She don't enjoy life -- She reads -- Brainy -- Pushin' thirty friggin' years old! She's gonna die alone if she don't wise up.
Fabulous.
I'm sorry for everything.
Just get me out of here as soon as you can.
Oh, great. I'll talk to you later, bye.
How 'bout the key?
Please do not be frightened, Madam.
Get a six-pack of something imported. It's hard to tell you what to get 'cause different places have different things. If they got Fosters, get that, if not, ask the guy at the thing what the strongest imported beer he has. Look, since you're making a beer run, would you mind too terribly if you did a foot run as well. I'm fuckin' starvin' to death. Are you hungry too?
I was looking for you tonight. I don't know if you have a boyfriend...
...or a girlfriend, but if you have some free time... maybe we could have dinner.
No, cuz, I rather weep.
Don't run away.
What?
Have you got a better idea?
Thank you, thank you very much!
I'll see what I can do.
Right here.
Fine. I mean, it's not like I was doubting you, it's just that I know puppetry is a skill that takes a long time to acquire.
Do tell. I love a good plan.
Can you do that? I mean, do you know anything about puppetry?
I was just asking. No disrespect intended.
And you think it's best if I don't come.
In love?
I'm going to miss old Annie. Pop, I think I'll get dressed and go over to Harry's party.
Oh, now, Pop, I couldn't. I couldn't face being cooped up for the rest of my life in a shabby little office.
You see what I mean, don't you, Pop?
Yes.
Hello.
I'd like you to go wait in the car. How's that? Take her with you and put her in back.
In the trunk?
The backseat.
I see better with them on.
You don't take 'em off, I'm gonna throw 'em off the overpass while they're still on your head.
Wait in the car.
You're in civilization now, man, ease up.
Wait a minute. Let me have your raincoat. Somebody forgot to bring me clean clothes.
I brought 'em, they're back at Glades in the Cadillac. You wanted to take her car.
What, are you nuts? That's Oprah talking.
Lotte! Why aren't you at the pet shop?
That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth. All three-day turns.
How long you had this?
All I know is she's beautiful. Lots of soul. Perfect for you. I'm not going to feel good about this trip until you guys hook up. Don't you just want to feel that cozy little box grip down on your Johnson?
-- Yeah... your car down here?
-- Listen, I'm supposed to take Jill to El Cholo tonight. She's really going to be pissed if I don't.
Well, I can't talk though --
Yes, I'll be there.
I'm just working....I have some customers here.....
How you two doin'?
I'm going to take out Diane Court again.
Baloney! Joe! Bring me a special!
We could go to my apartment. You could see how the other half lives.
Thank you. I wanna see you again too. And again, and again, and again. Bama, I know we haven't known each other long, but my parents went together all throughout high school, and they still got a divorce. So, fuck it, you wanna marry me?
You can call me Oz.
-- Thanks, coach --
Hey, what're you doing here?
You can call me Ostreicher.
I'm at a loss, Ninotchka. You must forgive me if I appear a little old- fashioned. After all, I'm just a poor bourgeois.
I'd like to say it a thousand times.
You're the most improbable creature I've ever met in my life, Ninotchka, Ninotchka...
What can I possibly do to encourage such an impulse in you?
Oh, I see. What do you use instead?
What difference does it make?
I bet.
I'll have you suspended. I'll have you disbarred.
Don't give me that crap. That's MY crap.
Hello Marylin.
...why did she do it, Ruth? Why?
Yeah...
Sure. Count me in.
That's a lot of people to die unknown.
Where?
Sure, whatever. Maybe I'll catch a movie.
Listen, I'm going to make sure Steph and Siena get home safe, and then maybe we'll hook up with you later, okay?
Bye, Stephanie. Bye, Siena, Caryl.
Call me on my cell if you go out.
Yeah.
You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge.
That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said. Gave him the battery. Like you said. Asked him about the seven acres. Like you said.
Those toenails dry yet? We got some dancin' to do.
Yeah, I had my first taste on that trip to Juarez. At that age you still got a lot of energy.
It's a prob'lm I don't think's gonna go away too soon though... Peanut, I'm thinkin' of breakin' parole and takin' you out to sunny California.
You up for that?
Oh no -- this is just getting worse. I am going to find myself, 30 years from now, still on this couch.
Now, don't be like that. Tell you what. How about if I take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?
I mean if you didn't know who I was.
ARE YOU CRAZY?
I think you're homesick. I'll be out at my camp over the weekend. Nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful. John, I'll be back here again Thursday; I'll be in touch. Lieutenant, thank you.
I'd like to live a little longer but -- I'm not afraid to die -- I'm not...
Over -- over so soon -- it has just begun. Oh, the pain.
Try and sleep, Kringelein, don't be afraid.
I get it--Lee Lother have a hand in that, too?
See if she can donate some paintings or something to hang on these walls, give it a bit of atmosphere.
Need any disks?
Quick. Gimme a quarter.
Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
Well what shall I swear by?
If my heart's dear love--
What?
O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
Gimme a quarter.
Maybe.
Who do you think did it -- Gideon?
But Doc-
Nonsense, I have not yet begun to Defile myself.
I think Tex did it.
Well, if it must be, it must. For a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty I ever saw. No officer, bearing His Majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it -- fight you must, and Best is a huge, strong fellow.
He'll give the better mark. I am not afraid of him.
And so I am.
And this is the return you make for his kindness! Didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent-free, your fine house of Jamesville yonder?
Mark this, come what will of it, I swear I will fight the man who pretends to the hand of Dorothy Dugan. I'll follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. I'll have his blood, or he shall have mine. Will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?
From what budget?
The letter.
That's right. But you have a piece of property that still belongs to this newspaper. And I'd like to have it!
No. I've had the whole army and navy searching for you because that's a game we play here every day.
He's not here. It's a blind alley.
The letter from John Doe.
That's the last.
I like to know who's living in my house. I like to know what my boys are up to.
Ahhh.
What are you then?
Well -- I'm just sort of traveling through.
What's that?
I said -- not exactly -- no.
You a student?
Not exactly.
You're not one of those agitators?
No use in getting tough. That'll get you nowhere, Mr. Deeds. You know, we've got letters.
Will you show Mr. Hallor to the front door?
You're making a mistake, Mr. Deeds.
Oh no, I'm not. I don't like your face. Besides, there's something fishy about a person who would settle for a million dollars when they can get seven million. I'm surprised that Mr. Cedar, who's supposed to be a smart man, couldn't see through that.
Now wait a minute, buddy
Be gentle with them, Jack. They only march to please you. Were this a faerie journey, we'd ride the wind on thistledown and ragwort stems.
Of course not.
Unhand that degenerate - you adolescent ass of a one balled donkey!
No...No please...!
I... I was just leaving.
Yes... I... I agree...
It's high time you realized, honey babe, that a woman doesn't have to give the best years of her life to Radcliffe or Smith in order to speak the English language.
Right.
I'm concentrating.
Wait here.
Two is one. Listen, let's just stay on the odd channels and switch everytime. Start in the basement. Now, let's haul ass.
What?
No... I'm not wearing that -- and just in case you were going to ask I'm not going to let you inject me with plaque either.
All right, here's our plan of communication, so as to avoid Smokey.
Running blocker.
Now, if I say go to channel three, it really means go to six.
If I say go to twenty-one, go to nineteen.
Rick... Debbie is mine. She'll always be.
Cole, when was the last time you had a lobotomy?
I never heard that.
They waved him off. He thought he knew better. He hit the ramp.
He was by the book, all the way.
You may not think so, but you are.
It's not true.
Not something they tell dependents.
Kid, the plain fact is...you are. I'm not gonna stand here and blow sunshine up your ass. Technically, they absolved you. You and I know what really happened. You pushed it. You are responsible and you'll always carry that. You know what, I'll carry it too. I should have taken you out of that cockpit. I guess I'm a hopeless romantic... I always try to find something worthwhile in someone's death. It's no trade-off. It's not one for one. What you learned isn't worth his death. It couldn't be. But maybe there is some value in it. I know it's the first thing I've ever seen that's really gotten to you. Now the question is, what will you do with it. If it gets you out of flight status...so you don't kill yourself or anybody else...that's good. That's one good thing. You were an accident waiting to happen.
How can I go on? I feel so... responsible.
Sorry.
What are you talking about?
That little punk -- after all I did for him! He said I couldn't bring anybody to his apartment -- especially not Miss Kubelik. What's he got against you, anyway?
Just walked out on me -- quit -- threw that big fat job right in my face.
He wouldn't give me the key to the apartment.
Only that it's supposed to be a pretty poor sight since the hurricane came through last year.
Interesting choice of words. I don't remember. I just know that I want to.
Well, then I guess this is our first date... or our last. Until now, I wasn't sure it was either.
Is that really what you want to ask me?
Do they have drinks?
You're not accompanying him to New York?
Certain ladies make that very easy... Vivian. John, call a limousine for our guest, please. Have it take her anywhere she wishes to go. Bill the hotel. See you again sometime soon.
Mr. Harris doesn't check out until tomorrow.
Why?
Enzo Molinari.
This is a great pleasure.
Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
You know each other?
We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.
Don't do it, Rob!
He's not worth it!
I dunno.
I shot at one of them.
But you didn't hurt anybody.
Hi.
Who's that?
Just a guard.
Friends never break promises, do they? Okay. Here. Now listen. There are a lot of people outside and they all want you to be safe. You understand that? They said I could come in and bring you out.
Why?
They like you. Okay?
Come on!
I wanted to see you.
What are you doing here?
Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
You're not real.
I wasn't hallucinating.
That's good, Alex. Reassure me.
Well, enough about the King. How about you?
No.
I am once more about to make advertising history. And only you, the original Yoni Yum Dew Girl, could possibly assist me.
Purely personal. I believe you might enjoy one another.
Yes, well, what I'm getting at is that there comes a time when it is psychologically impossible for a woman to lose her virginity. She can't wait too long, you know. Now, there's no reason why you must lose yours. I mean, just ponder it a bit, that's all.
Good evening, Mr. Newberry.
You call her up for yourself, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
I'll call her up.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
Well, what do you feel like doing tonight?
I didn't like her, Angie. I don't feel like calling her up.
Well, let's call her up. What can we lose?
Yeah, sure.
I could see she likes you.
What makes you say that?
Well, we're back to that, huh? I say to you, "What do you feel like doing tonight?" And you say to me, "I don't know, what do you feel like doing?" And then we wind up sitting around your house with a coupla cansa beer, watching Sid Caesar on television. Well, I tell you what I feel like doing. I feel like calling up this Mary Feeney. She likes you.
Just us.
People who don't go into our courts when they're told to sometimes go directly into our jail.
Something's in there. Those flowers have been taken up, and put back again.
I didn't have a chance to wrap it.
I hired them to. We're in my brain. But I want it to stop, before I wake up and don't know you anymore.
Not until recently.
Nervous?
I took the other road. I'm more of a self-reflective young lion who does business with lead-pipe cruelty and goes home to drink light beer in milky-eyes isolation. I love sports and sex and have no real relationships with anyone. And you?
Jack, you don't use a gun, do you?
Okay, what are you going to need to clean it up
Well, this might come in handy.
Mess that kid up?
You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it?
Yes, rather.
Don't you sometimes wonder if it's worth all this? I mean what you're fighting for?
We might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we'll die. If we stop fighting our enemies, the world will die.
What of it? Then it'll be out of it's misery.
You feel like you want to blow your wheels right now?
I just get so-- Boy, sometimes the temperature goes way up. RAY Okay. Okay. Let it out.
Go on--don't give me that. Someone giving you hard looks?
I don't know why--!
And they think they are protecting my by moving.
That why you moved from the last town? 'Cause you were in trouble? You can talk about it if you want to--I know about it anyway. Routine check.
Try the desk.
All the time! I don't know what gets into me--but I keep looking for trouble and I always--I swear you better lock me up. I'm going to smash somebody--I know it.
Get on your knees.
Thank you.
Very well, Herr Laszlo, we will not mince words. You are an escaped prisoner of the Reich. So far you have been fortunate enough in eluding us. You have reached Casablanca. It is my duty to see that you stay in Casablanca.
I... You're not going to understand this.
Whether or not you succeed is, of course, problematical.
Not at all. Captain Renault's signature is necessary on every exit visa. Captain, would you think it is possible that Herr Laszlo will receive a visa?
Yeah, and whose fault is that?
Why not?
Brilliant. Word perfect I'd say.
I mean it, Jack. Behave.
Like an angel.
Uh ... thanks.
Thanks, Lloyd.
And I think the book is the poorer for it.
I'm sure you'd be great in Henry James. But, you know -- this writer's pretty damn good too.
Yeah. I got a letter from Aunt Betty. She says if we don't stop over at Wilkes-Barre she'll never forgive us.
He's not a moron.
We got a party tomorrow night. Can't have the place smelling like shit.
I believe in you.
It was his body that was buried there.
Foley's got it.
What... No... Lydia... I want to speak to... her name is Lydia... I...uh...
Wow. Okay. Calm down. Sorry.
Get outta my life both of ya's.
I knew you'd make it! Where's your girl? Didn't she come?
No.
Naw. That's over with.
Water mains usually go in the winter. It's August 1st.
...Forget it... Goodbye!
Get it straight, Lee isn't into taking risks. He deals with a couple of guys, and he's been dealing with them for years. They're reliable. They're dependable. And, they're safe.
But we can't just dig it up!
The guy's in a coma, Bob.
Don't call the Vice President!
Nightmare...
Look... at some point we're going to have to call the Vice President...
Where's the girl?
She's a little hysterical right now. We've got her upstairs in a laundry room.
What?
What is it?
I don't give a shit.
Bob...
It's private.
You're kidding, right? Tell me what happened, you fucker, or I'll tie your dick in a knot.
No.
It's down the hall.
Fine, thank you. The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.
Then why are you telling me all this bullshit just so you can fuck me?
Now I think you ought to go to sleep.
Don't talk like a child. You're a pro, now get out there and cut!
I'm busy, man.
Yeah?...
Oh yeah?
We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you.
In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you.
Nobody has any rights over me.
Yeah. If you can step up and actually do it. Understand? 'Stead of just talking the talk.
Me?
Walk in a house with me, do this cross- dressin' nigga named Eddie Solomon I used to sell to been dealin' on his own.
Can I do what?
Right now, son.
What-- when?
Look, Glenn, I know you cool, but you don't have to give me no tone of voice, okay? You don't like what I'm saying, you can get out anywhere along here you want.
I don't have to prove shit to you. The Ripley job is my job. You're either in or you're not. You wanna pop some crack dealer pissed you off, that's your problem, not mine.
Hey, shit, come on. I say I want this car, man, it's mine. You go get yourself another one. I say I'm in on Ripley? I'm in, with or without your ass. I say I want you to come along on another job, see if you for real or not, guess what you gonna do?
I think you're forgetting, this is my car. I drove it up here.
Got it.
We're only going one way.
I'm not the one to ask...
There's no sin in charity, Jeanne.
Stop. For just a moment. Mr. Kross, I'd like to ask you a few questions before you sign. You realize that you're a target. If you weren't mine, you'd be someone elses, correct?
Why the fuck am I here? I feel like I'm five years late for the Prom.
What's wrong with you? Why are you acting this way?
No, I'm not.
And I don't.
I'm not in the mood.
No.
What?
Oh. We might. Yes. We can. Let's.
Hey! What's the fun of being a teenager if you can't dress weird? And we're going to have fun tonight, right?
What about when she goes out?
I mean, after that?
You don't have to if you don't want to --
Oh, no. Sometimes I have dinner with Ed Sullivan, sometimes with Dinah Shore or Perry Como -- the other night I had dinner with Mae West -- of course, she was much younger then. Cheers.
You know what we're going to do after dinner?
We're going to finish that gin game.
The bus'll pick you up over there. Uh... you got enough bread for a ticket?
She's losing minutes so you better start running interference or we're never gonna make it. Might I remind you this was your brainstorm.
I'll drop off my fare, hit a quick choke-and-puke and be blocking for you pronto.
She didn't tell me a thing.
Bandit?
It wasn't what I wanted.
I got what I paid for.
What?
I think it's my safest bet, don't you?
You don't understand me.
Moving story.
Is that true?
I was thinking yesterday - yesterday! - the Patient, Hardy: they're everything that's good about England. I couldn't even say what that was. We didn't exchange two personal words, and we've been together through some terrible things, some - he was engaged to a girl in the village! - I mean - and us - he never once He didn't ask me if I could spin the ball at cricket or the kamasutra or - I don't even know what I'm talking about.
Come on, Spicoli. Why don't you just put your shirts back on? See the sign?
I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right.
I think they'll be all right, honey.
Baines is packing up?
And to think what coulda happened in that king-sized bed tonight...
See ya downstairs.
What? You and Madox? Or you and Katharine Clifton?
His honor, I suppose... seeing he no longer can defend it.
Well... if the knight be already dead; what harm is there in... borrowing a thing or two?
Stealing his arms?
Ofttimes, the wee folk come out to tend the wounded... staunch bleeding with cobwebs... give a parched mouth a sip of dew... cool a fevered brow...
There... it seems to quit... I'll wager that war held other attractions quite apart from nursing.
Worse than the battlefield.
What know you of fields of war?
Oona tells me the raven has roosted for the night on a sharp stone spire some half a mile distance.
What?
What do you know about me?
When you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. But then she met Peter and skipped the idea of renting.
See, that's the thing...I am what I say I am.
I know parts of who you are.
He was a prick when I was six, and he's a prick today.
I wish you had told me then.
He's got nothing to do with me.
I couldn't imagine how I could compete with him for any part of you. So, I didn't. He wanted you to have his last name...I let him even take that.
I'm telling you now.
I gave up on you.
Tell the baby about me.
Goodbye.
I love you.
No.
Goodbye.
Please! She has got to see a doctor right away.
All right.
So -- maybe I'm old enough to tell you how to run your life?
One who doesn't glow in the dark.
Stop the tape, okay. Forget it, Ellen. Let's call security and get him out.
Hang on. Did you ever know a Derek Sommersby?
Follow me.
You're joking, right? What are you doing? Un-fucking- believeable. Can we just go back to the hotel and hang out and get up early and play nine holes before we head home?
Figure of speech. Could we go?
What took so long? You were in there all day.
If you're worried about the President, call and warn him about the Space Shuttle.
Uh uh, don't want them to see me.
What are you doing here?
Nah. I have curfew.
You know what, I'm just gonna crash.
Look, this party's whack. You ready to go?
Not really.
Yes -- I was looking for Anna Scott...
Susan, you're a hell of a woman. You've got a great career, you're beautiful --
Don't get carried away.
Listen, I'm crazy about the guy -- He's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry Parrish Communications into the 21st century and me along with it.
Well, I wasn't going to say that --
That's for me. I'm talking about you. It's not so much what you say about Drew, it's what you don't say.
Well, I m just a little confused right now about why I work here...
I mean sales has always been a feeder for M and A, always...
Well, you know -- it's just one day. Today's papers will all have been thrown away tomorrow.
That's not true. And wait a minute... this is crazy behavior. Can't we just laugh about this? Seriously -- in the huge sweep of things, this stuff doesn't matter.
I mean -- today's newspapers will be lining tomorrow's waste paper bins.
Well, there are. And we don't need to go anywhere near that far. My best friend slipped -- she slipped down- stairs, cracked her back and she's in a wheelchair for the rest of her life. All I'm asking for is a normal amount of perspective.
Luck! You fightin' a crazy man -- but you got him hurt bad. More ice, now!
Mild stroke?
Well, start by going on television and saying that he's had a mild stroke...
Like how?
Look, everything can be handled. We'll just find a way to handle it.
Soon.
Up and around? Soon?
Yes - - and that he ought to be up and around sometime soon.
That's a lot of money for a little girl.
Are they still operative?
Oh my.
Hyperactive little fuckers, too. Tough to keep up with in a wheelchair, I bet.
Three different guys?
Well I'm guessing. There's a black kid, two whites, and a midget.
She's in a wheelchair?!
Don't look so shocked, it's been a long time. I bet you've changed a lot over the last twelve years, haven't you?
You may laugh. Caviar and champagne may mean nothing to you, but to me -- they mean a great deal. You see, I'm ill and all of a sudden I got a fear of missing life. I don't want to miss life -- do you understand?
Yes -- and for me, it's going to leave at any minute. Let's drink.
That makes it harder still.
When were you most happy?
When were you least happy?
What else?
Not tweed -- it's a smoother material, with a larger collar and belted.
Fine. My mistake. You know, I'm gonna be a writer myself some day.
Medusa... What's this? some kind of club?
Like an underground club?
And who's Claude?
No, she wasn't.
Watch bingo? I don't even like to play bingo.
No. Just, more activity.
They're not gonna let us in Vada, we're kids.
Hey there's your Dad and Shelly.
That's when we'll do it. And we'll need every single day.
Only a week?
Years ago, if memory serves. When does the exhibit end?
How do you like them jokers? Taking me for a pigeon.
So the Duke dug a tunnel--just in case. They made the lake a hundred years later. Flooded the tunnel.
Maurice Miller, couple of his friends.
You think we have time to fool around like this? Come on.
What gave me away?
Buddy was more a part of the big picture--county political machine, chamber of commerce, zoning board if I kept those people happy, he was pretty much on my side. Whenever somebody thought--they start up another bar for the black folks, they'd be--how should I put this? They'd be officially discouraged.
Yeah, I do.
Pop!
Pop!
It sounds stupid.
Yeah, well what if it's the Weekly World News...
Take it easy.
No -- not Vizzini -- I need the Man in Black --
All night?
Uh-huh.
We might as well do the towels the same way.
Good idea.
Get back there! He'll see you!
It's not an ordinary look. It's the kind of look a man gives when he's afraid somebody might be watching him.
It's no problem. I called Mom and Dad in Germany; it's like they were there.
Wait for me for when I get round to the front.
Well, I'm sure we're all glad to see you came through it all right.
Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called "The Bijou," is that also true?
Yes sir. But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there.
Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... "accident," Mr. Appleton. An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures. Tell us, this "accident" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory?
Yes.
And what is the state of your memory now?
Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory?
I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently "blotted out" as a result of your "accident."
Please? COREY Alright. Alright, Okay, here.
Come on. We don't have much time.
It's orange!
That! You can't wear that!
Is there a language problem here? Your dress. For tonight. Where is it?
That's the usual?
No, no, it's your energy or your attitude or the way you carry yourself or...
I'll have, like, a beer. Like a Budweiser, or something.
Got any more bread crust?
Tonight! How's tonight?
Well, that's fine. Then you are not insinuating that I am avoiding questions. And I am not insinuating that you won't let me examine this report.
I was only asking if you are related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
And I was only asking you if you would let me examine your report without interruption.
I don't see why any man should get excited when he is asked about his hometown.
Thanks.
I haven't been sleeping. I haven't been clear or felt like myself. I'm in trouble. Some son of a bitch is burning my bridges behind my back... But the tiredness -- boy... Not just sleepy.
Who?
Is he in the bathroom?
Alright, I love you too. Go to sleep.
Why not?
Well, maybe it isn't to you, but it certainly is a business to me, if I have to make up a loss of 180,000. If it's losing that much money, there must be something wrong. Maybe you charge too much. Maybe you're selling bad merchandise. Maybe lots of things. I don't know. You see, I expect to do a lot of good with that money. And I can't afford to put it into anything that I don't look into. That's my decision for the time being, gentlemen. Goodbye, and thank you for making me Chairman.
Yeah, I'm here.
In my room.
Why, I turned them down, naturally.
Huh.
How did you know that was me?
If she comes over here, Max, my brain is going to turn into guacamole.
With you?! Who is 'you'? Did you tell her who you are?
I didn't sleep. They're giving me less and less air time. They don't think I'm at all anchor material.
Last time Paul was sick they gave Connie the weekend news instead of me.
You make me nervous. Anyway if I can pick your brain --
Sure. No problem.
My name's Salvatore...And yours?
Chaplin's Modern Times! Right, Toto?
That's right, Modern Times.
I've shown it so many times I know it by heart. The first time I showed it, in 1940, was the Sunday my first wife died. They kept it hidden from me all day so they wouldn't have to close down the movie house. I only found out that night, after the last show. Those are things you never forget... So, Toto, how are these home movies going?
Yes.
What is it, what is it? What's the picture?
It's people in the slaughter-house killing a calf. There's blood all over the floor, like a lake. And through this lake another calf passes by on its way to die.
Listen, Elaine -- it seems to me that there isn't a bar in here. I mean -- as far as I know.
Can we split now?
What?
Lovely. How is your gold digging whore of a mother enjoying Bali? Zipping through my inheritance per usual?
Do you care to tell me what Mrs. White-trash and her stupid daughter are doing in my house?
That's ridiculous.
What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
Okay. I like that.
Adam, I think for you, we should go for "sweet."
Um... Eve?
My lady friend has a personality disorder.
I were you, I'd get up and run.
I want it...
Thank you...
And now I don't know where my mother is. She may be lost.
What...?
Yeah, baby, I know what you like to hear...
Yeah, you know, probably one of these fast-talking career gals, thinks she's one of the boys. Probably is one of the boys, if you know what I mean.
Yeah, you know. Suffers from one of these complexes they have nowadays. Seems pretty obvious, doesn't it? She's probably very unattractive and bitter about it.
Yeah, you know. Probably dresses in men's clothing, swaps drinks with the guys at the local watering hole, and hobnobs with some smooth talking heel in the newsroom named Biff or Smoocher or...
We've never actually met. My Name's-
My--uh...
Hey look at this, no feet!
Oh, thanks. Well, have a good time.
Don't rush to judgement until all the facts are in.
Why don't we just do his job then, so we can do our job, and get the fuck out of here.
Do his job? I'm not a cold-blooded killer.
I'm all right. I just need to rest up a wee bit. The room ... You don't have to stay.
The place is a mess.
I can't move to tidy.
It's what the maids are for.
I'm not having some prattler going through my things.
Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her.
She needs me, Archie. She canna do without me, she said it to my face. How can I stop now?
You sent for me.
I've been called back to London. My last day. I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar.
Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. You must miss such magnificent views.
O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
You're insane!
You drunken idiot! Arrest him! The idea of coming here with a cock-and- bull story like that!
Throw him out, Frank.
Who is this man?
It's a frame-up! Some imposter!
I have a message for you from your "niece", sir.
You got a brew?
Truth is I usually get along better with animals than with people. In Nepal the villagers call me 'Kin-tan- tee', which means 'man who is loved by many animals... ...who love him a lot, too... and so on.'
'That right?
Oh, Pufferball likes his little tum- tum rubbed, doesn't he now?
Field trip?
Your mother still doesn't like me.
What? How do you know that?
Thanks. That was good, that crow sound.
A man who can't control his woman is funny.
Don Ciccio, I've got an idea...You remember that old abandoned movie house where they're supposed to build those low-rent houses?
The projector's all rusty, but I could fix it in two or three days. Give the place a good cleaning, put in some seats and bring in a projectionist and we'll show Catene in two houses.
Yes. I want proof.
For example, at this moment the film's out of focus. Go see.
Me!
What was she like in school?
She knows stuff about me that only you know.
No. I mean it, thank you.
Beth. I didn't mean what I said. About --
Bye.
Page a hundred and twelve.
Do you guys feel like painting?
Red.
Either do you.
You don't look like you.
Do you like red?
I thought I might be able to help, but it looks like you have all you can handle.
Why did you say that?
Meet someone?
The gloves on the table are for you.
What?
I was afraid.
What about him?
Oh. Yes? Just a minute. If you don't mind -- this is sort of personal
Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did. You've got to remember that. You've got to.
But I...
She's too powerful, Raziel
Sure.
What?
I said, are you deaf as well as stupid?
There you go.
You've still got a chance with Nadia, right?
No. Her sponsors here saw the thing on the net. I don't think they liked it.
Hey, minuteman.
Shut up. You're supposed to be supportive.
Yeah? Well come prom night, those excuses aren't going to do you much good.
Jesus, Kevin, rub it in.
How do you know that?
She's already on a plane back home.
Ten pounds.
It's for Henslowe. He paid me.
I swear it. He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.
Done.
I've come this far... here I am, in your house. I want you to let me pay the rent for this month. All right?
I swore not to talk about him tonight, but there's all this stuff I think I ought to tell you, that he didn't get a chance to. Rafe was...he was lonely. He had such high expectations of himself that he always felt empty. The week he met you he told me he felt his heart had always lived in winter, and for the first time in his life he has seen the spring.
Why not --
Well, friends can tell each other anything, right? If we have our "friends" hats on --
For loyalty, you buy a dog. For love, you get married.
Airight. Here's why you don't have your ten million dollars yet. You are a paycheck player. You play with your head. Not your heart. In your personal life? Heart. But when you get on the field -- 113.
Mia...?
What?
Won't take two.
You said three minutes.
When did you get back?
I want to fly, sir!
No way, Mayo. You don't give a shit about anybody but yourself and every single one of your classmates knows it. Think they'd trust you behind the controls of a plane they have to fly in? Hey, man, I figure you for the kind of guy who'd zip off one day in my F-14 and sell it to the Cubans.
Sir, this candidate believes he'll make a good officer, sir!
Sell it to the Air Force, Mayo!
Sir, that's not true! I love my country!
No you're not. You're failing the big one, baby, and I don't just mean in here. I mean in life. I've watched you, Mayo, and you don't mesh. You grab-ass and joke around but you don't make friends, not the way the others do.
I've decided not to run for President.
Rick's got an important announcement to make.
We're going for a little liquid refreshment.
I will, Marietta. Goodbye now.
So, it's back to the islands.
Why not? How was the fishin'?
If you don't, we can kiss that Kenworth good-bye.
Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in.
Johnny
You might want to pass it along to Mac.
Listen to me, Johnny. Come in! You're out there all alone... We're getting close... real close... Maybe if you listen to me for a minute we can work something out so you can come in
Pick up the hat.
Ahm...
Oh, I forgot all about it. How's the hands?
Good. I'd hate to think I was putting my money on a cripple.
Bill --
You give your word, I give mine -- that we'll do what we say. It's a truth exchanged between two people.
A 'deal'?
It is a deal?
Sounds fair enough.
And I won't tell anyone who you are.
Good-bye, Frankie.
Hey, you're the psychic. Eve, the psychic pimp. You tell me.
What's it to you?!
Uh..he might of.
How come you didn't catch your bus?
Then why go to the bus station?
Around.
Cramped. You always drink like this, so early in the morning?
No, not always.
Maybe a drink would help you.
It should've been me...
Help yourself.
Sure. I remember . . . Say, did your ears pop coming up in the elevator? Mine did.
Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
Mm.
We may go out for coffee after the meeting so don't expect us before midnight.
You know where the fire extinguisher is.
This is not cool.
A little misunderstanding among my associates.
No harm no foul.
Come on, live a little. I'm sorry about the incident yesterday.
I told them to kill you and they didn't.
I'm assigning a couple Blue Shields to protect you around the clock, just in case.
In 76 years, me neither.
Maybe we should've tried to hop it.
The dirty snowball at its core.
Do you believe you'll see your mother again?
Teamwork -- that's what counts in an organization like this. All for one and one for all -- know what I mean?
I have a vague idea.
A .45--
Colt Peacemaker.
Oh? Did they do that sort of thing way back in your day?
Pretty good, huh? I taught them everything they do.
What's the matter?
It's lovely.
Adam!
I'm not hungry -- isn't it glorious?
You don't look so bad in this light.
It's all right -- look.
I thought maybe you wanted me to see the kind of work the competition was turning out.
Why do you think I brought you here?
Uh huh... And, supposing I believed that, what could I do about it?
Okay... dead or undead... what do you want from me?
Exactly! What is it Johana? You're so crazy about him, you don't see the truth?!
No, no, get away, get away from me...
What?
Gotta be in person.
Well, what happened to you?
I'll say--how fast is this boat going?
Yeah.
Is she running a temperature? What is it?
I'm going over to the other side.
Going up to see Zuzu.
Pretty good--thirty miles an hour--
Don't blame it on the ocean!--All right, you'll get the raise!
Oh, do yuh?
I mean, d- He can give you- Do you hafta give it so loud? I mean, aren't you ashamed to pontificate like that? And- and the funny part of it is, M- Marshall McLuhan, you don't know anything about Marshall McLuhan's... work!
Tell him.
Well, that's funny, because I happen to have Mr. McLuhan right here. So... so, here, just let me- I mean, all right. Come over here... a second.
Nothing you couldn't find out from reading the papers. And you're already wrong on one count.
..Ha...Little fella? I mean the man talks to invisible people - he sees invisible horses - and he's naked in the middle of Central Park. I should be surprised? I'm not surprised. I'm fucking outta my mind to even be here!
Yeah, it's just a coincidence.
She'll be fine.
Oh, no. Just right. Your age fits you. Yes, sir, you look a little older without your clothes on.
You can't do this! This is New York! Nobody lies in naked in a field in New York..It's...it's too Midwestern.
Your . . . your caboose, my lady.
Okay, then, I'll throw a rock at the old Granville house.
Ummmmm . . .
We can go to one if you'd prefer.
Sarah -- with an H?
Have you ever done any cloudbusting? You lie on your back and you concentrate on the clouds...and you try yo break them apart with your mind. It's wild.
Go out, go out by the Sung vase and, and catch this.
Come on! Hurry up! Let's go!
So what's the, uh, problem this time?
This time I really think I have something.
Hang on.
So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
You need to know what? Do I still love you?
You bit my finger.
Let's not do this, okay?
Good afternoon.
Rather an obvious question under The circumstances, don't you Agree? A better one might be how Do you feel?
How you feelin', Doc?
Yes but I get tense and I feel like I can't be myself if that happens.
I don't think I'm going to the party.
Please don't.
...please, I just don't want it....
Yeah, no, it's not, it's just --
Lisa, I won't be able to give you any --
Well that's fine, but I only have one bed, and --
That's a suitcase?
I'd be no better than Thorwald, to refuse.
Whoa. Remind me.
Uh huh.
Say you love me.
My God! I'm glad I didn't go.
I was, later.
Did the driver really freeze?
Oh, you know... a lot of people aren't too old for clubs but they're too old for acid jazz and garage and ambient and all that. They want to hear old funk and Stax and New Wave and Old School Hip Hop and some new stuff all together and there's nowhere for them.
This is good work... unfortunately it's incomplete. Could you eat a sandwich 40 floors above the street.
Oh, well, the Kinky Wizards are -- you know what? Why don't I just make you a tape?
Johana, am I boring you?
But he had a spare D-6, you said. Right there. Why not use that?
I'm sorry if we disturbed you.
The scandal -- we are men -- you -- you could take that affair of the young lady upon yourself -- take her and hold your tongue. Then you can travel -- I'll give you anything -- anything -- she was with you.
We must call the police, your excellency.
I can answer for this, it was self- defense -- I can answer for this -- but that girl -- the scandal -- my wife -- my daughters, you know them?
Yes, I know them --
How much -- how much do you want -- you need money -- you have nothing.
Don't worry about me, Mr. General Director Pryesing -- worry about yourself. There has been a murder -- this is room one sixty-four.
I may have to put the wedding on hold is all.
Oh, you've been thinking. And?
It was dead. We had it tested. Maybe the D-6 was the spare and he had to use it.
How do you think I got to be a colonel?
Do whatever they tell you--
Because it's a job?
Well, I've been doing some thinking.
Hey! What is this, the planes all bunched up like that?
Sorry...um - you - you know it's gone right out of my head --
Yeah, something he goes by --
Wondrously so.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You remember?
But the bottom line is: I'm not Paramount. I have a select group of distributers I deal with. I buy their little movies. Accomplish what I wanna accomplish, end of story. Easy, business-like, very little risk.
Does this thing have guns, John Parker?
I thought I was going faster.
Pull up! We did it! Holy shit, we did it! Pull up!
Faster!
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Oh no.
Here. It looks like you need a refill.
Believe me, if you weren't so tiresome, I'd have one for you.
I love it. She's got a hundred million bucks. She fucks fighters and rock and roll stars. And she's got a degree in screwing with peoples' heads.
Are you kidding me?
Glad to see you again.
... It is much better down there. It's a better place.
You have to say that. You're my student.
What kinda man lets a woman answer the door, this time a night?
... I was right about what?
Have they got Midge up there?
I didn't make up the name. It's the Steely Dan song. And it was in The Commitments.
A minute or two, you're gonna wish you were.
We thought it might be her husband. Sometimes he comes and checks up on her. She told him I was down in Florida.
I can't.
I... I can't stop her.
Just one pair! You owe me that much, you heartless bitch!
We're in love with your roommate.
So you think you can get me?
Not exactly. I ve seen you on CNBC. You look taller in real life...
Peter Lassiter...
Yeah. That's right.
You bet it's a heavy sedation! The fetus is unexpelled, her uterus is punctured, she has acute peritonitis, and there's a foreign object. I think it's a crochet hook.
It's all good. Breath check.
You can crash at Stifler's?
Finch, you can be the one to date a nearly-dead insane chick. Eat your damn imitation hot dog.
Alright...I'm shooting for a nine o'clock ETA. Beer in hand by five after.
"Fun loving" -- insane.
Ooh, here's an easy one: "Attractive SWF, fun loving and a youthful mind seeks outgoing companion." Okay..."Attractive"...ugly.
No, "Charming" is old. "Older" is really old. "Youthful mind" is dead.
Unlisted age, plus "youthful mind," equals old.
What kind of sleazoid geek would turn her in?
What a coincidence, I am someone! Mmm. Calvin Klein's Obsession. Now it's mine too.
Okay, sister, you get your job back.
Where'd you come from?
Excuse... excuse me, when do I go on?
M'm.
It's always some kind of an excuse. It's- You know, you used to think that I was very sexy. What... When we first started going out, we had sex constantly... We're-we're probably listed in the Guinness Book of World Records.
What-what-I don't... It's not natural! We're sleeping in a bed together. You know, it's been a long time.
What bonus?
Stop being nuts!
I do care about you!
What about giving the other guy a break.
If I was going to charge you, I would have told you beforehand. I thought I explained that.
Is this for last night?
Don t they have a limit at those machines?
Here's my passport.... Please give me a visa. I have to leave for Russia immediately.
Count Leon d'Algout... a count!... a nobleman!
Pardon me, I am very interested in what you just said -- you mean when an envoy goes back to Russia -- if they don't like what he has done they put him out of the way?
Not always... look at me... I've been back twice.
Business.
What business?
Don't hold that against me... please!
Why should an aristocrat want to go to Russia?
Private.
There is no privacy in Russia. This whole thing seems very suspicious. What's the real reason? If you ever want to get into Russia, take my advice... confess!
Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
I told you I'm your guardian angel. I know everything about you.
Ridiculous of you to think of killing yourself for money. Eight thousand dollars.
I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
Angel, Second Class.
Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.
My father is a genius.
Oh, was that me you put to bed? Thanks. I've been looking all over for you.
Nothing. Heard you were in town.
Get out --
She drank liquid oxygen.
Why do you think she hasn't suggested that? It's the most obvious solution: Escape. She knows she can't leave here --
Hello, Denby!
I don't care about that. There's time left. You can have more money. You can drink all you want. You can talk or listen. Just stay, that's all I want.
Of course.
Want a drink? I'm having one.
Maybe another drink first. More tequila?
Bobby Peru grab you now... Hold you tight... Feel everythin' in you now... Stay quiet... Say "fuck me" and then I'll leave.
Say it!... I'LL TEAR YOUR FUCKIN' HEART OUT, GIRL... Say "fuck me" soft - then I'll leave. Say "fuck me"... Whisper it... Then I'll leave... Say it... Say it - Say it - Say it...
Whisper it... Whisper "fuck me"... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper... Whisper...
Someday honey, I will... But I have to be goin' now... Conta i no joras...
Decent? I guess any guy could be decent--if you were interested.
He's getting away from me, Fezzik. Please. FEZZIK!
I'll be right back.
Some people say it's the most virile sport in the world. One has to admit that when you see those men diving head first in that deep blue sea, all muscles contracted in one super human effort...
Enzo?
I'll take the whole set.
Is he a friend, then?
Nay. I show no pity to imps and fiends.
Hold, Jack! Don't strike!
I'm sending you back to Hell!
No... not really... I mean, I think about it... but no, I don't really think about it.
Think about what I said. I mean, if you want to experiment, or whatever --
I don't want to. Don't need to. I love you.
I think the big question here is where are you, if you don't mind my saying so, and I think I know where you are. You're running. On the run. You're running from a point that everyone hits in any relationship, and you're just going to hit it again with Ian but it's going to be with a World Music bunny- rabbit-looking earth-shoe-wearing "Doctor Who"-watching twit who doesn't really understand you, not the way that I do and will more in the future, and you'll have just wasted more time and arrive in the exact same place that you're in now, only later. And with... him.
The Clockworks is one reason that I am here on Siwash Ridge. I accepted the invitation to be initiated as a shaman by an aged Siwash chief who was the principle outside confederate of the Clock People.
So do you.
It's not going to be lonely, Judy. Not for you and not for me.
It is for me too.
I can't blame the ocean--it's you.
Oh, that's tasty.
Why?
Just tell me.
I won't--I'll ask for one right now. Sally tells me she's in love with you.
And what does he say to you?
What do they do to you boys in those Ivy league schools, anyway? Strap you down and pump the Nature out of you? They can even press the last drop of Nature out of a Mohawk buck. Why, send a shaman or cannibal to Yale for four years and all he'd be fit for would be a desk in the military-industrial complex and a seat in the third row at a Neil Simon comedy. Jesus H.M.S. Christ! If Harvard or Princeton could get hold of the Chink for a couple of semesters they'd turn him into a candidate for the Bow Tie Wing of the Hall of Wimps. Oogie boogie.
Like what?
Things change. Anyway, you gave up your claim to that love the first time you stuck your dick in Maxine.
Oh. Well, yes and no. It wasn't an official call. He's just a friend. An old, ornery friend.
That's true. Oh, God, Lotte, what have I become? My wife in a cage with a monkey. A gun in my hand. Betrayal in my heart.
Stella, I -- I can't tell you what a welcome sight this is. No wonder your husband's still in love with you.
Huh?
Yes, I would.
I meant to, but something always held me up. I love you very much, Ilsa.
Please, Ilsa, don't be hasty.
Rich. Young. Beautiful. You must at least get a kick out of what he does to his kids.
Hey you're not eating your meatloaf.
Courage, Willow.
Yo, Rock. I made a few phone calls an' thanks to me ya goin' to be a big man -- Thatta dog?
Ya right -- Mebbe we best just hold hands -- the shirt made me feel guilty, y'know.
No... Sharp -- You look great.
Adrian, you really look great, y'know -- But I can't fool around durin' trainin' -- makes the legs weak.
Can't fool around -- You look very great.
Yeah... But I think weak legs ain't bad sometimes, y'know.
She was killed, Penny.
Banishment? Be merciful, say death; for exile hath more terror in his look much more than death. Do not say Banishment.
Jack.
Jack.
Frank.
You cannot continue to walk in at the last moment, Jack.
You want me to show up late a few nights?
That's not the point.
What's the point?
How we ... ? What, are you kidding me?
Am I late?
Nurse.
I'm just thinking of how she's hurting. Lost. Alone. Like her life is over.
Oh my dear yes, I bought a little ranch out West, sort of a tribute to the women of America who have cooperated with me in eliminating their odor by using my vaginal products, Dew spray mist and Yoni Yum spray powder. A tax write-off, actually.
She's a young thing who works on my ranch. Real name is Sally Jones or something wooden like that. She's cute as a hot fudge taco, and, of course, it takes verve to change one's name so charmingly. But she stinks like a slut just the same.
What? Oh yes. Tee-hee. Jellybean.
No, just a couple of surfers with no shirts on. I took care of it, Dennis.
They were left over from the last shift.
But they weren't mine.
Promise you'll turn around if you get tired.
I'm not agreeing. Don't think I'm agreeing, because I'm not.
Don't go over it again, please.
I just wanted you to know. I'm not missing you yet. She nods, can't find this funny.
I'm still here.
But yesterday... that actor asked you who I was... and you just dismissed me out of hand... I heard -- you had a microphone... I had headphones.
You were saying...
Can you tell her I'll ring her back.
Okay -- perfect timing as ever -- hold the fort for a second will you, Martin?
Don't go to pieces. I haven't got time tonight.
Your name. And --
I'm going back inside.
Who you are --
Bathroom over there?
Preysing?
Oh -- oh, Miss Flaemmchen. It's you --
Oh -- what -- what --
Hi, Dad. Dad, this is Jessica.
It's nice to meet you, Jessica.
How do you know?
Dad, could you close the door?
Dad, this is amazing. If you play this backwards, it says "Paul is dead."
I know.
No, you dump the van, meet me at the airport. I'll take one of Ripley's cars.
-- and how you happen to be living here.
Jack --
Just blunt talk, okay? I'd really appreciate bluntness.
Upper management thinks you're dull.
Wait. Bullshit me a little...I'm beginning to appreciate it.
I could do it this Saturday -- everyone wants off for the Correspondents' Dinner.
Do it then.
I wish I could tell you I remembered something new, but I can't.
Tighter 'n a bulls ass in fly season. Don't hit the barn.
Which wasn't too hard, the guy was a real squid.
Nicholson and I go to work on him. Now er know somthing's rotten in Denmark, 'cause this dickhead had a big bag, and it's uncut, too, so we're sweatin' him, trying to find out where he got it. Scarin' the shit outta him.
Okee-dokee. It's like this, Krinkle; a patrol car stops this dork for speeding, they walk up to window and the guy's covered in coke. So they bring his ass in and me an' Nicholson go to work on him.
Krinkle, this is it. We got it, man. And it's all ours. I mean talk about fallin' into somethin'. You shoulda seen it, it was beautiful. Dimes is hittin' him from the left about being fucked in the ass by niggers, I'm hittin' him form the right about not likin' pussy anymore, finally he starts cryin', and then it was all over -
Now listen, this is the plan. As soon as school is finished we go to Utah and...
Please come, please.
I need you.
Actually, it all starts tomorrow. It's one of those four-day weddings, with all the traditional events, and ten million people flying in from Madagascar such.
Well, the Sox are at home. SI's letting me do a profile on the Big Hurt. That's Frank...
Is it really your camper?
Don't play games with me, Ted.
I get why you're angry. It's no snap to explain why I was like that, but let's not try to do it on the run...
Rose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and --
I just love her. How're you doing?
He's so spooked he'd turn over his momma, his daddy, his two-panny granny, and Anna and the King of Siam if he had anything on him.
Sorry, didn't realize she was right there. Did you have sex with her?
What did she say?
Will you let me ask you some questions?
Sorry to track you down like this. I'm not a stalker. But I needed to see you.
I want a martini! On this bar, right now! I've had a martini in every bar on the way down here, and I'm not about to --
... so Mom. Truly no grudges -- truly. A little odd that you didn't come to see me when you heard I was hurt, but the important thing I want you to know is your son is happy. I'm working again. I'll make do -- I don't want a thing. Wouldn't take it if it was offered. I'll drop you a note from wherever I land and then it's up to you. I hope we patch things up but know that if we don't, I wish you both the very best... I can't hear you. You heard me, though, right? Good -- take good care. 'Bye.
Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
You always do.
Sure.
Come right in - I'll get you a drink.
Hello, Joe.
It's all right. Bring him in.
...You son of a --
"Part the gates of heaven," as it were --
Inspector McKinney.
...in a really horrible way.
Huh?!
Ah... I shouldn't... on duty.
I'll come with you.
...Oh, it's you! Lookin' for a nitwit to buy your lunch?!
Thank you, but I hardly think --
Probably. But when I do, it'll be to someone who thinks of life as more than a new dress, a lobster dinner, and the latest scandal. I need a woman who'll go anywhere, do anything, and love it.
The only honest thing to do is call it off. Let her look for somebody else.
That's the hard part.
There's an intelligent way to approach marriage.
We've progressed emotionally in --
Yo, can I have my locker back?
You want to come out to the house tomorrow? The way the bookings been piling up, Donna's decided to really lay it on. Turkey, stuffing, the whole bit. Kitchen's so full of food you can hardly move. We could use another appetite.
Thanks, but I've got plans.
All right, but if you change your mind, let me know. I gotta go get Ma in the morning anyway.
If you think you're getting credit for this, you're crazy.
No.
Reggie -- ? Did you find it?
No, Jean-Louis.
Saving them some paperwork.
So have I.
What's your name?
Not anymore.
New York.
Then check the connections.
The voltage looks fine.
I just said I didn't fuck around. But you got your head so far up your ass it took a cheap date for you to notice me.
Yeah, that looks better. Thanks.
Does that help?
For the kids. Merry Christmas, you two. Don't forget. We leave the twenty-sixth.
You know what they say -- there's nothing like home.
Well, we're back home.
Foley? That you?
His brother.
Maybe you better not try... I worked so hard to keep quiet. Like a mouse. I should have realized.
Henry Finch. That they monitor everything. That it was only a matter of time. And now four people are dead.
So, no...immediate suspicion, no...general talk of enmity between the two.
These are fishermen, Alvin. They don't talk at all to each other and less to me. Specially gossip.
I know you do. Don't you disappear. You do whatever you have to, to hold on... I'll tell you one more thing... When Pilgrim reared up to face that truck... you know what I think?... I think that damn horse loved you so much, he was trying to protect you... That's what I think.
In my mother's drawer.
I don't know. End up in the electric chair?
No. I'm gonna wait.
Who's "Patty."
So you did talk about it, huh?
Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
You are the wisest person I know.
I don't dance.
I'm Crash Davis.
Well, I really don't smoke.
The ice is melting.
I think I see it.
That's jolly.
That's okay.
Nobody else had it.
Look, I'm junior man -- and it's your beat.
This is my first time at the White House. Is there any chance to look at where he works and the rest of it?
You think I can't learn that?
Well, I don't think he's really been embarrassed by it.
Today is tomorrow.
The Vice Squad?
Sure, Sparky. I'll get right on it.
Did you write this?
Holy smokes! Wasting my time listening to this mad woman.
If he lets you down I'll try my hand at sleuthing-- Bet I could find that bracelet--
Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?
Oh, c'mon, Laura. Just say something. Lie, if you want. It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.
Okay, that's cool, okay. But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?
You know the difference.
Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?
So if you disappoint them from the start, you're covered?
A soft side? Who knew?
So how'd you get Chapin to look the other way?
Yes
So what's your excuse?
In other words, madame, it embarrasses you to offer me the twenty thousand francs reward.
How come you're not older?
Everybody knows who you are. You're famous.
I found it out a little late. I'm worth more dead than alive.
Hey, stop by the shop.
We got his stinkin' ass in the deepest, darkest cell in the whole place. But it just so happens that right now he's got a special visitor.
Now look, you mustn't talk like that. I won't get my wings with that attitude. You just don't know all that you've done. If it hadn't been for you . . .
Oh. Okay. I'll catch ya tomorrow then.
I was gonna do something with Joan.
Oh yeah... Me, too. You want to get dinner later?
I'll be right back, baby, really.
Nobody special enough, Curly.
I don t care if you re Tim Allen with your fancy car and all your tools, you still can t park here.
Tell me you recognize me, Arnie. Please...
Why, may one ask?
What's up, Doc?
Well, we didn't have a camera...so she just wrote the date on the bag and said, quot;This will be out wedding album, this will be a day we will never forget. quot; We never did.
What's the difference? We've got him. Help me here. We'll have to force feed him.
I've got something better.
He's a genius. They're not photographs -- they're stories, entire histories captured in moments.
Inigo -- there's more than thirty --
We performed on the beach one summer...ha...everything went wrong.
Would you like...eh...to have these movies?
How long do we have to wait before we know if the miracle works?
Your guess is as good as mine --
You're forty-two years old, Johnny, and Mama is still running your life.
Is it someone we know?
I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
K is for Katharine.
Say you're sick.
Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
I can still taste you.
Pinching me!
But... I am a Green Man. I have no title, nor lands... scarce even a few vines and threads to keep the cold from my body.
Ouch! Something's biting me.
Nah, not yet. Look, you're my older brother. I need some advice here. What's the deal with marriage? What can I expect?
How about Nick? Did he take good care of you?
What?
No?
What?
Got another song for us?
I need to talk to you for a second.
Hi.
How were you gonna get home?
Truman used it all the time.
I don't mind.
I said I wonder if you could help me.
I wonder if you could help me.
You gotta give me some money.
What?
I don't know.
So what's that mean? That you're disappointed by what you found or you're sorry you robbed all those banks?
Yeah, I did.
You find out?
It wasn't about getting laid. I just wanted to know what might've happened if things were different.
You've been very cold to me tonight.
Not yet. You want to go?
I bet mom could've helped her.
He remarried. Apparently they were having an affair for years. Apparently the first Mrs. Delaney was a bit of a stiff.
Go to the Symphony --
I found out who Lucy Delaney is. Remember the Delaneys from Hillcrest Road?
I don't know. Um...I'm just antsy.
Was I?
Patrick, Pat, you're not looking at the big picture. Joey's just a pawn. We set this whole thing up so Cameron can get the girl.
That's where we can help you. With Kat.
Yeah -- we'll see.
And he means that strictly in a non- prison-movie type of way.
Well, that's what you get for falling in love with a guy who's first name is Ramblin'.
Stan, you're depressing me... Hey, I didn't know you were going to fill 'er up. Just take a couple of gallons, okay?
That's an even trade... a cotton ball for all my blood.
My lady Viola.
Chelsea 2-5598.
L. B. Jefferies.
Well, what then, sergeant?
Is that so? You might marry me?
So he was indicted?
Sorry, Flip. Got sidetracked.
Flip was a hero in Vietnam.
You're a hard man to trust, sir. You sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...
Hey, what am I-your son? Whatta you mean? I-I came over to --
Well, I was in be- It's three o'clock in the morning. You, uh, you got me outta bed, I ran over here, I couldn't get a taxi cab. You said it was an emergency, and I didn't ge- I ran up the stairs. Hell - I was a lot more attractive when the evening began. Look, uh, tell- Whatta you- Are you going with a right-wing rock-and- roll star? Is that possible?
They do to!
Not now, Elaine.
Don ' t you even dare. . .
Because I like to torture you.
Whatever you do, love it like you loved that projection booth of the Paradiso when you were little...
Who said that? Gary Cooper, James Stewart, Henry Fonda? Huh?
No, Toto, nobody said it. I say it! Life's not like you saw it in the movies. Life...is harder. Get out! Go back to Rome. You 're young, the world is yours! And I'm old...I don't want to hear you talk any more, I want to hear talk about you.
Thanks for all you've done for me.
It was probably meant to be like this. Each of us has a star to follow. So now what are you thinking of doing?
Listen to this one...The commander says to the sergeant: 'You remember that windmill that used to be there?' 'Yes, sir, I remember the mill's gone but the wind's still there!' You remember the story of the soldier and the princess?
Now I understand why the soldier went away just before the end. That's right, just one more night and the princess would have been his. But she, also, could not have kept her promise. And...that would have been terrible, he would have died from it. So instead, for ninety-nine nights at least he had lived with the illusion that she was there waiting for him...
Do like the soldier, Toto! Go away! This land is cursed. When you're here every day you feel like you're at the center of the universe, it seems like nothing ever changes. Then you go away, one year, two...And when you come back, everything's different. The thread has broken. You don't find those you were looking for, your things no longer exist. Isn't that the case?...You've got to go away a long time, for many, many years, before coming back and finding your people again, the land where you were born...But not now, it's impossible. Now you're blinder than I am.
Swimming.
Why didn't you call me?
Where'd they go?
What do you mean 'free'?
Free to love each other. Com- pletely. Totally. No fear.
What would you say if you knew it was me who brought down Bill Parrish? I told Drew and the Board that Bill depended on you. Drew led me on, but I had no business telling him in the first place. He was setting up Bill from day one. Drew and Bontecou are going to chop up the company and sell it off for parts. Bontecou was outside, Drew was Mr. Inside. And I was the fool who made it all happen. Oh God, what do I do?
Yes. Some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.
When?
It's tight.
That's over. I got tired of translating everything. She thought the Big Hopper was a hamburger.
Oh, God, Dion.
About an hour ago. I had to hand over all our cash.
I'll never give up.
Yeah. Johnny Friendly and my brother had other ideas.
Such as what?
Listen, this ain't for publication.
Remember the first round how I had him against the ropes, and
I'll never forget it. I thought it was all over.
Yeah. My own blood and they sell me out for a lousy bet I had it in me to hit the top and Boy, if I wanted to, the things I could tell you about them guys
Well, I better get going. Hit those stairs again. Was that a looping right or an uppercut the first time you caught him?
Looping right! I never swung wild. I was strictly a short puncher hooks over 'n under whop-whop!
Yeah.
What?
Hey.
All right now, what happened? How did it start?
Yes, dear!
As I recall, you were on your way home. And I didn't want you to go so, yes, I told you a little white lie.
How does anything like this ever start? All I know is the bank called our loan.
Thanks.
Ya puttin' me on, right?
What'd it say?
'Yes'.
'Yes' to the deal?
Maybe, who knows? You know how voices are. Let's go.
Well, it's a big day. Wanted to line up a few ducks before kickoff. Any thoughts? Last minute refine- ments or variations?
A voice?
In my sleep.
Hi, Bill --
Good morning, Quince.
Ernie's.
Every cent of it, and it still was less than we owe.
That's all right, Doc. Don't worry.
I gotta help her. I gotta help Dad. I gotta help everybody.
Valerie's crying!
Fun and games. Evidently we're the floorshow.
How -- how long does she have?
No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti!
If there is a God, how could he let this happen??!!
Lay on, MacDuff.
What do you want?
Tell me what?
Yes, ma'am.
What's too late about it? Look, we're not dead, are we? That's the only thing that's too late.
Yes, ma'am?
Ma'am?
Ma'am.
Some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in- dulging. It's missing everything that matters.
I'll check on that. I'm afraid this is kinder dull for you.
Bill, I'd like you to meet Vivian.
I really doubt anyone here frequents Hollywood Boulevard.
Tie it to both ankles -- Leave two feet slack.
Not 'til you get about three hundred yards from the summit. That's been my experience anyway.
Oh cripes. Do you have change for a dollar? All I have is these stupid Nepalese coins.
I'm gonna get a soda, you want one?
Well... it's just a condo really. Right outside Katmandu.
Not in months. I don't even know why I bought the damn place.
She's right, Paley. You've got to kill me. She doesn't have to -- she's free -- she can't be tried again -- but you, you planned it with her. You supplied the Coke. You're an accessory to murder.
Nobody can make that shot and you know it. Not even a lucky lush.
Don't you see what she's doing? She needs you to kill me. She's planned it that way from the start. That's why she phoned me tonight.
Get out!
Where is Elaine?
Let's go tell your Mother.
Whaddya mean?
Would you grab my shampoo?
The real story is that my mother was a hippie. And a stripper. She was insanely inappropriate with me. She used to wash her lingerie in my bathwater. While I was still in the bath.
Thanks, Al. We'll be all right.
The Great Mantini doesn't need a day job.
Well, what?
It's a pleasure.
So I'm saying it...
He's getting away! He was at my mercy!
Dolt!
I should pass, but I'll trail along--I'll take three.
Well, I helped my hand so I'll have to see you.
And me coming in with two pair--
Hurry up!
Don't get too far!
Seems to be some sort of vaulted chamber up ahead...
What time do you get off?
Yeah.
The design's deliberately noncontextural. But I wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.
And in the material. That's...that's unpolished red granite.
No, but I count them. In a sock isn't new, you know?
Are you taking them still?
I mean, do you need to have surgery on it or what? Because those pills you're taking are for a lot of pain. And you're going through them quick.
I wanted you here so we could have a few months together. Maybe everything happens for a reason. Something bad to force something good.
I still don't know what that means.
The kind where there isn't really an answer.
I don't know what that means. What kind of problem?
Okay.
I do not get cold.
I ve got work tonight, Jane.
You are cold.
I can't be late. I don't know if the radio balloons work above your planet. I don't know if my words went to the ship. If I'm not there, the captain will think I'm dead and go.
I used the last one to jump off the cliff...
Just like any other hard cases. Gotta know how to handle 'em.
Look pretty rough.
What about all these saloons?
Walter, I can't tell you how badly I feel about this. There was no excuse for Hartwell to fly off the handle.
I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused. She has always had a very healthy sense of humor.
I'd really rather not say.
This is a slur on her good name.
No, I don't not love you. I like, I know that we've definitely got something between us. Something good. Something special.
You want to do it?
Well, I feel that...things are getting to that point in a relationship. When two people share...a special moment between them.
I didn't say that. I mean, love, it's like a term that gets thrown around. People say things, they get married, have kids, and then what? It's like they call it off, going "I was wrong."
No, I come to see Doctor.
Don' be facety, woman.
Yes.
Nuthin'.
Mine, too.
Sure.
Goodbye.
I have no idea.
You? Oh no. No. I'll get it.
A kiss for each page.
The price, my coquette, is every bit as firm as I am...
I don't know.
If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked.
Yeah. I know what it's like.
By God, I'll fight the lot of you
He gave it to me.
Where were you the day he died?
That's the last time you rode, isn't it? Do you think it was your fault? Is that why?
No...! But they trained me to. M.K. ULTRA. EX-CATCHER. America works. Get rid of the crazy people, the lone gunmen, and the system still works.
Did he make your life miserable?
How?
Then what happened?
-- And what did Dr. Paley do after you stopped seeing him?
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish a pattern in Dr. Paley's behavior with women.
Why couldn't you stay here with me?
Trask wants to talk with you.
How old are you?
I'm from all over.
Yo, a bad reputation -- Twenty years from now people will say 'D'you remember Marie?' 'No, who was she?' 'She was that little whore who hung out at the Atomic Hoagie Shop.' 'Oh, now I remember!'... See, they don't remember you, they remember the rep.
It's a great song.
The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.
But not even before, when he was living upstairs?
She just wanted to pick up some stuff. No big thing. A relief, actually.
Hi, Marie.
Good morning.
I have no idea.
All right. I'll tell you.
Do you have to be so close-mouthed? I'm your brother. And I'm ridin' with you. Remember?
Maybe at the ranch. Maybe sooner than that.
At the ranch maybe?
Yes.
You must be plenty worried about Lednov sneakin' up on us. Think he will?
It might be a good idea for you to disappear from Casablanca for a while. There's a Free French garrison over at Brazzaville. I could be induced to arrange a passage.
I think perhaps you're right.
Maybe, but it seemed like a good time to start.
Well, Rick, you're not only a sentimentalist, but you've become a patriot.
Uh huh.
Our expenses?
And that ten thousand francs should pay our expenses.
My letter of transit? I could use a trip. But it doesn't make any difference about our bet. You still owe me ten thousand francs.
That rhymes.
I could eat a horse.
How 'bout some Cokes?
Absolutely.
I just dislocated my finger.
It ain't your fault -- I originally done it in the Baby Crenshaw fight. That's me fightin' Big Baby Crenshaw -- Big Baby was the size of an airplane an' I broke my hands on his head -- I lost, but it's a nice picture, don't ya think?
Will you shut up... Just give me a drink.
What did he say?
Twenty-five hours, Eddie. Twenty- five hours you been playin' straight.
Give me a drink, will ya?
You don't need a drink.
It's a lung cancer issue
Number one. She hates smokers
I've retrieved certain pieces of information on Miss Katarina Stratford I think you'll find helpful.
What've you got for me?
Her favorite uncle
Fuck you, Phil.
Come on, Phil. You're not gonna let this slide. What about her parents? What about what else she's published? At least we should get the stuff to see if we find anything else that's an amazing real-life coincidence.
She knew she could beat it. That's why she asked to take it.
Not unless she got up in the ring and turned into one mean sonofabitch.
How did they die? Was there an investigation?
Now I'm late. Bye.
Listen to this --
Not now, Jonah --
Just this one part, okay? "I have been an excellent third-baseman for as long as I or anyone else can remember, and I guarantee you will not get one past me"
I look stupid. I look stupid, don't I? I look like I'm trying too hard. I was going to get a haircut but then I thought I'd look like I just got a haircut.
This is a good letter, Dad.
The heels on these shoes are very large. Why have I never noticed this? The heels on these shoes are grotesque.
Her name is Annie. Annie Reed.
Jonah, I'm leaving --
WAIT!!! -- "and while we're on the subject, let's just say right now that Brooks Robinson was the best third baseman ever. It's important that you agree with me on that because I'm from Baltimore." Dad, she thinks Brooks Robinson is the greatest.
Deeds! Who do you think I'm talking about?
'Sides, car's right outside. I'll be seein' ya, Jer.
I'll save you the trouble. I'm a cab. There. Did it myself.
Can we have it by tonight?
The Wall Street guy? Oh, yeah. I didn't recognize him without his rug.
He got three years and fined fifty million dollars and wrote 'em a fucking check. Like that, fifty mil, signed his name. Whoa-- little help here!
I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer.
No. You drove us here.
Debi's house.
If the incident happened the way you say it did, there hasn't been an infraction.
Mrs. Bledsoe?
Hi. So far so good. So. What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school. Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health. What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
Not without a warrant.
Yeah I know. But I don't have to flatter you. It just feels right. You're the perfect girl for me. As in is, was and always will be. I'm glad dancing was invented. You know the first dances were rituals. Like fertility rites.
Musta been a lesson tellin' ya it was the wrong time... What did you do, your mama find out?
Hey! Who needs physics when we've got chemistry?
You think of the weirdest damn things to say sometimes, peanut. Ain't we been doin' a pretty fair job this far?
Yeah?
It ain't altogether terrible just to let things go along sometimes. Lula, I done a few things in my life I ain't too proud of, but I'll tell ya from now on I ain't gonna do nothin' for no good reason. All I know for sure is there's more'n a few bad ideas runnin' around loose out there.
At Pee Dee, all you think about is the future, you know? Gettin' out? And what you'll do and what you'll think about when you're on the outside again.
Yeah, yeah. Like that. Just like that.
Uh, excuse me, sir, but my friend was the one balling your wife a couple hours ago, and he seems to have left his wallet behind, and we were wondering...
My ankle. Just go explain the situation.
Me?
Hold on.
Fuck you. I'll get it myself.
You know, I don't like to show my body to a man of my gender-
'Cause I don't like to get naked in front of another man, you know-it's, uh...
'cause, uh, you never know what's gonna happen.
I have spoken with your father.
I like her.
Well, he loves the place. It's his home.
Good to meet you. Again.
Thanks.
We're gonna try. Place needs a lot of work.
Black market?
That's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... ...I have a pretty good idea where to find the other. Search him.
Right.
Now it's worse.
Same thing. Ya know, Rock, remember when we was kids, we fought together. An' I wasn't well an' ya had to beat up that Irish kid -- what's his name? -- Gallager -- I bought a suit and became a businessman. You put on gloves. An' I remember Mama almost cried, may she rest in peace -- an' our ol' man who said ya had no brains --I'd like to lay hands on that bastard. You ain't never had any luck. Even when I owned you in '66 you never had luck. But now I think you might be gettin' some luck kid. Whatta you think?
Calm, Dishonorable, Vile Submission! Thou art my souls hate! Tybalt! You ratcatcher, will you walk?
"To seal the wound, he took a poker from the fire --"
How could I ruin myself? What do you mean, ruin myself?
I'm so humiliated. I don't know what to say. I mean--
Well, then a third opinion.
You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody.
They look like acorns.
Good king of cat's, nothing but one of your nine lives.
No, I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
Tommy, gimme a coupla minutes, because I promised Mr. Gazzara I'd let him know tomorrow. See, what I wanna know, Tom, if a buncha individual retail merchants get together, how does it operate? On individual mark- ups? You know what I mean? Say I'm the butcher and Aldo Capelli, he's the dairyman and grocer, so suppose I mark up thirty-five percent, but he works on forty, so...
Almost three.
No gas.
Minneapolis... good.
Yes, Swana.
No way. No thanks. I can't do it --
-- You can and you will, Mr. Carter.
'Yes. You're-you're b-b- beautiful.'
You're like this fly, buzzing buzzing everywhere --
They are now.
I don't wanna see that.
I made a great reporter out of you, Hildy, but you won't be half as good on any other paper, and you know it. You need me and I need you -- and the paper needs both of us.
Why should I? I thought it would be a novelty to have a face around here a man could look at without shuddering.
Well, you practically did! Making goo-goo eyes at me for two years till I broke down. And I still claim I was tight the night I proposed. If you'd been a gentleman you'd have forgotten all about it. But not you!
It would have worked if you'd been satisfied with just being editor and reporter. But no! You had to marry me and spoil everything.
Can't we just sort of keep things status quo?
You mean "goodnight."
There's nothing wrong with you, Lisa. You have the town in the palm of your hand.
Who are you? -- Are we enemies? Why am I on this wall? -- Where's Buttercup? --
We had Miracle Max make a pill to bring you back.
Little more gas. Ease it up. Hold on- minor setback. Now you feel confident, right?
Okay, this is important...
Yeah, a little bit. Listen, this is important. When you feel it start to give, put the clutch in.
Let me explain -- -- No, there is too much. Let me sum up. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 99.
Yeah. Now, when you feel like you're confident,...
If you'll just maybe ease it into second.
I buy companies.
No? Why's that?
I'd say you give a good dollar value.
Do you ever... enjoy it?
Mmm, I could tell.
Thank you very much.
We have to go.
Okay... thanks...
Everywhere! Ow!
Lula, darlin'... Makes no difference anyway... We're outta here.
Hey look-
He's just a regular guy't needs help, honey. Look at him.
I was hoping for the real thing.
I never had good footwork.
A little.
How about that prick! He told me he wasn't officer material because he grew up poor like me.
That isn't true, is it?
Naw.
What's the matter, Sweet Pea. Foley finally starting to get to you?
Yeah.
Thinking there's someone who looks like you, walking around the street somewhere. Wonder if I saw him I'd think it was you?
I think you do, yes.
Because pasta should be eaten "Al Dente". So the trinket will just have to wait a bit.
Is the bill ready -- the lady's too?
Eh, no.
What?
Yeah.
I haven't been in news that long. I've just been looking for the right person to talk to. I have about two thousand questions for you.
Totally understood. Totally wrong of me to talk shop after the day you've had. Totally sorry.
NO, I GOT HIM. I CAN TAKE HIM.
Geller...you wanna be a reporter? Take a look at what sells! Sex scandals. Bribery. People jumping off buildings. So unless a kid just killed himself because he was being paid to have sex with the school mascot in a big vat of this cole slaw, you got nothing!
And you're leading with the terrible truth about cole slaw?!
I'm all ears.
That's easy for you to say - you're already dead.
Mr. Bringsly, I'm sorry. I have absolutely no idea what to say to you.
Four.
That seems like a lot of speed for a little pooch -- you sure it won't kill him?
Fucking sickening.
How many is that?
That stalkin' son-of-a-bitch!
What about you, Mare? How the hell'd you manage to stay single?
He's with the hotel. I called him.
I never said that.
Did you have family there--? A sister? In Cody?
Adopted. I should have know. Of course. If it was a snake, it'd bit me!
Who does? It's a crazy mixed-up world. Just do the best you can with what you have...
Let her out. In my custody.
She can take you as far as Florence.
I just saw a man walk out of your room!
I've never seen a lobster.
I've never seen the ocean, either.
Well, picking them is! It's about as exciting as... walking!
Wait a minute!--They're dancing in the palm court--
Woah, watch it!
Uh oh...
...I dropped it.
It was an accident, I'll get you a new one.
Where are you going???
She's a mermaid, dude.
Yeah -- hey, did you see The Little Mermaid on TV the other night? That Ariel, whew.
It's a big, thick envelope, Vicky. You got in.
"Dear Ms. Hughes. We're sorry, but after keeping you on the wait list for the past couple months, we've decided you are now rejected. Enclosed is a 100-page, full-color brochure on how rejected you are."
You got in.
Illegal channels? Shit, if there's any channel that should be illegal, it's whatever that women's channel is. Lifetime Supply of Pantyhose, or some shit.
He served his time for what he did. Another thing... If Lula went with him of her own volition - willingly, that is - there ain't much can be done about it.
You have such a pretty, long neck, like a swan.
In a fire, as I recall.
Yeah, that would be a good move.
You know, you could work in a wine store.
Want some?
Are you chewing gum?
It's not even a mile.
I thought you said it was close. Now I'm all pitted out.
You can't just break into Langdon Carmichael's house. This man has done nothing.
O.K...let me explain this one more time...The Holly Grail is in -....
All right! Listen - please...don't start drooling or...rolling your eyes when I tell you this but - You shouldn't do this..There is no Holy Grail.
Of course there is, Jack. What do you think the Crusades were - a frat initiation? I don't think so...There has to be a Grail.
Well what am I gonna do with it?
I don't know. But I gave it to you...to help YOU...not him.
You really want to help me?
Pretty impressive huh?...Don't let it scare you. I'll admit it's formidable but everything has it's weakness.
Look, you're only sort of insane, really. People like you can lead semi-normal lives. You could get a job...
I don't need a job. I have a quest.
I don't have any business here. I came here for you, I didn't have any business.
How many times have you been on an airplane?
For what?
You don't want my autograph.
I'm sorry ...
-- Sacha, call a cab.
Yes, I heard, and it's not a problem.
Yonelle. Looks like someone raped her, shot her, then threw her out the window. Fuckin' animals.
What kinda music do you like?
When this boat finally reaches Jakata, I'll be first off. You'll never see me again ... and believe me - that day cannot come soon enough. I've got no problem with you ignoring me for the rest of the voyage.
Shall I show you the nursery? It's far away from the rest of the house. If you have children--Oh I hate the word!--or if you decide to adopt one--they can carry on and you'll never even notice. In fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.
Children? Well, we really don't encourage them. They're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?
Of course. Drown them like puppies.
What?
There's only one key.
I know what you mean.
You bet.
You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess.
I do?
Me too.
I'll be home in a little while, Harry. Don't wait up.
Go on home, folks. And thanks for the welcome.
I did? Huh!
Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too. Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil tongue in your head.
Orvolle. His wine. From now on, nothing but water at every meal --
-- water! --
-- and your meat shall be de-boned.
WHY THIS SUDDEN TORTURE?
Because your writing continues, unchecked.
I DIDN'T CREATE THIS WORLD OF OURS! I ONLY RECORD IT!
Its horrors, perhaps! Its darkest nightmares! And to what end? Nothing but your own morbid gratification --
Morbid gratification? NO! I write what I've seen; the endless procession to the chopping block. We're all lined up at the guillotine, waiting for the crunch of the blade. Rivers of blood are flowing beneath our feet, Abbe.
What's its value today?
Do you mind if I sit down? What about the blue one?
I'm afraid it is important.
How much is it worth?
They're all over us!
Light him.
...and I thought I'd come in and...and we could replay, uh, the whole, uh...
Tempus fugit!
En arte voluptus. Que les bons temps roul !
What doesn't?
Thinking about Thorwald?
This is what money looks like. It comes like this, in coin, or like this in paper. Or you can have an "investment." These are stock "certificates" that we bought in your name. Of course, they're worthless now, but at one time they were quite valuable.
They're pretty. Can I have them?
Sure. Now, let's move on to our French exam.
Latin exam, Dad. It's Tuesday.
You're right! It's Tuesday already! By gosh, time flies, doesn't it?!
Gosh, you look pretty tonight.
Huh? Oh. They said I was crazy. Said I wanted to run it like a grocery store.
Do you always wear your hair like that?
I don't want to stay here.
I'm so hungry I could faint. I've -- I've gotten your suit all wet.
Oh sure, Fred.
They're Amish.
That's all right -- it's a drip-dry.
Has his friend appeared to him again?
Peter, you've got to promise me something. Promise you'll never lie the way Charles did. Why do people have to tell lies?
Usually it's because they want something -- and they're afraid the truth won't get it for them.
-- maybe you could, on your way, you know, pick up Jackie here.
Hey, don't thank me. Somebody up there likes you.
Thanks again for everything.
Look, Snoop, I don't know what Glenn promised you or what you think you're gonna get, but the deal is me and Buddy get half of whatever we take from Ripley, understand? How you and Glenn cut up the rest is up to you.
Learning about Cuba. Having some food.
Mr. Spicoli, you're on dangerous ground here. You're causing a major disturbance in my class and on my time.
Everybody who can hurt me, everybody who can help me. It pays.
You know everybody, don't you?
Ahh, slow... Why the open hand bridge? Something wrong with your hand?
Hi. How's business?
Oh. You seem to do all right that way.
Yeah. Had a little accident. A place called Arthur's.
What happened? Somebody step on your hands?
I'd say my game is about twenty per cent off. Maybe more.
Man named Turk Baker?
Yeah. Big creep. Broke my thumbs.
Thanks.
What?
Annette! Annette!
Do you know where she is?
Are you telling me Friedman didn t tell you I was here looking for him?
Why did you kill him?
Those aren't the facts that matter.
Is this where we're going?
I wonder if they've -- I don't want to hear anything about it.
How long has it been -- a month?
You know I liked it better long.
It's on the way. I see you went ahead and cut your hair.
Hong Kong midnight, happy new year. Except at China Bank.
Don't panic, now, there's no rush...
Relax, don't jam it...
I missed you, Fran.
George, was it a nice wedding? Gosh, I wanted to be there.
Jed is having a slumber party New Year's Eve and he invited me.
Fine. Fine.
I forgot to mention. Jed called --
Just out of curiosity, do you have any friends whose names don't begin with a J? I feel like it was a failure of the imagination on our part naming you Jonah. What is marjoram? Does anyone know?
P. Dad?
What?
I got a big score lined up up north. They wouldn't even know about it, it wasn't for me. I could do it right now myself, except it's so fucking cold up there in January--
Does red pepper go under R or P?
So I can go.
Sure. Looking good.
My orders came through. My squadron ships out tomorrow. I'll be leading a very important mission.
I saw your daughter. She's beautiful! Who knows how many Salvatores must be running after her...
Alfredo died. Do you remember him?
Sure, sure! Boccia... What's he do?
No. And I'm not married. Are you happy?
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
I'm sure that's the explanation.
He won't do it.
He won't.
We want to talk freely.
What for?
Should I come back in five minutes?
Well, then stuff cotton in your ears, because come six o'clock we're gonna walk into that dining room with smiles on. Understand, little brother?
What's the matter with you? So the piano's a little out of tune. So what?
All right, I'm a child. Have it any way you want. But I'm going back to my own apartment, where I should have lived in the first place. But no, I got to listen to you and move here. All right. If you want to live with me, Anne, okay. But the sign outside will say "Mr. Stew Smith" and you'll have to be "Mrs. Stew Smith" or there's nothing doing. No more Anne Schuyler's husband He has his bag all packed by this time. He snaps it shut viciously, lifts it off the chair, picks up his hat, and notices Mrs. Schuyler staring open-mouthed at him. and here's some more news for you. You can take your red room, your green room, your left wing and your right wing, and you know what you can do with them! Come on, Gallagher.
Fine! I don't blame her. I know I'm out of my own crowd. I should have had better sense in the beginning. But I'll stay in my own backyard from now on.
You've done nothing but watch me - watch me! - ever since I've been here. Treated me like a thug, watched me like a hawk, mistrusted me. Every time I leave the house, that Jane goes out and counts the silverware.
Joan of Arc! What's it to you?
You're getting cold feet about this.
First girl I ever knew. Who lets me give her a bath.
I don't know ... She had gum on her lip, for Christ sake. I don't think she's right for the act.
What's there to talk about? She can sing. That puts her at the head of the class. That makes her the only one in the class.
I just thought we should talk about it. Between ourselves.
Okay, okay. I'll call the girl.
How many other silent partners are there, Frank? Donna? Little Cindy? Hell, let's give Eddie a vote.
Ma? Ma? Was Ma there the last time we played the Ambassador? Oh, that's right, she was on bass. How could I forget.
You were looking for me, weren't you?
They saw where I jumped! I didn't chicken! What do I have to do-- kill myself?
I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so.
No, tell me.
Thanks. I'll be there. About seven-thirty?
What?
I'm glad you do.
How's the clock, Bandit II.
Ticking away, but it looks like a clear shot to Hot Town. Green lights and white lines all the way.
They're trying to intimidate us. Tell them to wait in the conference room.
But you'll do it?
Lula, you there?
Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
How do you know Annie?
It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
So you came up to see Annie, huh?
I don't know.
Frost?
It's pretty.
Cheers.
I'm fine.
Agnostics don't believe or disbelieve, Ma. We just don't pretend we know.
Yes...You-you re not going to take Shiva away?
Yeah, I felt that way, too, when I first started, but now... the hours, the repetition... it's not all glamour and mall openings anymore. Maybe I should've listened to my people and tried to make the crossover to nights earlier, I don't know... ...I just hope it's not too late for me. God! Listen to me, "Me, me, me." It's so easy to get caught up in the whole ego cycle of this business and make it all about yourself. Stop, right? That's it, no more about me tonight, I promise... Let's talk about you... what do you think about me? I'm kidding... Seriously, Betty, I'm doing all the talking here...
My sister... She lives in the next valley.
Is she on the phone?
I've never met anyone like you, Betty.
No, I mean your dedication scares me...
Well, first I thought Patina, and then the Ivy, but then I thought of somewhere a little more romantic. Like my place.
Didn't I?
How many?
How will he eat?
Isn't there something you can give him? A pill or something?
Isn't she attractive?
No bones?
Huh!
I was misinformed.
Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
It was a combination of all three.
The clipper to America.
Why? What's in Lisbon?
What make ye of that, Jack?
It bodes evil.
God's blessing.
There's the way, mates.
Going grows slower... we've not made... half a mile in two hours...
... this rate... we'll all be in our graves... 'fore we reach the Baron's fortress...
I'll be right back.
N-n-no, not that.
Like--
Hi. You have hard shells, right?
-- Gimme a twenty, pardner.
Yeah, it's tough when your cheek- bones are your main asset.
Mississippi's the other way!
People say that?
Damn right! That's what I tell them when people say you've turned into a fish.
Don't be a c-a-t.
The sound of love.
Would you quiet down! Just for a minute?
You took the Rembrandt, I figured it was a fair trade.
What about the rules?
I'd taken the Mask?
Elaine, I've got to talk to you.
Murder!
Shit. I feel sick.
Don't worry. In a few seconds you won't feel a thing.
Okay. Listen, I cancelled the tickets for Fabian. I thought it would be better for your birthday to eat at a nice restaurant, Chez Tres.
He's why I watch Jerry. Jerry's the bait for Jonas.
Jonas builds assassins for a living. Several of whom may be in place already. We'd like to kill a few birds with one stone.
No idea. Honest. What are you going to do?
Don't go home. And don't go to work. Either one could be bad.
Well -- this would be goodnight.
Right. I'll come in.
Oh hell yes.
She's got a juvenile record from New Orleans. Parents died when she was 13.
Parents died?
It's okay, Quince. I understand. You've always meant well and I appreciate that. Sometimes things just turn out -- wrong.
So have we!
What's the dope, Sheriff?
Who engineered this getaway?
I know what it means.
You pickin' nothin' but cider apples, Peaches--I hope you understand that.
Yeah, great....Dobchay! It will dry, yes?
What have you two been doin' to make it look so nice?
It's perfect, you've done a great job.
Own the desert.
What do we find in the desert? Arrow heads, spears. In a war, if you own the desert, you own North Africa.
The sight of you makes flowers seem like dross. All the heavenly angels must envy your grace.
Dear lad, what does winter bespeak but death? It is a time of mourning. This calamity is a curse. Something wondrous and beautiful has been taken from the world.
Aye. And it is the trouble befallen us that brings me here. I entreat you to tell me the cause of our surrounding sorrow, most lovely of the lovely.
A unicorn's been slain. The last stallion in all the country.
Perfectly certain, because I shall make him tremble.
I risk nothing, for I am certain to kill him.
Certain?
Where is he?
He's a good pilot.
Me?
She bought it.
Yes!
Hey, how ya feelin', Mickey?
...What?
I said, how ya feelin'?
Do you see me talkin'? Huh?
Yeah.
Dipper needed it.
Let me do the talking.
Any more MiGs?
Three guesses.
Hey, no kidding? Where are your offices?
Same here.
Harvard?
You bet.
Yes yes, I did get my degree up there.
Did you study under Kim Greene?
Oh no, Amy, pardon me for saying so but I find that very farfetched.
I wanna talk to you about a job.
Will you ask Her Majesty to be patient?!
Who gave it to you?
Yes. I know all they know about the murder. And I'm a great hero. The Tribune said I was shot twice.
Tell you what I'll do. I'll toss you for her--heads she plays with me.
O.K. Heads you win.
That's too bad.
I'm O.K. It didn't hurt much.
I'm sorry to hear that.
What else could I do?
Why not?
No, no - it's true, all right, only we didn't want to get it in print yet, that's all.
What do I care about your mother- in-law! You're still working for this paper, aren't you! Or are you?
Well, you see, I've acquired one of those new mother-in-laws, and we were afraid she wouldn't understand the whole idea. So we were going to wait till she went to Europe.
Not on my own beat, no.
You wouldn't know news if you fell into a mess of it, nose first. So you're the bright lad that's never been scooped!
I've heard of people being scooped on their own funerals, but this! Holy mackerel! Why, it's news when Anne Schuyler gets her fingernails manicured, but this! She gets married to one of our own reporters and the Tribune beat us to it! Well! What do you guys want? Go on, get back to your desks. Go back to your work. Now don't tell me you were drunk at the time and don't remember! Or is this one of Bingy's snow-storms?
No? Well, where were you when that happened?
Well, it's your business to get news! And here you had a story right in your own lap and you let the Tribune scoop us on it. Making a first class Grade A monkey out of me. If it ever happens again - just don't bother about coming back. That's all.
Yes, sir.
I'm not saying it's a bad thing, in fact, I think it's something we should take pride in. I'm going to give the last brownie as a prize to the saddest act here.
You are a gentleman.
Don't.
Hey, I just want to know where I stand. What chance --
I dive in search of God. If I go deep enough I'm going to find him.
No. Jacques is a creature of the sea. He isn't meant to live on earth, among us... You should know this, Johana.
You really think so? Did you tell him you were pregnant?
You told Bonita, but you didn't tell him, right?
No, I'm look --
Mandatory retirement upon our Chairman's sixty-fifth birthday.
I'm all finished. Now what?
Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? It means he might live. Even if it's only a remote possibility.
So we have a chance of getting back together again.
Income tax evasion?
Where does that leave us?
The Vice-President...
Oh... right... You know, ever since the stroke...
Who?
It's all right with us --
That's a crock! If one of us did that he wouldn't hang around here waiting for the other two to wise up.
But he'd have to. If he left he'd be admitting his guilt -- and the others would know what happened. Whoever it is has to wait here, pretending to look for the money, waiting for the rest of us to give up and go home. That's when he'll be safe and not a minute before.
Not my room!
Sissy. You're trying to protect those scuzzy bitches. Well, let your conscience be your guide, as my mommy used to say, but it won't work. Those stinking sluts are going to suffer...
Sissy, don't play dumb with me! You're a good model but a shitty actress. The cowgirls are involved in this whooping crane disappearance. You know perfectly well they are. Last seen in Nebraska. Didn't make it to Canada. Siwash Lake is between Nebraska and Canada. The cowgirls have possession of Siwash Lake. And who else but Jellybean's wild cunts could possibly conceive of doing something so diabolical as to tamper with the last flock of some nearly extinct birds? How much do you know about it? Have they murdered those cranes the way they murdered my moo cows?
Ha ha ho ho and hee hee.
I'm not leaving without that tape.
And?
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
Did you read the latest draft, by the way?
Sure is tasty.
There is no new ending. Page 750 on is exactly the same.
Oh yeah. Much better.
How about the new ending? Did you like that?
I liked it a lot. A lot of improvements. It just seemed overall, I don't know, tighter, more... congealed or something.
It's Christine. Hey you.
How about Italy?
I didn't know that.
On the other hand, Winston Churchill drank a bottle of cognac a day and lived until he was ninety-one.
From the air?
But what?
Yeah, I give a shit.
See. There. What'd I tell you?
The vodka. What'd I tell you?
Cirrhosis of the liver is the fifth leading killer of adult Western males.
This one.
That wasn't the deal.
And--
I lost my wallet.
I can't imagine who did it. I can't think of any enemies I have.
That's right here. Gee, it was lucky your telling me about that old newspaper superstition.
For a minute, I thought maybe Walter Burns was at the back of it. But then I realized he couldn't have been.
Freezing. But I'm getting warmer.
Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
If you won't be true to your word, then you've left me no choice.
What the devil --
Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
It's great. I swea-- I'm-- I'm, tch, I'm speechless. I was...I was not in the mood to listen to this thing now. I don't know what to say. I'm moved and I laughed and I-- Uh, I, you know, I was on the edge of my seat. I just think it's wonderful! I'm, I'm totally...stunned. This is not an insult. I'm amazed that you can... It was-- I just thought it was great.
Okay. How'd yours go?
Acquired?
I guess in case one year they're not.
Every year.
Did you see the van back there?
Never mind. You'd think I was making it up.
So to speak.
Just taking your photo.
Excellent.
One baked -- one fries.
Okay.
Can we order first?
Hookers beat you up?
I didn't know you were into that.
I was dreaming about you. How beautiful you were!
I was!
How come you don't hate their guts?
Oh yeah?
I don't know what happened.
That's not true.
Look, he's in pretty good shape.
Maggie!
The "man" again.
Anyway, that's why I came by. I need to fix this button. Do you have a needle and thread?
You're forgetting you're married.
Better go back to your bed.
On your piano, that is the swap.
You said it would be easy!
I told you I've never driven before!
I like it.
Is this your house?
Next game, ten bucks.
You know what I mean. You couldn't make that shot again in a million years.
Luck! Whaddya mean, luck?
You ought to take up crap shooting. Talk about luck!
Why?
I couldn't, huh? Okay. Go ahead. Set 'em up the way they were before.
I'll meet you there.
Chasing me - animals - horrible -
Precinct Six. I sent a friend over with bail money.
Now look. Let's focus. Prom theme. We need a new idea.
Yeah, I'm going to take a shower and I'll meet you downstairs.
Morning honey.
Oh . . . yeah, yeah. That's all right.
So that's what this is all about. We'll get together and plan your curriculum.
Instead of Friday -- could you possibly switch to Thursday? You'd be doing me a great favor --
Hello? Yeah, Baxter. What's up?
Well -- it's all right with me, Bud. Let me check. I'll get back to you.
Okay, okay. Look, Sylvia -- instead of Friday - could we make it Thursday night?
Bob WHO? -- all right, so we'll watch it at the apartment. Big deal. Baxter? It's okay for Thursday.
Latest casualty? Ernest Harriman. You heard of him?
What are you thinking?
Now? We just --
Slim Jim? Apple? Yogurt? You like yogurt.
That are called Rommel or something, I guess not that many.
There's still something going on inside of him I can't reach. So me and Smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. Okay?
I love you, too, good-night, or good- morning .
You're imagining it.
Should I?
These attacks... it's got something to do with her... uh... pancreas.
She's got a...
Yeah, I think so.
Nice try. Everyone thinks I did.
My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
I thought you...
Yeah. Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact.
I wish you were coming with me.
I don't know. I guess... it just seems that women today are more impressed by the mighty buck than by some schmo who spent the last seventeen years scraping by on Peace Corp wages.
Why didn't you just tell her the truth?
Dumbshit.
Oh yeah.
Ahh.
But Jesus, Pat, if she's as special as you say, she's going to want to hear about the things you did.
I wondered who'd been giving me a bad name.
I figured the worst they'd do is work him over a little.
I don't know, I'm waiting for the transcript.
Well, the trial's in two weeks, but I think they've already sentenced me. They just need to check if Siberia can slot me in.
Now you're using that word.
You know, there is one thing I can't figure out. All along they've been bugging me about those files and when I told them I'd burned all that stuff, they went nuts - they told the Consul guy they were medical records?
Well, it seems they've dropped any charge relating to the files.
It's more or less how it sounds. Sometimes it's not pretty to watch. Some horses fight it real hard. Your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. So if you don't want to watch, I'll call you when it's done.
Hi there. Here, take a look.
Hi.
Both.
This isn't right.
Positive saliva match. The cup was definitely used since the original sweep.
Give him the card.
May I...?
Good afternoon, Mrs...?
I hope it s not too significant.
Don't bother asking, we already tried.
I've already introduced Mr. Black to you all.
Bontecou wants a speedier response than that.
Are you running this Board or am I?
Certainly, Bill.
Yes, you are to understand that, and now may I ask you a question?
You're a sentimental man.
A practical man, sir. Given the Marquis' unusual tastes, a sound thrashing on bare flesh may not qualify as a deterrent.
On the contrary. Let me take up this matter with the Marquis myself --
Because he knew I couldn't leave the case alone. And this way at least he'd keep track of it. And me.
Bree --
No hurry. Would you like some breakfast?
No, none for me. Come on, let's play.
Is that the only way you can succeed, Anton, to see me fail?
Yeah. A glorified doormat.
Oh, it'll do in a pinch.
Are you coming home?
Hi.
Shit!
Yeah but more than that. I'm happy because I'm proud of us. Because although our talents are small and peculiar, we use them to their best advantage.
Well we rang 900 today.
What am I missing? What do you have to be happy about?
My house?
Whatever the hell it is you're standin' there waitin' to say.
You got it, Sweet Pea. Nice boonies, Seeger.
Say it
The situation is, my man Cameron here has a major jones for Bianca Stratford.
What is it with this chick? She have three tits?
Good morning, girls.
What plan?
I think I speak correctly when I say that Cameron's love is pure. Purer than say -- Joey Dorsey's.
Dorsey can plow whoever he wants. I'm just in this for the cash.
I didn't murder anybody
I do.
What's that got to do with you?
Well, then it all seems to be working out for you. Listen, Ms...?
I seem to be in trouble, Beefy.
The world would be so much simpler if it were all just about good and evil. Unfortunately I find it much more slippery and elusive place.
The shit has hit the fan, kid. Take a look.
Great evening, isn't it?
There's something about the spring that's just cool. Like the smell of fresh rain or something.
Suck me...beautiful?
Uh...you know, my friends call me Nova -- as in Casanova.
I am shocked, shocked to find that gambling is going on in here!
How can you close me up? On what grounds?
Find one.
But I have no excuse to close it.
Yes, much too good a time. The place is to be closed.
Mademoiselle, after this disturbance it is not safe for Laszlo to stay in Casablanca.
Yeah, really!
Really?
Sure... .
Drink up, Charley. We're ahead of you.
After what we been hearing about your brother, I thought your throat'd be kind of dry.
I'm not thirsty.
Thanks for the legal advice, Charley. That's what we always kept you around for. Now how do we keep him from giving this testimony? Isn't that the er as you put it main order of business?
So they're walking along and smiling. That doesn't mean he's going to talk. There's no evidence until he gives public testimony.
How 'bout it, Eve? Can he skate around your block?
Let me show you the entire trousseau!
Well, what do you think?
The recovery? Oh , yeah! Hey, they rebuilt the freeway in six months.
Amazing. I'm very impressed.
It makes you look like an angel.
Listen, I wanna say hi to my girlfriend -- Yo, Adrian!
Okay!
Maybe. You want to play?
Ten grand. I'm gonna win ten grand in one night. ...Well, who's gonna beat me? C'mon, Charlie, who's gonna beat me?
Okay... Okay. Nobody can beat you.
Ten grand! I mean, what other poolroom is there in the country where a guy can walk out with ten grand in one night? Jeez, you know, I can remember hustling an old man for a dime a game.
Very realistic.
Mom, come out!
Yeah, I know. But never to exist again!
Well, it certainly doesn't look promising.
That thought doesn't terrify you?
I don't understand. Aren't you frightened?
You can't.
Nerves.
There must be some way.
Oh my God! You're at Southglen South? They have a killer baseball team.
I'm not in trouble.
That's right--that sounds like trouble to me.
Little known fact.
Look, don't you wanna show them - Gus, Billy Prince, yourself--that you're not freaked out by the cool kids anymore? That you can go in there, be friends with them, and get your story?
That's all I wanted to know!
Plus, if you quit you're no better than me.
No ! I don't want to know him! He's doing missionary work--in India ! I wrote him weeks ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. Maybe he got killed in the war!
I don't think the color of the interior is....
Which lawyer?
For ourselves... we are much happier now since we moved to a little room next to the servants' quarters.
We had to take it on account of the safe.
We did our best, Comrade.
A day.
A cow?
You have the keys.
What?
She called Maya, who's not working tonight, so we're all going out.
Sorry.
You're forgiven if you don't make dates with anybody except me for the rest of the voyage.
Hello, Beautiful.
I have no idea what to say. How to act. What if I do the wrong thing?
I'm so sorry. I'm a coward --
Well - empires have fallen because of trashy romances...
Who's the guy, George's boyfriend?
What do you mean, I wasn't there? I remember distinctly . . .
Yeah, yeah, I know. You told me that. What else are you? What . . . are you a hypnotist?
You see, George, you were not there to stop Gower from putting that poison into the . . .
Don't you understand, George? It's because you were not born.
Then if I wasn't born, who am I?
No, of course not.
Well then, why am I seeing all these strange things?
You're nobody. You have no identity.
What do you mean, no identity? My name's George Bailey.
No -- I must find it -- Fourteen thousand two hundred marks.
Good morning, Drew. Thanks for coming out.
Nothing is real until it's perceived.
How?
Take off your hat.
Where did you learn how to do that?
Yessir.
It's only grief makes her like she is.
Tell me some bad news?
That bad?
Alright, I'll see to it and things'll be just as they were, okay?
Chris! Tell me some good news.
So I hear.
But why must you indulge in his pornography?
You'd suffer in her stead?
If only blood will appease you, then shed mine.
Not now, or we're both done for.
You're dismissed.
A right good marks-man! And she's fair I love.
We didn t quite make it as lovers... Leon is a good man, though...
Shut up!
What are you going to do now? Call the police? Take him away? I must warn you he s terrified of men, so...
You like a little coffee with your cream and sugar?
I'm not satisfied till the spoon stands straight up.
Will you just relax, mon? He's not gonna kill us. My father is a television repairman. He's got all kinds of tools. I can fix-this car.
Make up your mind. Is he gonna shit, or is he gonna kill us?
It wouldn't kill you to talk about something other than yourself and your own fucking job once in a while --
What changed?
Before you ask there's nothing new on the coke.
You've got to get me something I can use, Charlie.
I'm trying.
So she's honest.
You're right, but it's funny. All my life I thought I was simply a man who didn't believe in any of it.
I don't care what you say! In Constantinople at least you have streets, sultans, pashas--
Sensitive -- what is that?
I thought Latisha said you would --
Whatever you say, Rat.
Thanks.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!
Yes.
You got a real friend here, kid. Don't forget it.
Thanks, Johnny... .
Something he said, just before...
's all right, kid. I took care of 'em myself this morning.
Get back to the horses. They're straggling.
Okay. A-B-C -- D-E-F -- G-H-I --
Are the horses stragglin' or aren't they?
Yeah. While the horses wander all over the country.
His letters will keep.
He spoke to you?
I went to Sophie's and she was very hospitable.
Thanks.
I know first aid!
Eve, if you'll let me, I can --
You still don't see it, do you, Charlie? You are nothing but a small- time Charlie. You'd love to keep me hustling for you, huh? Wouldn't ya? I mean, a couple more years with me, scuffling around them little towns and those back alleys. You might make yourself enough to get a little poolroom back in Oakland. Six tables and a handbook on the side. Is that when you say goodbye to me, Charlie?
Is that what you think?
Yeah, that's what I think.
All right. That's what I want. Poolroom with a little handbook on the side. Getting old.
Lay down and die by yourself. Don't take me with you.
Yeah. Just like that.
Maximum intensity. Yeah. I can't wait to get out of here. I'm gonna write. I'm gonna check out of this bourgeois motel. Push myself away from the dinner table and say 'No more Jell O for me, Mom.'
What is this insolence?
Do you think you have free license to be insulting? Believe me you have not. You think you're superior, but you're quite an ordinary man.
Well now, Miss Flaemm, we can talk.
Some champagne, Miss Flaemm?
You may go, Mr. Kringelein.
Does the world belong to you, Mr. Preysing?
For the first time in my life, I'm happy.
Paul?
Christ.
Kind of isolated.
Don't it matter none he's makin' ya out a fool? -- I'd break his lips.
Why?
He's takin' cheap shots.
It don't matter.
Loretta.
Ahh, maybe next summer.
Yeah, like a church. Church of the Good Hustler.
Seen any signs of it, Bill?
Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
What?
What happened? What happened?
Not that way! Through the door!
I guess part of us never really leaves high school.
Just like this.
... of you. You'll all end up like this.
She's a Commie pig. We're going to nail every last one...
Harold, calm down! This is...
Stay where you are, Harold .
She took my head.
How do you know?
Ernie, I'm a rich tourist today. How about driving me home in style?
Oh -- yes. Wood?
What?
Okay.
Wood or wire? They have both.
Who and what is a Drexl?
That dazzling imagination.
A real live pimp?
You have a pimp?
Is he black?
I want this box rigged with a beacon!
Do what you have to do. I don't take it personally.
Yeah. But just how're we goin' to make out? I got to get me a job.
Ain't got time.
What are you thinking?
...When I got outta the army, Clara, I was lost. I didn't know what I wanted to do. I was twenny-five years old, what was I gonna do, go back to my old job, forty cents an hour. I thought maybe I go to college under the G.I. Biller Rights, you know? But I wouldn't graduate till I was twenny-eight, twenny-nine years old, even if I made it in three years. And my brother Freddie wanted to get married, and I had three unmarried sisters -- in an Italian home, that's a terrible thing. And my kid brother Nickie, he's a one got married last week. So I just went to pieces. I used to walk inna streets till three, four o'clock inna mornings. My mother used to be so worried about me. My uncle Mario come over one time. He offered me a job driving his hack onna night shift. He got his own cab, you know. And God forgive me for what I'm gonna say now, but I used to thinka doing away with myself. I used to stand sometimes in the subway, and God forgive me what I'm going to say, I used to feel the tracks sucking me down under the wheels.
Nothin'.
NO!!!
Do you like to read?
Chill. We don't want your face coming off with it.
The job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. She couldn't have lived with it. I know that now.
No, it's for the best, it really is. We were so wrong for each other.
Oh, did he? What did he say?
No. It's okay.
Boy, I bet you'd go to a hanging.
My personality's showing again. Should I leave?
How'd you get here?
I hitched.
You didn't miss much. Rob and Carrie say hello.
Go back to sleep.
So you don't mind?
How come?
Sure Witt! Now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature.
Cash.
Thanks.
Please check. Is it full? Please could you check.
Is the flight full?
Right.
And I love what you're wearin'.
You're the worst driver I've ever seen in my life... that's including any place... the worst... Europe, United... any place... Asia.
Well, thanks, thank you. You-you're a wonderful tennis player.
You want your gear? Here you go.
Who? Grammy? Grammy Hall?
I mean... "Ants." "I've got a problem with ants."
So. Is it different to how you imagined it?
I just can't find a nest. The root of the problem. I've looked everywhere. What's the Russian for ant? Sorry that's a stupid... Sorry. This is strange isn't it.
I'm pretty nervous. Are you?
I bet. What about me? Am I how you imagined?
Back east in Newport, Rhode Island, they call 'em the Fall River Debs. In Pensacola, the Mobile Debs. In Norfolk --
You wouldn't like what you'd see. You don't know me anymore. I don't know me anymore.
Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
Not an easy day to forget.
-- It was "La Belle Aurore."
So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
Done like a champion. Can you reach me with the line?
You were right about coming here. I'm sorry for not thinking...
From the parapets most likely. The men are amused by a battlefield entertainment of my own contriving.
Please -- not now.
Why is that impossible?
I --
You, maybe you're the company's biggest moron. We can't use Morris, he's been with us too long, he's a nice guy, too many friends. Matter of fact, why don't you fire him. No -- scratch that; I'll fire him. ...Make it fast, make it fast.
Tell him I'll be right there... Well, what is it?
I --
...Who let you in?
You --
You don't seem all that scared.
These girls are high schoolers? Damn, we've got some underage hotties on our hands, here!
Jesus, you sound like my ex-wife.
We still talk, though.
Ada says you're doing well with the piano?
I will follow you.
Get married all you want to, Hildy, but you can't quit the newspaper business.
Great grief! What's that other paper going to give you?
Oh! In that case, the raise is off and you go back to your old salary and like it. Trying to blackjack --
Who says I can't? You're a newspaper man.
Oh. Right.
Are you sure you...?
-- yeah?
C'mon, Jackie, I'm only trying -- George --
-- do me a favor, kind of keep your eye on Jackie, she's a little high strung tonight --
Orleans has held out for six months. I don't suppose a few days will make much difference. Take some rest.
Yeah.
Oh... Hi.
I just wanna deal with the boss, ok?
No Marshal, you don't understand. I'm through with lawing, I'm Through with the whole Proposition. Forever. I did my Duty, now I'd like to get on with My life. That is if you don't Mind. Jesus. Good day now.
Hey, cabs are expensive. I'm cheap, remember?
You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture. You crossed the line, man.
I heard you.
Pretty good for a one-armed nigger, huh?
Okay, boy, beat it.
It was laziness1 my whole breakup with Avery. You know that thing you say, "it's nobody's fault." It's one of the great lies, right? Someone is always to blame -- if you go for it, go for it like you do a job, work at it --
What d'you want anyhow? What you come and bother me for?
Look, I'm kind of in a hurry.
Oh. Hi.
I don't know. Maybe because he fears death.
You betcha!
Hello.
Who was that?
Well. There's the Bible story. God took a rib from Adam and made Eve. Maybe men chase women to get the rib back. When God took the rib, he left a hole there, place where there used to be something. and the women have that. Maybe a man isn't complete as a man without a woman.
The breath had almost totally left her body. She was as white as snow. And then she completely pulled back from death and stood up and put on her clothes and began to cook for everyone in the house. The mourners. And me. And herself! She ate a meal that would choke a pig!
Yes.
Mmm. An editor.
There's a car following us. Probably another one flanking us the next street over.
It would be a lot easier for me to show you instead of tell you. But first things first.
I'm not happy.
He didn't.
And they want me to make up for it.
Tell them that's impossible. I need my normal lead time.
Takes me back.
Don't worry about Dr. Dreyfuss -- I happen to know he was out on a case.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lieberman -- and I'll never invite those people again.
It's a thought.
Don't be too smart, Jimmy--you're out in the rough yourself. You had an argument with Lother a couple of hours before he was killed--but I'll deal with that later--
Great. You look great. You both do.
Okay.
Whaddya want to know? My sign?
Yes, Mr. Brett--right away.
Okay.
For a very excellent reason from your own admission-- --I'm not saying you did--but I think you know more than you're telling. Years of experience have taught me to mistrust circumstantial evidence. Nevertheless, in your case there's plenty of it.
Some girl that's been hanging on at every party. now I'm supposed to be her baby's Daddy. Anyway, I told your mom I wanted to be the one who told you.
Kelvin, if you see anything unusual...
I can't talk just now. I'm too tired.
Where's Sartorius?
In his lab. He won't let you in.
He'll let me in.
You didn't bring any chocolate, did you?
What?
I love chocolate. I realized just yesterday how much I love it. I thought maybe, if they let you bring personal effects, you might have snuck some through, because... well, I've been thinking about it.
Tell me what?
Ben, I think we're two civilized human beings. Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?
Well how do we look?
S'pose you've never thought of killing him--
I tried to talk to her... It was like I knew her. Weird.
I know.
You've got a helluva lotta coke there, man!
It's fuckin' real! It's fuckin' real!
Do you want some wine, sweetheart?
It'll get ya high.
I don't know! A fuckin' lot!
Tell me.
No, um... I was gonna take a cab.
You didn't have a gun in your hand last night?
I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
Say you're the one who got me in this!
Uh... you-you wanna lift?
Hi. Oh, hi. Hi.
Ma, I'm gonna take her home now. It's getting late, and the buses only run about one an hour.
Friend of yours?
I'll be around long after you're dead, Airk! You slime! When I get outa here I'll cut your head off and stick it on a pig-pole!
You don't know anything about ba- bies.
Nobody's gonna take your baby. Know why? Nobody cares... Except me. You wanna go back to your farm. You wanna go back to your family. I could take care of that baby. I'll look after her like she was me own.
I hate this.
Whatcha thinkin' about, Willow?
I'm proud of you, Sam.
Don't be. And hide whatever that new drug is you have. I like it.
Are you listening to me? You're involved in this! I want to go to the police and tell them I was mixed up in this thing tonight?
You're absolutely right!
That's not what I mean. I've never done anything right. I've been going around with my head in a sling for years...I don't want to drag you into this but I can't help it. I don't think I can prove anything by going around pretending I'm tough any more, so maybe you look like one thing but you still feel like another.
Well, just get it off your chest, son.
I can't keep it to myself anymore--
I told you Dad, it was a question of honor. They called me chicken-- you know, chicken! I had to go or I would never have been able to face any of those kids again. So I got in one of these cars and a boy called Buzz got in the other. We had to drive fast and jump before the cars went over the edge of the bluff. I got out okay but Buzz didn't. He was killed.
Just relax, please relax!
She never wants to hear. She doesn't care!
Then I'm here till I die?
How much did you lose?
How could they recognize you? I don't recognize you. Anyway, you don't have a choice. You run, you may as well sign a confession, turn us both in right now. No, we stick this out-- find out what we can but change nothing. This is a minor inconvenience is all it is. We've taken worse heat than this. Jesus, if I'd known you were going to go belly up on me at the last fucking gasp, I wouldn't have bothered. You can't quit on me now. I've put too much into this. Besides, this stuff is mine. I had other offers, you know. I could have rented myself out to somebody with a spine. You want me to wheel in there and finish the job myself? We'll take off all right, from pad 18 just like we planned.
And keep your lashes on your lids where they belong. How could you be so careless?
Could be worse. They could have found it in your eye.
Come on--we're taking off.
Where?
In a corridor.
Where is your head, Jerome? You're acting like a guilty man. They won't marry the eyelash to you. They won't believe that one of their elite navigators could have suckered them for the last five years.
They'll recognize me.
I'm not going anywhere. Less than a week to go. Not on your life--
--You don't understand, they'll make the connection, they'll hoover again. We should cut our losses.
High time you got back.
... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on.
Huh. That was nice of me.
My what?
They're not bad.
Oh.
I don't smoke?
This is ridiculous, Lovejoy. Find her.
He does landscapes.
Are you really interested?
You always run with the well open?
I cry at the opera.
I dunno, that lady sounded pretty sure...
That's good. You're learning. But let me tell you why I know she was lying. First off, Betty would never fall for a soap star. It's beneath her.
How much?
Hmm?
Well, we won't.
You gentlemen care for a drink?
By all means.
Well, what makes you think I haven't?
Huh. You know, Rick, watching you just now with the Deutsches Bank, one would think you'd been doing this all your life.
Hello Ugarte.
You think?
Cecile. This is what I like to call quiet time. This is time when we reflect on what we've done.
I'm taking a shower.
Bernie.
White turns to black. Light to Dark. Life to Death. For all eternity.
And then it will be too late. The goal of evil is to wipe out life! All forms of life. For all eternity...Life upsets it.
Yes..thank God..
I'd like to offer my congratulations. That was a beautiful gesture of Howard's.
I am thrilled for you, but tell me this... How'd you get Howard to do it? I've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.
God. I dunno. The eternal nothingness. Mia.
A mark, huh?
Hold still, Del, we're just talking here... Then you grab a big handful of hair and pull as you cut. It's amazing how easily the scalp comes off.
Yeah, she loves to go out in the woods.
Now, that's really stupid.
Stupid is calling people in Kansas City who are affiliated with the rightful owners of the thing you stole, and trying to sell it to them. Right Wesley?
So you see, we have totally different ideas of what's stupid and what's not. Don't we?
You know, a hundred and fifty years ago you'd have been scalped for that remark about Native Americans. Right here where your house is -- you'd have been scalped.
It wasn't always fatal, Wesley. We could scalp Del right now, and he'd be plenty alive to tell us how it feels.
How's everything?
How will I know?
But I go nuts. It's a conflict.
You're that smart?
You're giving them to me?
Call it an expression of trust.
You'll just have to have faith.
Thought you had to use some of these.
You don't really think I'd leave ten million dollars worth of our chips in her bag? What matters isn't what's real. It's what we think is real--what matters is the art.
Of course it smells like fish. We're on the ocean. What'd you expect, Chanel number five?
It's paradise. That's what it is. Paradise.
Well, they should. Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again.
And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai?
After my wife died, Grammoo moved in here to help take care of Vada. They were very close, but lately as her mind's been wandering more and more, Vada's been acting kinda crazy. I'm sure she'll snap out of it though.
Thanks, listen I wanna apologize for the other day downstairs, about Vada, I was a little harsh.
Uh...
Let me put it this way: have you ever heard of Plato, Aristotle, Socrates?
Yeah. Well, I do.
Goin' to see my kid.
Hey, I can take a hint. You look great today.
But if there can be no arrangement, then we are at an impasse.
I think I came. Didn't you feel it?
Fine.
Yes, I'll tell you - for the same reason I've never wanted to go out with those social parasites, those sweet-smelling fashion plates. I don't like them. They bore me. They give me the jitters.
Go downstairs, and tell them - anything. Tell them I'm not going. Tell them I'm not home.
Anne, come here. Listen
I'll tell you what. Let's you and me sneak out all by ourselves
I'm afraid so -- I can't compete with you physically. And you're no match for my brains.
Of course Darling, you'd like to apologise?
You really are a piece of work, you know that? You walk out on me and my family for some worthless bum and you expect us to help him when he screws up.
Oh, I see. But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer.
Luke didn't smoke.
So, what have you got to say for yourself? Was he good in bed?
Oh! That will be sent after him. I have a fancy to look into that red box which contains his papers, you say; and at noon, after parade, shall be at the inn. You will not say a word to any one there regarding the affair, and will wait for me at the Chevalier's rooms until my arrival. We must force that box. You are a clumsy hound, or you would have got the key long ago.
You say he drives after breakfast and before dinner. When he comes out to his carriage a couple of gendarmes will mount the box, and the coachman will get his orders to move on.
And his baggage?
What is to be done?
Has he sent the challenge yet?
Not yet, but I believe he intends to.
When is he to go?
Slider -- they let you into Top Gun? If you're among the best in the Navy, I tremble for the security of this country.
The list is long, but distinguished.
Keller, Black Lion Squadron. I knew him at Pensacola. He's damn good.
Gotta keep track of the competition.
Is there anybody in the Navy you don't know?
This is Maverick.
When'd you quit smoking?
Tell her you need to see her.
Shut up!
Yeah, well welcome to the nineties.
Tell her, what the hell, close early today, live dangerously.
I take it you don t know where he is, then?
How old were you?
What kind of look?
I know. I know. We don't have to talk about that.
I did too.
There will be no arrangement -- -- and you're killing her!
I'll get your bag.
Mom, tell him I'm not going. You already promised me!
You'll know me by the time we're through.
Good God, Marquise --
He's not spending the summer in Tahoe.
Who are you, anyway? I don't even know you.
Did you tell him he was spending the summer with me?
You have everything?
Oh, I wouldn't let them stop me from seeing you. So I threw them out!
Is Mary home?
If you get injured, you get nothing.
Won't happen. I'm strong in my mind.
How far do we go with this?
How do you feel?
You did?
Okay. Check, please. Can I -can I... Can I... Can I...
Hey, you didn't read "Death in Venice" till I bought it for yuh.
So whatta you... You're not gonna come back to New York?
I can't enjoy anything unless I... unless everybody is. I-you know, if one guy is starving someplace, that's... you know, I-I... it puts a crimp in my evening. So wanna get married or what?
That's right, 'cause it's an important issue.
A girl.
Probably in the bible.
Yes. I'm going to give my queer neighbor a lift to Baltimore.
Goodnight.
And with it came love! Oh Gallagher, you've got to meet her. She's it
Oh, you don't appreciate it. Her pictures don't do her justice. Why, Gallagher, she's queenly - she is queenly - and I know queens! And oh, has she got herself a nose - and I know noses too. That little snozzle of hers is the berries, I tell you. And is she cute when she throws that little snozzle to the high heavens!
If there's some mental health foundation that raises money to help people like you be sure to let me know.
How does it?
You will never age for me, nor fade, nor die.
Really?
Oh, come, you don't need that.
No, no, no, what... You can once, you can live without it once. Come on.
I don't know. You- It's like you're- you're removed.
Heh heh.
At this point my client is still prepared to consider reconciliation.
My client is prepared to entertain an amicable dissolution of the marriage without prejudice.
My client proposes a thirty day cooling off period.
My client asks that you not initiate proceedings pending his setting certain affairs in order.
Yeah -- he doesn't happen to know that we went together, does he?
You going to tell him?
Look at this.
With pride. What can I do for you?
I guess somebody beat me to it.
Need any more, you can always get it off his shoes.
Well?
She's perfect, perfect.
Not just a patient -- me.
Will you think about it?
Now I'm embarrassed.
Forgive me, I'm trying to cheer myself up and an affair with a beautiful nurse seemed like just the thing to do it.
Get some sleep. See you tomorrow.
I'm not about love -- I'm about "showing you the money."
Good. I was just testing ya. But just you saying that? Makes me love ya.
You're loving me now, aren't ya?
I gotta get back to Cushman.
Okay, I understand. I'll boil it down for ya. Fuck Nike. All they do is ignore me...
Call me tomorrow.
I might call you later!
That would be great. It better help. What can you do with yourself if all you do is look good?
I have to talk to her.
Yeah.
I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody.
Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut.
I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here?
Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat.
That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay?
We're a few minutes away. Just sit tight, stay outta the house till we get there, understand?
Nothing. I'm not going to be around for a while. I'll call you when I can.
We talked him into it.
You go ahead. Of what I remember about Earth... it's all one thing now. Everything's a blur. I like distinctions.
Do you believe that you will have a better time with me than you would with Preysing?
Don't say "spec" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play! Plato never got a book advance...
But I can't leave with you. I won't make it.
When doesn't he have bronchitis? I wouldn't call his bronchial infections "underdeveloped." Would you?
Did you bite it?
Fuzzy is not uncommon. I tell you, there's something about the premature babies of alcoholic mothers. They seem susceptible to every damn thing that comes along.
I haven't read that.
I haven't, either. But you will . The morons who write the books should do a little research here .
But isn't Fuzzy just... well, underdeveloped?
There are going to be trials, they want me to interpret, don't they know I'm allergic to courtrooms?
We shall miss you.
I can do that. I want to do that. For all of us. I need to do that as a man... Think about it. No more lousy restaurants, no more clipping coupons, no more shoveling snow...
Could I speak to Carlos or Deborah?
Hana tells me you're leaving.
I have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. Comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.
Goodbye, my friend. They shake hands.
May God make safety your companion.
There is no God. But I hope someone looks after you.
She knows how she feel.
Sorry. I don't know anything about it.
You-you re wrong. I just called to ask if I could stay with him next time I m in London. That s all.
I love you. I love you.
I don't know. I, uh -- I frankly don't even want to talk about it.
Valerie, it feels like there's a bunch of butterflies flapping around in my stomach. Is that normal?
Good. I was concerned.
Well, long-term exposure to things like this tends to give you a sort of clinical understanding of the subject. After awhile, you begin to make friends with it, so to speak.
So you can see where you're going when you crawl up his asshole.
Thanks for having me, Sally.
Really? You know, seeing these guys away from the court, the facade slips. You catch things.
So, Viznick's got a meet with his lawyer in the ayem.
What's this?
Yeah, yeah. I've heard it before. Just be sure you spell my name right. Nine o'clock?
What s a French private investigator doing here?
I never tried to kid you reporters -- I'm telling you the truth.
Can I get up now?
As you know from speaking to Phil, your friend Leon has disappeared, Rhian. His family have hired me to find him.
I draw the line at seven un-returned phone calls.
I am.
Oh!
Yes, I guess I'll have to.
Thank you. If you feel the building rock, it'll be me blasting into this editor.
But what about this "Cinderella Man"?
That's my job. I'll take care of that. I'll keep that stuff out of the papers - if you'll help me. But I can't do anything if you go around talking to people. Will you promise me to be careful from now on?
If they're going to poke fun at me, I'm going to
Listen. Listen, Longfellow. You've got brains, kid. You'll get along swell if you'll only curb your homicidal instincts - and keep your trap shut. Don't talk to anybody! These newshounds are out gunning for you.
Sometimes it's the only solution.
Not editors. Take my word for it. Not editors!
Cobb's right. I mustn't talk to anybody.
Miss Dawson on the phone, sir.
C'mon, just do it.
Yeah, it's Frass Canyon. It's a joke.
Peggy Sue, watch your mouth.
Look at those eyes.
My father. He's not just the ultimate square. He's a total crook.
I can dig you being uptight about Rita and Utah. That's cool. But I've got to warn you about something.
Didn't call, them pantyhose, though. What was it, Evelyn?
It's the darndest thing. Ed knew what they were immediately. As a matter of fact, he said he's got a product like that in development right now.
Say what?
Yeah, once they're mated they stay together all their lives until one of 'em dies.
Want to go out and have one with me?
Come on, I know a quiet one, with a special entrance for ladies... .
I say we check it out. You never know.
Yeah, and you keep not answerin', too.
So does Eddie.
A little, although I'm afraid I generally lose.
Now and then. Why, do you?
And I you. I think I've heard about you, Mr. Felson. You play pocket billiards, don't you?
Glad to meet you.
Well, hello. Haven't seen you in a long time.
No, no more for me.
Most assuredly.
I've just the story... inspired by these very surroundings....
Soon as I start the car... and fix my hat.
Guess there's no way I'll ever know. For sure.
Have you got your passport?
Are you kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me?
What?
What?
Accident?
We're on after Meadowlark. What's wrong?
This is good. It is a good story, Fish.
We don't let go, you s...
If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true. All accurate.
Erin --
Morons.
Oh.
How old are you?
Forty.
We were probably in school together. You went to Berkley?
Maybe...?
That's too long.
Class of eighty-six! I didn't know you were there.
I was a sophomore when I got the call my parents were dead.
No, it isn't. I'm getting a divorce.
Good for you.
I'm afraid you're blocking my view.
Clever fellow -- almost missed me.
The one you're blocking. This is the last chance I have -- I'm flying back to Paris this afternoon. What's your name?
Sorry. Which view would you like?
I'm Regina Lampert.
Peter Joshua.
Yes.
Is there a Mr. Lampert?
How do you know what kind of sex they had?
We know what happened from the bits and pieces we were able to paste together -- but we still have no proof.
But what has all this got to do with the C.I.O.?
That's over. Way over.
Carson was dying so they were forced to leave him. They finally got back to the base, made their report, and waited for the war to end. Only Charles couldn't wait quite as long as the others. He beat them back to the gold, took everything for himself and disappeared. It's taken Gideon, Tex and Scobie all this time to catch up with him again.
But if they stole all that money -- why can't you arrest them?
It's okay. You... You thought I was bad.
It's a small post and they're phasing it out in two years, but I moved up in rank and--well, a command is a command.
Uncle Al--
You were saying?
Tell him I'm out. No, tell him I've passed away. An old war wound or something. Tell him I'm dead. And no more calls!
Why don't we ask him?
Hell!
Yeah... wow.
"Turn you out?"
But in your opinion, would I definitely go?
Well... you couldn't have been desperate to see it, otherwise you'd have already gone...
I never thought I would say this, but can I go work now?
It's hot in here.
How the fuck am I supposed to know that? You might get sick of people telling you you've really gotta go see the movie.
I'll have to wash one out.
You don't have a clean glass in the house.
Okay, thanks.
Me!
Who?
But you are certain that he died by drowning.
Is it fair to say that you do not know for certain which it was.
And that you can't say for certain whether the head injury was sustained before or after death?
So if his head struck something narrow and flat, the gunnel of a boat, a net roller, a fairlead, could that have...
Is it possible?
Not for Quincy McCall.
Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila.
It's nice to see you.
Okay...It's so good to see you.
Really?
What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
Good.
You comfortable?
Yeah.
I don't know - I'm American.
Yeah. Are you sure?
No. You're not.
I am very sorry.
Hurry up, Pop.
Sorry.
I don't know. He don't seem like a guy that'd fall into line.
And she has...?
Video.
Gimme three sloppy joes and a coupla cups of hot stuff.
You almost sound like you believe that.
That's the old Rick!
I'm all ears, good buddy.
Home.
Yes, I still have friends on the force.
Show her a good time, but for God's sake restrain yourself.
Is this because of the radiation?
Uh-huh.
Is that a birthday cake?!
Get moving--
What did they do with you?
Impossible. There's no system that wouldn't value one of us.
They booted me out of Washington.
It's what he did. I'm proud of him.
Why? What did they do to you?
The cost-efficient reporter.
They told me they'd keep me because they could plug me into any story and my salary was in line.
The business is changing, Rat. I'll tell you, these kids today... they don't even listen to Aerosmith.
This is Barry.
I don't know.
Ok. Have a good trip.
Hi.
I see your point... though why should I care?
Sounds intriguing.
Why go through Cecile? Why not just attack Court?
Great, isn't it?
Really? Um... I... well... you're really turning me around here,
Is this slow enough for you?
Well, except for one thing. I used to work at a smorgasbord, and, and the old people would flock there, and, and they loved to eat. And they just jammed their mouths, you know? The used to eat with their mouths open, and you know, it's just too much for me. You get to be thinking about how short life is, and how maybe, maybe has no meaning because you wake up and you're frying burgers
It's the best collection I've ever seen.
SO!
He dropped them off at Betty's mom. Where's Steve?
I sincerely hope so--
Why can't it last?
Well, no, Johnny, I just thought I should've been told if
So look, kid, you don't think we c'n afford to be boxed out of a deal like this a deal I sweated and bled for on account of one lousy little cheese-eater, that Doyle bum, who thought he c'd go squealin' to the Crime Commission? Do you?
Do you?
Call him a love-child, if you want to. Duffy!
Hildy!
We'll lower it out of the window with pulleys. Quit stallin'.
Get the lead out of your typewriter and start pounding out a load, will you? Snap into it!
All the words you've got.
Yes... I guess I knew that.
Naw, thanks, Johnny, I don't want it, I
That's what I've been trying to tell these people.
Okay.
Maybe we'll get a dog when we get back.
Sure.
What do you mean, okay? Wouldn't you like a dog?
You got it all worked out, don't you?
See you made it.
Nobody. It just came to me.
Don't be pissed. I'm on your side, Pard. I just don't want you to do something you'll regret. You gotta give six years to the Navy if you wanna fly... that's six years with the most uptight assholes God put on this earth. Officers aren't like you and me, man. It's another breed.
Fuck, no! Why would I care about something as dumb as that?
You afraid you'll have to salute me, Chief?
Hey, what did you want? A lot of fatherly bullshit? A big pat on the back?
I don't know. That's just how it sounded. Well, I'll see you.
Hey, Zackie -- don't go away mad.
From you, pard? Never. Thanks for the graduation present.
I fear she's lost.
Mayhap you be the one what's lost, and she safe by the castle hearth... but, come Jack, we'll warm your bones.
Twas the Princess Lili gave me the answer... have you seen her, by chance?
I've laid eyes on no mortal but you this day, Jack.
Go down in my room.
Without havin' good people around, ya won't have such a good chance.
I told you to shut up.
What happened?
The dagger --?
You fainted.
Look, this is my house. I'd like to
Prepare yourself, Drew - I am --
-- An IRS man.
I'll take it from here -- I am --
Help what?
Moreover, Agent Joe Black here -- of course that's not his real name -- smelled out your involvement, Drew. He developed evidence you were working both sides of the fence. Unfortunately, that's known as a conflict of interest --
And we're very grateful.
Sorry, honey! I just got to fooling with this darn rheostat.
You bet, hon!
There's no hurry. Take you time.
Yeah.
So you just protect the President the whole time? That's your whole job?
You sound very cute, very nice.
I do pretty good, I think. I wish I was making more, doing a little bit better. I can,t get over a certain hump. I will...I will crack something soon I think and really do better...I'd like to diversify...but I'm doing great, I think, as a start.
No.
Burger God. The ones that found the pig hair in the french fries?
That was especially Monkeybone. Come on, Doc, I don't want to be stuck here with this bunch of media creeps. I just want to be us. Home. Alone! I have something I have to give you.
They don't love me. They love Monkeybone.
Julie and I - we were just gonna go...
Yeah, I could, but the thing is, if later got here sooner, it would be...better.
I'll take you there. We'll live in the sun. You'll cook fresh fish and we'll make love under the coconut trees.
Yes, of course, I'll do the Hula!
He looks strange, doesn't he? Like a baby that just learned to walk.
Give what up?
Pick a card.
Yeah -- I know what you mean. Queen.
A bad insurance risk?
True. I guess she hadn't completely given up hope. Are you sure you're seventeen?
Whoa. Deja Vu.
Can I help you, sir!
I was thirsty.
You're the boss.
Should we take it seriously?
The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?
Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
Wednesday -- Wednesday -- I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
Tricks, is it? Why I'll trick ye! Ungrateful whelp! I'll sour your milk and bird droppings'll fall from the sky wherever ye walk.
We've no time for tricks this day, Honeythorn Gump.
I'm small... and I can make myself smaller still... Small as a bee! Small as dust...! Want to see me do it?
The colt's still too small.
Don't see why I can't ride, too! I'm second in command, damn it!
No fear of that now.
Where s your follow through? Where s your stance?
Jesus, Jack, this is a league match, for god s sake!
Now about the Falkner sisters. That's kind of funny. I mean about Mr. Cedar going all the way to Mandrake Falls to bring them here. Do you mind if I talk to them?
It could be fun.
... Not exactly the Oval Office.
I missed...
Rochester? Well, why Rochester?
Terrific.
And what's that mean?
Mmmm, I love the smell of a woman.
Who is that girl, anyway?
Well, then, you know Cousin Johnny isn't going to jeopardize a setup like that for one rubber-lipped
I know. I know.
ex-tanker who's walking on his heels ?
Thanks. Come on Chris, give me a hand.
You don't mean you're thinking of testifying against
Listen, Terry, these piers we handle through the locals you know what they're worth to us?
Where'd you get that horse?
I asked where you got him.
I don't know I don't know! I tell you I ain't made up my mind yet. That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
Look, I don't want any trouble With you but that's my horse and I mean to have him back. One way Or another.
Look kid, I know what it's like, I was a kid, too. Even stole a Horse once. But you can't--
Then what are you getting so upset about?
Well it fucking should be, shouldn't it?
I'm all right, if that's what's upsetting you.
Meet a nice girl and have children. I promise the next time we talk I'll have it all sorted out.
I'm going to drink this bottle of wine watch TV and go to bed. Then tomorrow I'll get up and go to work.
Make anyone cry today?
About twenty-five hundred dollars.
I could get a company doctor in twenty minutes.
But --
What tricks would I pull?
Now you're talking!
No. After he was born, every time we started to make love, he would cry. He had an uncanny sense of timing. We really shouldn't do anything here anyway.
Man, I don't even want to see those guys from Carl's again.
I'm just glad we're still together, Lisa, because I need you this year.
Apologize to that wimp? No way. Fuck Dennis Taylor.
-- It's about being realistic. Something like this, Erin -- it could take forever. They're a huge corporation. They'd completely bury us in paperwork. I'm just one guy with a shitty little P.I. firm.
I know how DNA works, Erin --
Oh, you do? With all your legal expertise, you believe that?
How many families we talking about here?
Are you kidding? You think this is my idea of morning-after conversation?
I thought that business with the scarf was pretty nifty.
Kate s my wife...
It s not Kate, is it?
It s just two kids, right?
Look, you fit the profile exactly. Thirties, house, kids, financial responsibilities. You start thinking...this isn t the life I dreamt about. Where s the romance, where s the joie de vivre? Suddenly, every lingerie ad in the Newark Star Ledger represents a life you can t have...
What's the matter?
No... be dark before we get there. You wanna see the Grand Canyon at night?
What difference does it make? She wasn't in Kansas City, or Houston, or Dallas. We went to every goddamn place Del mentioned and no Betty. So what the hell makes you think she's in Vegas? You think she's waiting for us with tassles on her titties? Vegas is too crass for Betty.
Do you want -- do you want to try and tell me why you did it?
We should go.
We don't have time to look at a hole in the ground. We can make Vegas in four hours. This one's got to be her.
It's a very moving experience, trust me.
No.
One of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World.
Don't touch them. I feel terrible sneezing at a time like this. This is a big moment for me --
What are you doing in my room?
Okay.
I've been hearing you.
You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
You didn't grab her and try to kiss her?
How about a nice glass of milk?
Her favorite poet.
Like so. There you go. Okay, hit me!
Nice disguise.
I'm looking for Charley. I heard Charley was waiting for me. Charley?
You sure it's not just 'coz you jerk off too much?
All my life I've worked to unlock the power of the unconscious mind. Well this is it. This is power!
Fuck me...
I see you are thinking of a certain young lady at Duganstown.
Is Miss Dugan well?
I suppose she addressed them to me in my real name, by which I never thought to ask for them at the post office.
We must write to her today, and you can tell her that you are safe and married to "Brown Bess."
Grogan gave me a wink of recognition, but offered no public token of acquaintance and it was not until two days afterwards that he called me into his quarters, and then, shaking hands with me cordially, gave me news which I wanted, of my family.
I had news of you in Dublin. Faith, you've begun early, like your father's son, but I think you could not do better than as you have done. But why did you not write home to your poor mother? She has sent half-a-dozen letters to you in Dublin.
No. But I've got a penknife.
Hitch-hiking.
There it is. Better swallow it. We're not going to have any breakfast.
That's right... and we might as well face it.
Rita. Rita.
Look.
It's Cosmo's moon.
I mean it's that moon I was talking about at dinner. Is he down there? No.
Cosmo.
Uhhh...Anything I can do for you? She laughs again, doesn't know what it is...could be chemical, but she's instinctively attracted.
It's not my back that's killing me.
Good morning. I worried about you, last night. You shouldn't have run like that.
Oh my, yes! This is a far superior taste--and crisp, too! You know, so many apples are disappointingly mealy. I wonder of most of the apples in my life weren't meant for pies!
A little ? Sure, I'll be right up. He's all right. I like him.
"King Kong". It's really good.
I don't need any new ties. I've got another tie - I've got another one besides this one. And it's a pip, too. There's only one thing wrong with it. You know what that is? It has a little weakness for gravy, and once in a while it leans a little toward ketchup. Of course that's only in its weaker moments. When you move down to my place, I'll show it to you.
What's the matter? Something I et, no doubt. Egg marks the spot
Yeah. Oh, it's great. Of course it doesn't compare with this coliseum of yours here, but 'twill serve m'lady, 'twill serve. The architecture has a little feeling of Missouri Gothic - and the furniture sort of leans toward Oklahoma Renaissance - with a tiny touch of Grand Rapids.
I wouldn't worry, Edna, that he doesn't have money. If he gets hungry, he can pick his dinner!
I wouldn t mind. Thank you.
Hah... What about Nathalie?
I'm glad what I done today, see? You give it to Joey, you give it to Nolan, you give it to Charley who was one of your own. You thought you was God Almighty instead of a cheap conniving good-for-nothing bum! So I'm glad what I done you hear me? glad what I done!
There's soft music--
Okay, look. It's an important meeting. Kurt thought, if it was just lawyers --
Look, this is serious now. They're talking serious money --
You're emotional. You're erratic. You say any God damn thing that comes into your head. And I'm not saying that's bad. That can be great; that can be a lot of fun --
Okay, now you're making this personal, and it isn't --
No one's taking anything --
Fine--I'll be glad to.
Look, Lester... are you unhappy with me about something?
What's funny?
Yeah -- My ol' man who was never the sharpest told me -- I weren't born with much brain so I better use my body.
No, how about you?
I'm here for the week.
Ok.
I know, it's stupid.
Now wait a minute...
Yes.
I am Captain Renault, Prefect of Police.
I'm sorry. It is.
Monsieur Laszlo, is it not?
Yes. What is it you want?
Merely to welcome you to Casablanca and wish you a pleasant stay. It is not often we have so distinguished a visitor.
Okay, sure.
I'd appreciate it. I like knowing who I'm stealing from. If you can't create art I think the least you can do is recognize it around you, don't you think? There is... ... so much beauty.
You sure you won't let me help you with those dishes?
Francesca?
Are you all right?
Thank God we're beginning at the beginning.
As you remember it -- when you approached us...
We did not approach you.
I know you did -- I said you did --
And I said we didn't.
I am Felix Benvenuto von Gaigern. My mother called me Flix.
I'm a prodigal son, the black sheep of a white flock -- I shall die on the gallows.
You want to take a walk with me?
Was the trip okay?
...and how long did she work here?
Hmm... you two in high school together?
I see. May I?
Thank you for your cooperation. Just one more thing... did she ever talk about getting rich?
That's right. How' you doin', Barney?
Yeah...
That you're just like your mother.
You're nervous again.
To our...partnership.
Little celebration before we set off.
Where are you at least?
Certainly the most beautiful crook I've ever seen.
Hey! We came over to help you with Math homework!
Thanks. Great. Wish me luck.
Fine work, Pete! You certainly delivered the goods. I'm proud of you.
Very poor. He was suffering from severe arterial disease.
A massive cardiac arrest.
Reggie -- I think I've found -- are you on?
No -- last time I said "I love you, Alex."
I'm looking forward to that.
We have two kids, Annie and Josh...
Uh...that baby s crying...
HEY!
Hello!
We made our collection at Roderick's place and that was the last anybody seen hide nor hair of him. He went missing the next day, along with ten thousand dollars in county funds from the safe at the jail.
Never heard from him again?
Oh--he come to an accommodation. Money doesn't always need to change hands to keep the wheels turning.
Right.
Look, I know you had some problems with your father, and he and Muriel-- well--
Well, I have to get a message to her. I have to let her know I'm okay. Until I can get out of here...
-- When I took you out riding, come rain or shine, because I knew it was right for you, when I kept the bairns off your back so you could have a bit of peace, when I saw you safe from home to home and you didn't even know I was there...! All I've ever thought about is you!
Don't be a mug all your life--I'm trying to help you-- you need me more than I need you--have you figured they might pick the kid up in France and extradite him?
You're tellin' him what he wants to hear, but that ain't the same thing as kissin' his ass.
You don't think I'm kissin' his ass, do you?
That's why it doesn't come across as ass-kissin', because it's genuine, and he can see that.
I'm not lyin' to him. I mean it. I loved "Coming Home in a Body Bag".
We should talk alone.
Kid - didn't they tell you about this party?
Whoever, I Look, maybe you ought to take a walk and clear your head. I'II meet you back at the motel.
Death! Death! Always so glum! What about life, Ninotchka! Do Russians never think of life? Of the moment in which we are living? The only moment we really have? Don't take it all so seriously, Ninotchka. Nothing is worth it. Please... relax... I beg you, Sergeant... smile!
Oh, Ninotchka, who wants to talk business. If you win the suit, fine. If we win the suit, better. You do me an injustice. When we went to my apartment did I have the slightest idea that you had any connection with this deal?
Must one always be after something?
Just an old man. His memory is getting weak.
Will you smile?
Did I say that?
You going to get married?
Yes... yes.
Shrapnel!
No.
Manicure...
Stay, huh?
I'm just glad someone finally put this thing in its proper perspective.
I'll call George's parents. Tell them I need a best man who actually looks after me.
Yes I do.
All righ...
Please --
You know I'm not a communist, don't you, Jer?
I'm not mad at you. Okay, I'm not mad at you.
I'm trying to buy you a suit.
No, it's not right.
Would you like to take a turn around the deck with me?
Go in there and lick his attitude.
Didn't you once dream you could lick people well, though?
Oh...with his ear infection!
Absolutely not.
No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby. It looks like a daikini...
Uh... Yes.
How is bank?
To be indoors on such a day. It's crime.
Fine. I thought you were leaving today.
What's wrong?
But I do know. I also know your lines of credit are over-extended. If I don't buy your company, someone else will... Ah, the escargot.
Oh, you won't be so lonely. You'll make friends right away.
No. What I have is a lot of money.
Good news comrades, it's better than we'd hoped. Lubosh filled me in on the legal side of squatting here and it's a piece of cake.
Well, providing we're treated like Czechs and we squat something that's not privately owned, we should be in the clear; at least DOUG until they get an eviction order and bring in the bailiffs.
No "if's" or "but's" it's a cinch. Do you want to know what the icing is?
Here's the info you asked for.
Okay.
Thanks.
All right. Tell 'em to shoot to kill.
Ya nose is broke.
Just -- one -- second!
Sure she is. That's why she got an unlisted number and you haven't heard squat from her in a dozen years. Oh you're good, Ted. You're a real piece of work.
People nothin', you in a fight, my man, -- ya best believe what you hear... Knock that boy out soon an' let's go home.
Fucking Sully! Look at you!
I don't buy it and neither will a jury.
Suspicions maybe -- but suspicions aren't enough for a conviction.
Why would she want that?
C'mon -- think about it. If she was going to kill Marsh why leave the nasal spray bottle there for the police to find?
You're bluffing. John, it's me, remember? I've known you since your name was Juan Carlos.
I'll tell her but she won't take it.
Judy, it can't make much difference to you. I just want to see how you'd look and I know it won't be the same, but --
Good morning --
Romeo and Rosaline. Scene One! God, I'm good!
No. I think I better just go.
It's alright.
What's your name?
Whatever.
Do you know where we are?
Where's your husband?
Do you ever see him?
No.
Who?
Yes -- that --
Yes -- it's stimulating -- a man might --
I'm waiting for him here. The Baron and I have been together all day. A hundred miles an hour -- in a motor car -- and in an aeroplane -- It was marvelous --
Oh, thank you, Miss Flaemm. Oh, please, Miss Flaemm -- Permit me, Miss Flaemm, won't you have something sweet -- a Louisiana flip. A Louisiana flip.
I hope he got his mother's permission.
I don't know -- I'd like to do anything --
I can't do that. Five guys.
No, no, no, no, no, no, I mean only two guys.
Nope.
Yeah, then if I get jets, it's on to Beeville, Texas.
No. Is that what you want?
No, it's okay. It was a great free meal. Everybody was so uptight I felt sorry for you.
Nope. Not even when I was young.
What would you do differently?
But I need help and they sent you.
Hello, Miss Ilsa. I never expected to see you again.
No. Two champagne cocktails, please.
My bill.
Vivian --
No, I want to see the dessert cart.
Never is a long time.
My scalp is not getting enough blood sometimes.
Have Something.
Will you marry me?
I thought I told you not to answer the phone.
So sometimes you were carrying just your sword?
That insults them.
This is not worth eight pounds, Mrs. Clifton.
I should be very happy to obtain the correct price for this. I apologize if I appear abrupt. I am rusty at social graces. How do you find Cairo? Did you visit the Pyramids?
Are you saying that if you had not been carrying your banner you'd have killed more people?
OK. OK. But now that I've got a job, I'11 probably stop going...
Any room for me in this Cinema Paradiso?
That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while. Will you be all right here?
I just might do that.
My soul, woman. I give you three murders and you aren't satisfied.
What?
I love this guy!
Yeah, but I don't like the idea of walking in on your jamboree . . . Just between you and me those things give me a stiff pain.
No no. What the deuce do I want to
That's a fact.
No shit?
How's it going?
Yeah.
Hi, Naomi, it's Joel.
I just got in.
I know. I had to take the day to think.
I found it on the seat.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews.
Just a spoiled brat of a rich man. You and Westley'll make an ideal team.
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York.
He was nervous.
We could come to my room.
Good!
Gambling! I'd like that. I have over six thousand eight hundred marks with me.
If we could scare up some men to play.
Ready, Kringelein?
Ready, Baron.
Going?
Oh. Okay.
Yeah.
Okay. Up you go, Mollie.
Kind of exclusive, ain't you? We got calls to make, you know.
Mollie Malloy -- what happened to her?
She looks as though she's going to come to.
I'm sure, I said.
God, I should know. Your hair was red. I remember it matched the wallpaper.
No! I think you were wearing that black dress, y'know, with the buttons.
We did talk about Naomi.
Oh.
Maybe so. You ever go back there? Where it happened.
Let me see you. Take off your hat.
By coveting my property. I cannot shed blood in her house but I will cut your throat anon. You have a name?
They re German Jews. Came here before the war. They both lost all their families in extermination camps, but they themselves never went near one. The idea that his family wealth was started with money he believes should have gone to camp survivors has been haunting Leon. It s not guilt, more of a curse... And then there s something about his parents being involved with Nazi hunters... But I think that s just one of Leon s dark delusions...
My lady!
No. It's not that.
Do you believe in love?
I suppose it's... I mean define your terms.
It's very strange. How many people are truly themselves with their love? It is the greatest human disaster and it is never in the newspapers. There are no Marches Against Heartache, no Ministries Against Loneliness, no Concerts Against Disappointment. We look away. And still we know in secret that nothing is more important to us. The one thing we all share but don't say. Look John I will show you something.
No. It is too judgmental.
Tell me what he said.
He says why did you send to Russia for a wife.
You are not ashamed of it? It's no surprise to want to love.
Wow!....What have you been doing, rolling around in it?
No way, he even gave me back pay.
Well, don't get carried away.
Where's my baggy pants?
Are you really ever coming back?
Go head on, breaker.
That's a Texas cop. What the hell's he doing in Arkansas?
What's your twenty and what's your handle?
A Texas Bear in Arkansas. Something's up and at this point in my life, I don't want to know what it is.
Hi, everyone. I don t think we've met. I'm Sam Coulson- although for some reason the school has this thing about not letting you guys call me Sam.
Well, it isn't exactly the term I'd have chosen, but I suppose it captures the spirit of the thing.
Well, George, I invest for a lot of people. I make a lot of money for them. More than they could do for themselves.
I'm better than the guy I work for.
But what?
In a way. But...
But the important thing is you're successful at it.
Yes it is.
Hey!--you're tickling me.
Well, someone else besides myself may have seen you in the vicinity of Mrs. Rosson's cabin this evening--even the stewards in that corridor insisted on being searched. Get me?
Sure, I'll go.
I'll go with you.
It's easy to see the Purser hasn't had much practice.
How about trying your fine Italian hand?
This has nothing to do with me-- But always remember, Purser, when you're searching anybody, take the lining of their coat, like this-- --run your fingers all along these seams.... Then-- back of the collar--here--that used to be a favorite trick--and never forget to put your finger down inside of the shoe--like this.
Why?
To be able to do that is such a wonderful thing.
Just follow this. Nothing to it. I'm going to shut my eyes here for a little while. Just keep going till you run out of road.
It's never too soon to start.
I don't have all day.
Put the key in and turn it. The right pedal is gas, the other one's the brake.
Well, there's only one way to find out. Give it a little gas.
... . Ellen.
Oh... Yeah.
Didn't mean to bum you out.
That's okay. You alright down here by yourself?
Oh, sure. Don't worry about it.
No.
Did you just hear something?
I was saying to Quince we won't need --
Nothing. I'm sorry.
No no, not you.
Why yes, Bill, I was saying to Quince --
No. My mother's dead. You goin' back inside?
Oh yeah? That's my home town.
Oh yeah? Well, I guess you got no choice.
No. Never had much use for hell-howlers. You goin'?
Look, I don't know what you been told 'bout section gangs, but how 'bout seein' me sometime?
Very much.
You love me now, don't you?
You feel bad you tested positive? Quit doing blow! You feel bad about your baby girl? Why did you leave the mother?
Don't you even see -- I'm finished. I'm fucked. Twenty-four hours ago, I was hot. Now... I'm a cautionary tale!
See this jacket I'm wearing? You like it? I don't really need it, because I'm CLOAKED IN FAILURE. I lost the number one draft pick the night before the draft. They will teach my story to other agents on "do not do this" day in agent school. Why? Let's recap. Because a hockey player's kid made me feel like a superficial jerk, I had two slices of bad pizza, went to bed, grew a conscience and wrote a 25-page Manifesto of Doom!
Excellent. What is it?
Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro. A little Coleman's mustard.
Are you going to eat your lunch
It's all yours.
Uh-huh.
Cold lamb sandwiches -- not as chewy as roast beef, not as boring as chicken. She knew stuff like that.
Truly - uh - splendid.
Glad you like it. My wife turned me onto cold lamb sandwiches. Joan -- that was my wife --
And more.
Why didn't you stop me?
Oh, come on!
What is it?
They decreed me a savage, and now they have made me one.
What, by a st-stranger?
I'm not going to let this baby die.
Fro--? You want a-a defrosted kid? Is that your idea?
Josie--you make a really beautiful prom queen.
I don't know. Why don't you leave her alone.
McConnell, I'm gonna out your ass in two seconds if you don't tell me where she is.
I told you I don't know.
One.
Who is this?
Sebastian, you faggot. Is she with you?
No.
Where is she?!
Alright. She's staying with some friends of her parents. The O'Sheas. She caught the train twenty minutes ago into Grand Central.
You don't think it's tilted a little too much --
Will you come here?
Hildy, you just can't leave me out on a limb now. It -- it wouldn't be cricket!
Don't open that!
No problem. Why don't we discuss it sometime over the holidays -- I could call you and pick you up and we'll have the big unveiling -- -- you sure this is the right way to wear it?
Look at this wiring. It's shorting out under high temperatures.
You're seeing bugs where they don't exist, Striker.
It's got to be stopped!
I mean the Mercury flight. It's not safe and, Kurtz, you know why.
I know you've been subtly spreading the word that I'm having a breakdown.
You're tired, Striker, overworked. That wiring meets all the safety specifications.
You were ready to bite that guy's face.
He's an actor. One of the great American actors of the 20th century.
Don't you want to know what happened to me?
There's a tiny door in that empty office. It's a portal, Maxine. It takes you inside John Malkovich. You see the world through John Malkovich's eyes, then, after about fifteen minutes, you're spit out into a ditch on the side of The New Jersey Turnpike.
This is important!
Shhh! Not so loud, mayhap he'll hear ye.
I'll always go back to that church.
Ogg's footprints!
Next time he suggests it, I'll tell him I have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.
I guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?
Look -- Elaine Robinson and I do not get along.
How do you know? You haven't seen her since high school. I guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.
That has nothing to do with it --
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson that you're just too busy every evening -- doing God knows what --
I do.
Christ, can't you hear it?
Yeah.
Something came up. Don't worry, Charlie stayed true. Both nights. I'll give you your share tomorrow. At the house.
That's what you were talking about yesterday? Everybody does that in the future?
What are you doing?
So you'll come out, right?
Coffee, that's a laugh. His belly is used to nothing but rotgut whiskey.
Bought it on the way over. Clean as a nun.
There's not going to be a viewing. I figured with the kids and all ...
Go ahead.
No.
Those are gifts.
Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail.
I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend.
The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund.
Plenty of women everywhere right?
Uh...I thought you might know a trick or something. To make her, you know...
How about me? Do you think if I concentrated and put my whole soul into it, that some day I might be a putterer?
--and that he changed his will?
What?! How do I do that?
I can't possibly think of a better reason.
You analyze everything out of existence. You analyze me out of existence. I won't let you. Love is not so simple. Ninotchka, Ninotchka, why do doves bill and coo? Why do snails, coldest of all creatures, circle interminably around each other? Why do moths fly hundreds of miles to find their mates? Why do flowers open their petals? Oh, Ninotchka, Ninotchka, surely you feel some slight symptom of the divine passion... a general warmth in the palms of your hands... a strange heaviness in your limbs... a burning of the lips that is not thirst but a thousand times more tantalizing, more exalting, than thirst?
Harry . . . Harry . . .
We lost.
I'd like you to meet my father.
If I could find the key... find the beginning put it together...
You'll wreck your raincoat.
What do you actually know with religion?
Maybe you're not supposed to.
Your --
The army thinks he was killed in action by the Germans, but I think they did it -- Tex, Gideon and Scobie -- and your husband -- because he wouldn't go along with their scheme to steal the gold. I think he threatened to turn them in and they killed him. I'm trying to prove it. They think I'm working with them. But I'm not, and that's the truth. I'm on your side, Reggie -- please believe that.
We can measure wind.
What now?
We wait -- with our mouths shut.
Let's just keep walking.
Plan?
What's the plan?
It's circling us.
It's moving.
Anywhere! I think we should just keep moving.
Do you think it's a dog?
It's in front of us.
You thought the deceased might... break his promise?
So, then, you...and your husband... must have called friends, relatives, to tell them the amazing news. Yes?
So, five hours. Plenty of time for a call. He was 'excited', you say. In the sense of being 'overjoyed'.
I thought so, too.
Let's just find Coalmine. Listen, Zenovich made a mistake. You didn't let anybody down. It happens
What's up?
Laura. Her dad died.
Are you alright?
God, that's a cold and a half. Maybe you should bet back in bed.
Who the fuck's Pig?
Don't worry about it. Just get into bed. Worry about that when you're better.
Well please leave a message that I called.
Where are you going?
Look about last night --
It's not okay, I mean we've got to talk now. Where are you going?
She knows.
Don't worry about it.
Probably he means no harm.
Then I will consider it a declaration of war. One. Two... three.
Don't pay any attention to him. That's his way and I've found he's sure easy to get along with. I don't recollect him havin' hit me more'n a couple of times and I guess I had it comin'.
I was doin' both. Here.
Like when you were standin' there looking after Clay. I knew right off what you were thinking. Because I've been watching you.
He'll treat his wife just as good. Maybe better. Ever see him use a bull snake on the mules like other wranglers?
Senora, anything it costs, I can work--
Leavin' Detroit. Goin' off on vacations, startin' new lives, business trips. Fun, fun, fun, fun.
Hey, how much of you can be there? Even if the "J. Edgars" do find something, in a week-- you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction. Come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.
The place is crawling with Hoovers.
So what? You didn't kill him, did you?
Hey, sweet cheeks.
Of love?
Albert... Albert and Ethel. Why?
Chicken salad, Devra!
I just don't think it's right, killing an innocent girl.
But here at the Hotel Dieu we favor an... aggressive... course of treatment.
I don't seek popularity or renown, Monsieur Delben . Mine is a higher mission.
You better not slow us down, Denham!
The bourbon. The news about Ugarte upset me very much.
Carrying charges, my boy, carrying charges. Here, sit down. There's something I want to talk over with you, anyhow.
Of course not. What upsets me is the fact that Ugarte is dead and no one knows where those letters of transit are.
You're a fat hypocrite. You don't feel any sorrier for Ugarte than I do.
If I could lay my hands on those letters, I could make a fortune.
I have a proposition for whoever has those letters. I will handle the entire transaction, get rid of the letters, take all the risk, for a small percentage.
So could I. And I'm a poor businessman.
Grace, I need you to come with me.
It's a plan -- -- 51.
Well, no you didn't --
I know. Sorry I threw a scare into our lives there --
Is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?
But I know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.
Who are we talking about?
Has her pain abated?
I'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.
Susan's patient is whom we are talking about.
Go ahead.
You couldn't?
Umm, Ummmmm
Okay, okay.
Buddy-boy -- she won't keep that long -- not even on ice. Listen, kid, I can't pass this up -- she looks like Marilyn Monroe.
No! Don't harm the vessel!
I understand, but we must protect the vessel at all costs. Please, Craig, please step aside and allow us to have what is rightfully ours.
You want...
What is it?
This is my fiancee Maxine.
Yeah. That's how me an' your mother got started. I'm tellin' you, boy, you ain't got a chance without dough. They take it all away from you.
I am not alone. There are others. We are legion. You will pay for this blasphemy. You will pay dearly.
There are rules, boy, procedures, etiquette. This is not a toy. I've been waiting seventy years to utilize this room, grooming myself, quietly setting the stage, performing ablutions, paying tribute, seeing all his motion pictures again and again. Worshipping, Schwartz, worshipping properly.
You're insane.
You're making a big mistake, Schwartz. Ma'am
Dr. Lester, I don't know what you're talking about.
This is amazing! We're gonna be rich!
Fine.
Fine.
Come on, Pop.
What's the matter? Don't smell so good, huh? Must'a broken some records.
Take it easy, Pop.
I ain't drunk, honey.
Is that everything?
You bet.
Cinderella Man! Babe, you stuck a tag on that hick that'll stick to him the rest of his life. Can you imagine Cobb's face when he reads this?
Is he really that big a sap?
Did it?
Don't bother!
Lead man.
Apropos of nothing... so. So so so so --
Ya, that rack holds six ties.
Boys frightened, Lula. This ain't no good.
Vada, just put 'em on the stool.
He's dead. He can't talk.
No.
I can see her if I want to. I mean, with half of France in the hands of the English, what have I got to lose?
Yeah, I can tell he's gonna be a major asset.
Believe me, man; Fred'll be no problem.
Let's just leave it there for now.
No.........but airline miles are just like a currency these days.
You should go on a trip.
No thanks.
So what should I do with the pudding?
Check it out.
Here's a real present.
You were-you were sensational. I mean, I-you know, I-I told yuh that if yuh stuck to it, you would be great, and-and, you know, I-I-you- you were sensational.
Yeah, I know. Just-just put on the watch, and-and... that thing, and we'll just...
You won t regret it... Tommy! Set Mr. Conlin up with four B.F. Goodrich G-Force T A s... ...and give him ten percent off for having the best costume...
Hi.
You look beautiful. Your hair...
I'm coming, baby -- How's Otis doing, anyway?
I have a better suggestion. Let's forget that the telephone ever rang. I never heard that you are Yakushova... you are Ninotchka... my Ninotchka...
All right, fight me, fight me as much as you want, but fight me tomorrow morning! There's nothing sweeter than sharing a secret with a bitter enemy.
Ninotchka, or shall I say Special Envoy Yakushova...
I'm scared. I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you. I don't want to lose...
I want my mommy. I don't want to lose you, Clem.
It's not erasing. He's off the screen.
Listen, it's not erasing.
For me? I don't think so. But I was hoping maybe you could do something for her --
Oh. Well, if there's anything I can do for you --
No, thank you, Mr. Sheldrake. As a matter of fact, I've got some money for you -- a hundred dollars --
Good. Is there anything you need -- money -- ?
Yes, she's in the shower -- she's coming along fine, considering.
I'd appreciate it if you'd be out of here as soon as you can.
Are you comfortable?
...Leon s not here. How did you get here? Phil doesn t know where I live.
Just kickin' back, I guess. I don't know. Jack and I were supposed to go golfing.
Okay! Jesus!
He had to make a phone call.
Hmmm.
Inconceivable!
Oh, sorry. Right this way.
What?! That is not allowed. My God, you are supposed to be one of us. You know you must never partake of Malkovich by yourself!
Oh, didn't anyone show you the indoctrination video?
You know I think it pays to leave juice-making to the trained professionals. You look terrible, my dear.
Hmmm, a lesbian, are you? I must inform you that I find that highly arousing.
Not even behind your back?
You thought wrong. I haven t seen Leon for months.
Yeah he got away. Come on let's go.
Haven t you? Then why the worried messages on his answering machine, Rhian? I d have sworn you expect him to be in trouble.
Jeanne, you are not helping yourself. If you don't answer our questions properly, your refusal will be taken into account.
Boy, it stunk in there.
It's a mosquito bite.
Need a lift?
Alright, I believe you. Stop crying. Your secret's safe with me.
I think he's telling the truth Valmont. Greg couldn't write a grocery list let alone a letter.
I swear on my life, I never said a word to her about you.
Come on Greg. You're the only one who knows her. The truth will save you.
Annette Harrison? I don't know what you're talking about.
You've never been here? Let me order for you.
Will you defy your father and your Queen?
It was your eyes. No, your lips.
She wants to inspect you. At Greenwich, come Sunday. Be submissive, modest, grateful and brief.
You did not like the speech?
Eh, fine.
Maude???!
I'm sorry. I was looking for Maude.
By giving liberty unto thine eyes; Examine other beauties. Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is; Shut up in prison, kept without my food, Whipp'd and tormented. Good day, good fellow.
I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit With Cupid's arrow; Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes, Nor open her lap to saint-seducing gold:
Do I have to stand here in the middle and meet them all?
I'm not sure I'd be good company tonight.
I think I'm being chased by a psychiatrist.
Vegas. Can you arrange that?
I've got almost everything we need! And this nice man...
No! They will be the judge of that! And so will I... if you shame me!
...Thanks.
I already stole it. Last week or whenever it was, in West Palm. I can't be stealing it again, can I?
You'd lie to protect him.
Yeah, but who's gonna believe Glenn? I mean, do you believe Glenn?
Twenty-two months, three days, two hours. Why?
Tell me something, Jack, how much longer you in here?
Doesn't have to figure out shit. You told him you keep 'em at your house.
It's a little late for me.
I was just thinking that I could use a guy like you, someone knows how to ask for things the right way. I'm talkin' about when you're outta here. I mean, you can't rob banks for ever.
And if you liked the person, you'd naturally persuade him to give it back and go straight, wouldn't you?
Well, that about covers everything.
Three sixes. Is that any good?
I don't understand what the hell's going on here, pop.
Ain't that hard, son. This young farmgirl, she got tired of all that attention goin' to her little brothers -- she fixed 'em. Just like 'ole Hazel Dobkins fixed her whole family -- except young Roxy here, she didn't use a wedding present. She used Daddy's razor.
What was the motive?
If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
You'll be sorry?
No further questions.
You heard me. Out of here.
Mr. McCleery?
Because I don't like you.
What for?
All right, boys -- I think you can get back to your rooms. I don't think we'll have any more of this agitation. Will we, Braddock?
See -- she's just having some water. Now there's no need for the cops or anything.
No, sir.
Perhaps I could drop round for tea or something?
If I met you for the first time today, I'd still want to be with you.
I remember thinking you were the one part of my life Buddy didn't have a piece of--
Yeah--
I guess we'll need another locker.
Sorry.
Hey, you know. I was thinking...
We'll have to rent a refrigerated truck for the beef and poultry.
Never heard of her.
I don t know... This is just a delivery place, man! I swear I don t know where the kids are... I work for Martin, that s all. Martin knows. He works for Friedman. He knows...
Your hair looks -- well fabulous.
Divine intervention.
Did you have anything to do with the riot in the laundry room?
Try to keep it to a minimum.
My body? I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed. Good night, Doc.
How'd they describe her?
You know, blonde, thin, whatever...
I dunno... something. Why is she doing this to me? Why?...
I don't know, but when we find her she's gonna die for it.
Ba-ll!
Not so fast! Slower... 'blonde, thin', yes... Did they say she had style? A kind of grace or anything?
I...I was gonna bring her to class next week. I wanted to hear your poem. Oh Vada, please honey I cared for him too, Vada please! Vada, Vada sweetheart don't.....
That's Suzanne. She and I are gonna be married this Fall.
I'm sure that every orgasm she had with me was faked.
I mean she only screwed me two or three times a night because she had to -- I'm sure she didn't enjoy it.
You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
What, darling?
Yeah --
Well, if you must know -- I fired my secretary, my secretary got to my wife, and my wife fired me. Ain't that a kick in the head?
You left your wife?
That's right. I've moved out of my house -- I'm going to be staying in town, at the Athletic Club.
You're going to take her off my hands?
I know how worried you were about Miss Kubelik -- well, stop worrying -- I'm going to take her off your hands.
Sir?
And I've got good news for you, Baxter. All your troubles are over.
It's about Miss Kubelik -- she's all right again -- so she went back home.
Now what was your news, Baxter?
Feel? I dunno... Happy.
We are not relating today, Harold. I sense a definite resistance. A lack of true and helpful communication. I find you a very interesting case, Harold, but this reluctance of yours is detrimental to the psycho-analytical process, and can only hinder the possibility of effective treatment. Do you understand?
Then why did you leave?
You know, I can't believe I did it. You think it'll work out?
Put it down!
Yes.
Get me the Radio Tower!
No. I'd have liked to.
I see. Tell me, Harold, do you remember your father at all?
Oh, and what did you do?
Very well... umm... I never expected to have to ask you this again... but how did our evening go? I remember getting to the casino... I remember kissing you... that was really nice but everything after that is a blank.
Very well. Now your mother tells me she is arranging several dates for you with some young ladies. How do you feel about that?
What do you mean?
What happened?
I was willing to shoot Captain Renault, and I'm willing to shoot you.
That's impressive. How did you do that?
Thanks...
Hello?
It is kinda romantic.
Yes, very.
Yes.
Lock the door.
I told you. We met yesterday.
I don't wanna talk to a teacher, it's summer!
At what?
Really?
Creed's great, ain't he... I'll do what I can.
If I show up at your door, chances are you did something to bring me there. I don't care about that stuff, anyway.
I wanted to be the host of Dance Fever, somethin' like that...
Yeah maybe you're right.
Mmm, hmmm. You shoulda seen how many people came to the airport to see me off. When I got drafted first it was the happiest day of my Father's life. He likes baseball more than I do...
You said "Crash".
You said "Crash".
I know but I....how much is it?
Yes I can't....I don't make enough money to be able to do that.
Mr. Henslowe, will you lend me fifty pounds?
Hot... These roads all round here, closed to the public... Why s that? Military bases? Huh. I guess there s space enough for war games... Must be good for business.
All those soldiers out there... getting bored, thirsty. Come out here for refreshment or female company perhaps?
Rod, get on the camel.
Honey, have they offered you the job?
I hate the friggin' game... I'd like to talk some business.
Don't matter -- That name. 'The Italian Stallion,' it's right on. Who discovered America? An Italian, right? So, man, what could be better than to get it on with one of his ancestors --
He won't last one round.
'The Italian Stallion' -- He's my man.
Southpaw, nuthin' -- I'll drop 'im in three -- 'Apollo Creed meets the Italian Stallion.' Shhiii -- Sounds like a damn monster movie!!
I usta be deadly at half-ball.
Listen, I gonna carry this boy three rounds, then drop 'im like a bad habit.
Jewelry?
I don't like you messin' with southpaws -- They do everything wrong.
All right gentlemen, let's get down to it. I need to know if you're for real.
--and The ass of The man who adores her.
Well yeah. Pretty much. I mean I Was no angel when we met but People change Doc. I mean sooner Or later you gotta grow up.
It's PG E saying to the judge that we don't have a case. Their lawyers go --
Yesterday.
Hey Doc! Come on now.
Oh please sod off.
Stay open. Who knows? Lightning could strike.
Like, that there's a point? An organic connection between all living things.
Then I started losing my taste for it. Which usually means your time is up. But then I realized it was something entirely different... I started getting the sneaking, dark suspicion that maybe there was... meaning to life.
I was leaving.
No.
No.
I need you.
No.
He told you he's failing in love with you? I've never known him to say those words before.
That's not his style. one thing I can say about Valmont. He always speaks the truth.
What?
I'll leave this afternoon. Happy?
Is there a mutual feeling between you two?
Well, what was yours?
Why?
Hey, this is it, the hour approach- es, I'm getting all excited. So what do you think, is it -- -- just the 'Executive Committee' or could you guys use me?
We experimented with hallucinogens. We used electro- shock to produce a vegetative state. We conducted terminal experiments in sensory deprivation.
It was crazy not to have destroyed them
And what of these foreigners?
Some Americans?
I don't understand it, there were a lot of people there last night, many Americans, I believe we should move carefully.
Yo, you gonna show, Tony?
I think the pilot that shot down the Libyan in 1981 is stationed right here. Maybe you could get him -- and maybe Tom should say that our F-14 is one of the hardest planes to fly. They're nicknamed 'Tomcats'.
George Weln is at the Pentagon where the attack launched by the lone Libyan pilot has resulted in a massive movement of military might.
How much time do we have?
Oh, Buzz is pretty harmless, really --
At least tell them I'm trying! Tell 'em something--!
You do, huh? Stick around. Don't go on any long trips.
Well we'd love to, but we're going to another party.
Oh, say, how would you kids like to stop off for a drink?
Where to, Les?
Give me a little credit for doing this face-to-face! What I went through knowing I was going to do this to my mentor! Can you get past yourself for a second?
Dick.
You wanted smaller.
You'll lose.
Jerry --
I'm over it. Now I want all my clients and yours too.
You'll always be my hero, Jerry. Always always always. We're bringing other elements in, we're focusing on endorsements -- it's not about handholding anymore. We're no longer babysitters --
-- and I'll get 'em.
Yes. I do.
Do you?
Why do you wanna know so bad?
I bought a ticket. I've come to see the film.
What are you doing here?
In the van.
Which is--
Next time I'll use valet parking.
I'm not real big on collecting banged up Ferraris at airports.
They work off the O2 tank just like the slice pack.
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already.
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it?
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again! I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office.
You jivin' me?
Huh?
Man, we sure hit the jackpot fast around here.
Ain't that something?! That's just fine, baby.
How come you keep askin'?
Thousand dollars a game.
You'll have to prove it. This is a great brownie and I'm going to fight for it. State your claim.
Ya gettin 150 grand killer. Ya got any plans for it? Whatta ya think? Ya like to put it on the street, make it work for ya?
I don t know. I don t know, man. I don t even know Friedman that well... I... Man, you ve got to get me out of here...
What is Tir Asleen?
Did you have my home phone number?
Julie?... Hey, you are a looker.
Yup.
Kiss me once, Amy! Kiss me once for luck!
Just something I'm trying.
Each day is better than the next. Have you ever been, you know... in love with someone?
Nah.
It must be great with a wife like that.
Mary again.
Look, I admit it was brief, but it was definitely love. Crushes don't last twelve years.
Never?
Well once. Mary.
Whatever happened to Mary?
I told you, her family moved to Miami.
Where is she? Tell me!
You look great.
Sorry. I was just trying to be nice.
I'd like to sit with my uh wife if you don't mind.
What's the idea?
Yeah. Come on come on!
Hey, you!
Huh?
Eighty dollars.
Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
Hello, Dorothy.
Promise me you'll read those contracts by then.
If you don't, one of those guys will.
You know how to drive a stick?
I'll call you a cab. If you want the clothes, pack them up.
Vivian... I'm sorry. I wasn't prepared for questions about us. It was an idiotic and insensitive thing I did. I should have known that it would hurt you.
This is no time to disappear. We're in too far.
Take charge of him. Get him a suite at the Imperial and hire some bodyguards.
Oh, he's moved out?
The room s yours for 24 hours. It s sound- proofed, stocked up with food, drink and other things you might find useful. You can do anything you like.
You didn't not see me long enough to miss me.
No.
And not show it to me. Ever again.
I have to do some research tomorrow.
Like, uh...?
No, but that don't mean much. I was a completely different person ten years ago. Let's give key lime a day in court. And a large glass of milk.
Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
You mean spies and things like that?
Charles Lampert's widow -- yes? Last time I sent out a tie only the spot came back.
Have some, please. I've got... ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
There's another one we owe 'em.
How 'bout a glass of water?
When the hell did you write that?
Shit Honey, you could've told me. People might think it's about us!
Ooh, well excuse me.
Please believe me. I was even on the verge of telling you last night, but...
Well, that'll happen.
Aren't they precious? Ma'am, she has a substantial death benefit coming to her from the tragic loss of her husband. Does she have any relatives in the area?
Yeah. Goodnight, Emily.
But... to be honest... I don't think they'll leave tomorrow.
What're you doing here?
See if they'll what?
Oh yeah! Put it in your mouth!
That was a great night.
Rusty's dead. That's Ajax
Damon Bradley? That's why you're here?
I mean, if it's a problem...
Mr. President...
Look, maybe I m not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. A little flirtation s harmless but you re playing with fire here. The Fidelity Bank and Trust is a tough creditor. You make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.
It's freezing up here, Beefy.
It's nothing serious. I'll just run into that building. They'll have some sort of first aid kit.
Hey, is that really necessary?
Screw the rules. I m talking about the choice.
Makin' friends already.
All I m saying it there isn t a guy in Union County who wouldn t give his left nut to be married to Kate...
I wish you'd tell me.
So what are you gonna do?
That's my fault, not hers. I've got to keep practicing. I'm still in the learning stage but magic, Madmartigan, requires concentration and--
Faith, this is my mother.
It's not gonna be easy. Your brothers can possess people. So they probably won't look like themselves. You have to be suspicious of everyone.
Is the poverty worse, now, you think?
I just need to find my brothers and be on my way, Beefy.
Well, you were right about what that bartender said.
Leave. Take this shit back to Detroit and get the rest of our money.
What do your instincts tell you to do now, kid?
...but that's not what we're gonna do, is it?
We could do that. I could be on my way to Florida, and you could go to Thailand and fuck your brains out.
It's to follow my instincts. And my instincts say get the fuck out of Dodge.
No... if we don't finish this job, how are we gonna look at ourselves in the mirror? This is it for me, Wesley, she's the last one. My instinct says I gotta see this through with her, and if there's one thing I've tried to teach you here --
No, I said to follow 'my' instincts. Now, we go up there and conclude our business. Case closed.
A Ford! A Ford! Goddamnit, a Ford! That's great!
I have a question...
Why are we speaking Chinese?
You're doing a pretty sloppy job of it. Here's your ticket.
O'Grady.
We just come from the bank.
What did he pay you, Mimi, to stick to that story?
You're lying, Mimi. But then, you'd do anything for money. You're getting a good price for saying you saw Wynant and you figure you won't get anything if he's dead.
Macaulay, you drew up Wynant's will. Mimi was cut off, wasn't she, if she re-married?
Okay, let's cut it.
You shouldn't let that keep you from telling truth, Mimi. Mrs. Jorgensen - Were you ever divorced from Chris Jorgensen?
That's McDermott, but yeah.
Andrew Mc-dair-mo?
Yes.
Don't get any ideas. Of course it comes out of your share.
What do you want from me, Catherine?
What's it about?
Why does he do it?
When did you write it?
Then you'll be all set.
Different charge. I had a still. Made my own mescal.
Clarence sent a letter?
Is that so?
Moreau? C est moi. Alors...
So I've heard--
Me neither.
The letter I sent.
Where?
You're not going to phone anybody where I am.
Here, give it to me.
You didn't have to chase me so hard --
Yes -- that's right. Production for use.
And that's all the gratitude I get for saving your hide.
I'm sorry I thought you were the murderer, Adam -- how did I know that he was as big a liar as you are?
I said, tell me to go to the --
All right, prove it to me -- tell me to go to the Embassy first thing in the morning and turn in those stamps.
Don't move!
Alabama, could you tell Clar -
Ask him if he got the letter.
All right. These are the choices: microwave ovens, pocket calculators, Walkmans, digital watches and miniature TV's.
What are you talking about?
It's more involved than that.
I don't know.
Is this what you want -- huh? Is it?
... to love your enemy as much as you love yourself?
Yes, but you, you do care about me.
Your guilt is because you feel the same.
How come I didn't hear anything?
How are we doing? My name is O'Neill. And you are...?
Thanks for the shower.
Check the permits. It was built as a guesthouse. It's a legally rentable unit grandfathered when South Laguna was incorporated.
I like this case.
Yup.
You did it.
That's the spirit.
I put in months of quality time with Vicky. Sherman meets a chick for one night and scores? This is just wrong.
Come in, Alfredo.
Exactly what is your previous experience?
Nothing. I just watch till something strikes me. Do anything you think of -- try different thing. Until I say, "hold that pose." Then just try and comfortably hold it.
You paying for the gas?
How much style?
Seventy-two five. Why do you want this barley pop so bad?
Last year, this was a new rig.
You're going to look for him -- now?
It stands to reason you are telling the truth -- for why would you invent such a ridiculous story?
Ahh.
Everest. Is that right?
That's fair.
...I'm thrilled. As you know, uh... uh, on my agent's advice I sold out, and I'm gonna do an appearance on TV.
Where are you, ol' buddy?
I want you to know how much I love you. That you've given a meaning to my life that I had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.
Hello.
David Kessler, this is Gerald Bringsly.
Gerald is the man you murdered in the subway. We thought it best you didn't see him as he's a fresh kill and still pretty messy.
What about the zoo?
I didn't mean it. I don't know what I'm saying. I'm not even sure it was me who killed those people. I don't remember doing it.
No problem. Just make sure your front door is unlocked. Shall we say the "stroke of midnight" no pun intended?
Outstanding.
Don't think it's not going to cost you.
I don't know. I haven't caught anything yet.
Oh, you couldn't be more wrong, sweetheart. I can' tell you how much I appreciate it and how I'm looking forward to it.
I know you do, darling.
What, honey?
Why not?
Diane takes care of the books. I don't know how, but at the end of every month, everything adds up to the penny.
What did you want a gun for?
Hello Mickey. We've never been introduced, but I'm Wayne Gayle. I don't know if you've ever heard of me or remember me. I was one of the reporters outside the courthouse during your trial---
Oh. Nothing, really, just... the more timid investors are no longer running for cover.
Sid found me the icepack.
Thanks. People seem to be pretty hot over this imbecile story.
Oh, it isn't your fault, Amy. You're the one person who's been standing by me through all this.
I know that, Amy.
Say, he's a friend of mine.
How does she draw?
A little hot.
And a glass.
Would you like to sit down, Joe?
Anything else, Mr. Black? How about some water?
Why yes, thank you.
The Board of Parrish Communications - is hereby called to order. Our sole order of business is an acceptance of John Bontecou's generous offer and --
Do you have any more of these deli- cious cookies?
Nice to see you. I didn't expect you, but certainly you can't get enough of a good thing.
Says you were a slob, leaving trails of panties and dirty socks in your wake.
This may be a little rough - you'd better let us go alone.
Sure I like her.
Wood's okay. I want Viper.
Don't be greedy. Stay with Wood.
What what are you doing? We're cover!
I'm gonna take him, Goose.
You live in a place, you should know something about it. Explore--
Gibarian was under enormous --
Like what?
Hello.
Finally! So you're our Canadian pickpocket?
As the wife of one of our party.
I understand you were in Africa. Whereabouts?
Oh, all over.
Somethin', though.
I don't know.
What is it you got between you?
She knows where I live and breathe. She's coming after me.
I got tired of being played with.
No, sir. You won't. There's smoke off yonder on the horizon. They're gonna want your badge.
Nothin' I'll be okay, pop.
What's goin' down, son?
I'm too weak. The process has already begun.
So go get 'em, Jimmy!
Sure, pop. Whatever you want.
We gotta get this bad boy burning again. Ideas?
To do that Cassius and Adrian have to come back through the other way.
So go get 'em, Dad!
Gear shift.
Hey relax, I'm not gonna break it.
Ah no.
What.
Steering wheel.
What.
I'm not gonna break it, I just wanna see it change colors.
Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
Goodbye, Sam.
I'm not gay.
What are you talking about?
It's freakish. I don't get it. I'm not really supposed to touch you, but I can look.
Why isn't that a good time to quit?
You're driving me crazy! Do you know what it's like trying to jack-off in an armoire?
I'm not being unpatriotic, and I'm doing my damndest to catch them. Bell's up on 80 and I'm down here on 70 past Grand Junction. They're heading west. If they're not flying we have a damn good chance of getting them. All I'm asking is that you people think about it.
Is that what's affecting your performance?
I'll make this as simple as I can, George. They disappeared.
We're growing very concerned back here. There's no use pretending otherwise. We're rapidly approaching a 'condition red.' People are beginning to ask difficult questions.
George, listen to what you're saying. This thing's changed itself into a man. Disappearing may not be that big a deal.
I don't care where you're from you just can't disappear into thin air.
Maybe... look, this is just something to think about... from what I got at the shopping center, it was more scared than anything else... I don't feel it's as big a threat as you think it is...
So far you've let it cross the heart of America. For two days it has been absorbing information that is detrimental to our security. I don't see the humor in that.
I can't get with any religion that advertises in Popular Mechanics. Look- there's God coming outta the men's room.
I can think of another word.
Tsch, a few.
Are you?
Really? It must be a tremendous hem.
Least I'm not down there herding sheep!
What for?
Well, I got it all planned... and I'm taking Holly off with me.
I've got a gun here, sir. It's always a good idea to have one around.
Hi.
If that's what feels right.
Oh, yes, you have!
Relax. We'll drop the song.
It's a shitty song.
Susie. It's one more show. One more time. That's all.
Practice. There are worse songs, you know. Not many, but a few.
Whoa.
Come on, do you think I'm doing the right thing? Tell the truth. You've been through it.
Well, you waited for good reason, and you proposed to Christine for some good reason. So I think it's great. It's time. You've got to have your eyes open, that's all. I mean, look at me. I thought Victoria and I were set for life.
...the fuck is this...
Went home to shit.
Hey, where's Finch?
What reputation?
I think she said her name was 'Flintstone.'
I mean, what are the three terrors of the Fire Swamp? One, the flame spurts. No problem. There's a popping sound preceding each, we can avoid that. Two, the Lightning Sand. But you were clever enough to discover what that looks like, so in the future we can avoid that too.
Now, was that so terrible? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 64.
And then double it -- and that is the -- what can I say -- git I'm living with and he cannot remember...
What will you say?
To who?
Both of 'em?
Oh, dear that's too bad. -- get her out of here, get her out of here.
Not in Houston. We'd be better off in some place more out of the way.
I'll meet you, Marietta, if that's what you want, but I'm against it.
Marietta, I was just gonna leave and see if I could pick up their trail.
Under a hundred.
Listen, I don't know your name, but what are you doing for lunch?
Mm.
Well, I feel better about this now.
It's kind of late.
Not much point to this, is there?
Bree -- thanks -- I don't want to.
Lady Viola is young in the world. Your Majesty is wise in it. Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.
From the day I started...to today. Can't stand it.
No love.
Maybe you should. Think about it. Those who can afford our goods do their thing without upsetting anyone. Those who can t do it to kids from the streets or their own family and it makes upsetting headlines.
Maybe I don t.
Adult education is such junk! The professors are so phony. How can you do it?
You said, "Will it change..." Wife. Will it change...
I do sort of live with somebody though.
Um, no.
Yeah, yeah. It goes "Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?
That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- The police will want his description. Is this a picture of him?
All of 'em.
And if you don't give me a plane that can handle combat, you better start learning to speak German.
The struts are loose, the hydraulics are leaking, and the electrical system's shorting out in the cockpit.
So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? There's still a chance we'll get back together?
Your honeymoon would've never been this exciting.
Christ, what channel are we on?...
You've been under a lot of pressure lately -
Yeah, they told me.
Can you get me on a flight Thursday night?
You get fifty a day, period. It's a business trip, they'll pay for your expenses.
Yeah, but does she swallow, Edwin?
So, Edwin, baby, this is Sunrise Confession time... what have you got for us?
Yeah, I know the place. It's one of those chic yuppie gathering holes.
Does anybody know I'm here?
Out Loud?
Boy. I had a feeling today was going to be the day... Helicopter.
Yeah... Ditto. I saw, er, I thought I saw you get munched... like Uncle Terrence...
Okay, friend. Start running.
Name is Carruthers. Believe I shoot people every now and then. Not that I deserve a medal.
You think that's what McDermott was raving about in the ambulance?
Serafine...?
He's not coming to take us for a ride, either. Come on, let's make a run for the car.
I'll tell you a story. It's about this shy copy editor who makes a mockery of herself and her boss when she completely botches her first assignment as a reporter.
No- not really, Josie. NOT REALLY. How could you do that to me? I helped you. I got you everything you wanted. And how do you repay me- you blow everything TWO DAYS before pro scouts come to see me play. Once they had seen me really play- they wouldn't have given a shit about my age.
Oh, he's good! Great, actually. I saw him do "Tru" with his sixty foot Robert Morse puppet. Sensational.
What kind of circumstances?
The Great Mantini?
Is there dancing?
How'd it go? Did you say the philodendron gets water or no?
Who needs dancing?
Here we are, folks--eighty thousand wild-eyed fans go mad--they go mad as Chad Denby--with the arms of iron, and the nerves of steel--picks up his racket-- What is this thing--a racket or a mallet?
I wonder what's eating that old money-grubbing buzzard anyway?
What do you mean, and be bored to death?
Everything was during Betty. God we were so young. Why did we think we had to do it all so fast? I've never cheated on Betty. Not once we were married, I mean.
--you want to adopt him!--Good for you!
Hello.
Yes.
What would you say to a short one? Bourbon still your drink?
Now listen -- this was not my idea. It was my father's idea.
Look, we'll go out to dinner and have a drink and I'll bring her back. Because it was either that or a dinner party for the two families. And I'm afraid I couldn't quite handle that, if you don't mind. I have no intention of ever taking your precious daughter out again in her life. So don't get upset about it.
I don't know why, but every time he opens his mouth I want to punch him out.
His idea? Gimme a break. Fuckin' guy's got a vacant lot for a head. Was you and me figured the whole thing out.
Why you brought Glenn into this, I'll never know.
Great, let's break for lunch and I'll buy you a beer on the way.
He ain't the problem, Jack.
Sounds good. Oblique but intriguing. Phone it in.
I see. Are you unhappy at our little company?
No sir, not at all. It's just that I'm going to open my own business and...
More beet-spinach juice, my friend?
No thank you sir. It's delicious, though. I just wanted to thank you for the opportunity to work at LesterCorp, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to tender my resignation effectively immediately.
The vacant office. I see. Olive oil. Interesting. Be warned, Schwartz, there are certain doors which should never be opened.
And what sort of business will this be? If you don't mind my asking.
Uh, import-export. Olive oil. Right on 7 1 2 actually. In the vacant office. So we'll still be seeing each other.
Elaine, I mean the mission has to be aborted. This ship should never have passed FSA inspection. This thing is held together by string and chewing gum.
Well, I haven't fought just one person for so long. I've been specializing in groups. Battling gangs for local charities, that kind of thing.
Saw my mom... I'm with Debi, and I'm on my way to the reunion.
Elaine, we have to go back.
It s my job.
Married?
Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39.
No? Brothers to the bone, right?
Came here to fire you, Jerry.
...it just....I don't know....I don't know.
Um....I bought one. I thought maybe it would be nice to get dressed for work, can I show you something?
....yes.....
I don't know. I think it's a piano....a small piano.
That's not a piano.....I have a piano at home.....where'd you get it?
Why is it here? Barry....Barry?
Just move with me. Don't think.
I had to say something to get you here.
Probably best. It'll be all business and politics, that sort of thing. Wouldn't interest you. Good of you to come.
No thanks. I'm heading back.
Time for my coach to turn back into a pumpkin.
You're still my best girl, Cora.
What'd you do to your hair?
What are you doing here?
Yeah...
I'd miss my life...
It wouldn't work.
"For"...?
How long you going away for?
Well, just don't expect Oz to pay for the limo.
Boys.
Forget it.
I'd like to tell you that we all grow out of it, but that's a lie. Some of us will always be rattling cages.
Stifler, fuck -- ...man, you don't have to be so insensitive.
I begin to believe in it myself since I've met you. I still don't know what to make of it. It confuses me, it frightens me a little, but it fascinates me, Ninotchka.
Ni-notchka.
Ninotchka, do you like me just a little bit?
Thank you.
Your cornea is terrific. Tell me -- you're so expert on things -- can it be that I'm falling in love with you?
A very convenient guy -- this superintendent. Have you checked his bank deposits lately?
Jeff -- huh?
Who said they left then?
Who left -- where?
Now how could anybody guess that? They had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "Grand Central Or Bust!"?
The superintendent met Thorwald coming back. He said Thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.
The Thorwalds -- at six in the morning?
The building superintendent, and two tenants. Flat statements -- no hesitation. And they all jibed to the letter. The Thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.
Where does he go?
How can I possibly thank you?
They called me up to the Show and I wanta tell Crash goodbye.
You weren't looking for company, were you?
You got more than one?
The freighter started through at 1:42. The sea water seeped into Carl's watch and stopped it. At 1:47.
Ten?
You got a little girl?
Listen, folks, it's a fact that I didn't write the letter, but this whole thing started
What difference does that make?
No, I didn't write it, but
What do you care anyway? You don't even like Christine.
What? Of course I like Christine.
You said she was shallow. Yeah, and a nouveau riche.
That was three years ago after that first party!
This is totally different. I'm talking about avoiding what you're talking about. That's the distinction. I have not made the commitment yet. I am not married. I have not said the words. In a few days, I might get married, and if I do, then I won't be doing stuff like this anymore. Otherwise, what's the whole point of getting married?
And what about Stephanie? She's a woman -- with a kid. A single mom. What do you think she's looking for? Huh?
Here's what I'm thinking. We move up here, you and me, buy a vineyard. You design your own wine; I'll handle the business side. Then you get inspired and write a new novel. As for me, if an audition comes along, hell, LA'S two hours away. Not even.
You're crazy. You've gone crazy.
Look, Miles, all I know is I'm an actor. All I have is my instinct. My intuition -- that's all I have. And you're asking me to go against it. And that's just wrong.
You're gonna have to kill me to keep me away from Lula.
So?
Whattya mean?
You're out of your mind.
How much do you make a week?
Thank you.
Well, I really don't drink...
Look, the ice is melting.
More than fourteen thousand marks... were in that pocketbook.
There is no pocketbook here... On the floor probably.
Fourteen thousand marks... One can travel -- one's happiness might depend on fourteen thousand marks -- don't you think so, Baron?
Stay where you are.
Oh, I've got to find it.
Thank you.
How do you do, Mr. Matuschka?
Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
Look, I love you Katka but I'm twelve years older, I could never marry you, it'd be stupid, you know that!
No, I love you, really.
I have been feasting with mine enemy, where on a sudden one hath wounded me, that's by me wounded; both our remeidies within thy help and holy physic lies.
Then plainly know my hearts dear love is set, on the fair daughter of rich Capulet. We met, we wooed, we made exchange of vow. I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray, that thou consent to marry us today.
The last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
Rosaline? My ghostly father no; I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
What's going on?!
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
Uh-huh...
Television or movies?
Dorothy might love me or not, as she likes, but Best will have to fight me before he marries her!
Neither do I, baby.
This is a pretty way to recommend yourself to the family.
The man that marries Dorothy Dugan must first kill me -- do you mind that?
I'll call you.
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
What do you think?
I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
One of those outside agitators.
What?
I hate that. I won't stand for it.
Oh -- no sir.
You'll talk when I'm finished!
You get the girl.
What's the worst?
One-third? That's about 7,000,000 isn't it?
Mrs. Semple is entitled to one- third of the estate.
Imagine that - holding the ends of my pants!
Yes, sir.
Get up from there. I don't want anybody holding the ends of my pants. Get up from there!
Why, I'm assisting you, sir.
Excuse me. What did you say?
And don't ever get down on your knees again, understand?
Mrs. Semple is entitled by law to one-third of the estate.
I don't know. Maybe...
Is that tonight?
You think I like being here on Christmas Eve, Alan?
You're right, Jack. Sorry... Jack approaches Alan.
My apologies. Do you regret not telling the truth?
Give us a break. All you have to do is make a phone call.
I advise you to let us go.
BINGO! Tell the man what he's won!
Fag..a fag you say!?... "Curst wolf! Thy fury inward on thyself Pray and consume thee!"
Ha, ha, ha, ha rubbish...now begone...before somebody drops a house on you!...
Excuse me.
They drive so recklessly there.
I'm curious. The D-6 that was refitted into the deceased's well. Was it exactly the same brand and model as defendant's?
What doesn't?
You gaff with the hook end. Blood's on the butt. Where your hand goes.
Sure you did. Help me with this hold cover, willya?
My gosh, Alvin, was I supposed to object every time you did that?
Willow...this may be a bad time to ask this question but...what if Raziel's wrong?
Richard. Hi.
A fine choice, sir.
Sorry it took me so long on the phone. But we're all set.
Happy New Year.
You know me with girls. Easy come, easy go. Goodbye, Doc.
I know it's a drag -- but you can't find a hotel room in town -- not on New Year's Eve.
I rented a car -- it's going to be here at one o'clock -- we're driving to Atlantic City.
I didn't plan it this way, Fran -- actually, it's all Baxter's fault.
This is me breating.
No, 'fraid not.
Bollocks, bollocks, bollocks. Have you seen my glasses?
Edward, did you hear me?
Objection, asking the witness to speculate.
I'm Daffy.
Stay with me tonight. Not because you're being paid to. Stay with me because you want to.
You're both going to a lot of trouble-- Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do you expect to pull this off?
...Shrewd.
I get the robe an' Paulie gets three grand.
Don't you care what the people will say?
Yeah. A billion. Right... How are you?
Yeah, sure...
Hey Charlie.
Uh...yes, at the moment.
You promised to give it back.
You trust me, don't you? Just give it to me for a second.
I need it.
In your pocket. Give it to me.
My gun?
You want to give me your gun now, Plato?
What do you think?
I promise nothing'll happen if you do. You want my jacket? It's warm.
No.
Carl. Friend of yours from high school. Everybody calls him "Cueball."
I was awake and he was in my room.
Good.
Will you be here in about fifteen minutes?
Alex?
It's nice to see you.
No...
No...
I walked out the door. There's no more memory.
You dipshit, you're expecting to score with some goody-goody choir-girl priss?
I love you.
Me?
I'm scared.
I can't be certain that you would. But what have you got to lose?
Good, good, good... you'll enjoy it, you'll see. Julian is a gentleman.
I'm just a complete moron. Sorry. This is the sort of thing that happens in dreams -- not in real life. Good dreams, obviously -- it's a dream to see you.
It's going to be great --
There's a dip at this end. And since when do flowers grow shorter in two weeks?
And digging in. Look at that flower bed.
I know. But there's one important change. The flowers in Thorwald's pet flower bed.
Well?
Now don't give me a hard time.
Your soul...? Why should I bother with such a paltry trifle?
What is she doing? Okay, 20 .
We're getting that anyway.
Sam! Do me a speech, do me a line.
I'll give you 10 of the door if you don't play.
You love him, don't you?
Oh, baby, what's going on?
Yeah.
Oh, Tangerine.
I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
Out.
His rug.
My bed, gone! Am I to freeze to death?
-- okay -- -- I'll see you later. Your house.
She's heavy. See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
Come up here a minute.
-- Tonight he forgot.
Leave me alone.
No.
No.
Sure it is. You want to bug us till we have to lock you up. Why?
Big tough character. You don't kid me, pal. How come you're not wearing your boots?
Too bad you didn't connect. You could have gone to Juvenile Hall. That's what you want, isn't it?
Hang loose, boy. I'm warning you.
Wash up and go home.
Grandma?
Get lost.
Not ready? Where is she?
Yeah. I'm registered for this class.
What class?
Yeah, we'll just see about that, won't we?
Yup. Usually working on my bike. No big deal. If it doesn't work out, you can send 'em back to the chicken fat lady.
Hard to tell what's shakin' in a place like this, honey. You don't want to be walkin' in the wrong door.
Easy, Virge, they're just tryin' To egg us on.
Huh?
Count it.
Jack...
Uh ... You don't know when you'll be wanting us back, do you, Lloyd?
Uh, well, you know, the way our schedule is, I thought maybe...
Count the fucking money, Frank.
Was it you?
Right.
I suppose I might have told one or two people down the pub.
Blimey. What's that?
Well, thanks, that's great.
Sometimes we sell them to McDonald's and just change them to special barbecue sauce.
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.
Maybe this can wait.
Yeeeess!!!
No, I didn't.
Do you realize that I work at him?
Did you... do something to him?
Well, that's a load off.
No... actually, I even shut the phone off and put a little piece of cardboard in the ringer so no one can just buzz me from d...
Do you like to be interrupt when you are danging around in your little garden?
I know.
I can't believe he'd do this.
Across the street. She went into the park and got turned around and didn't know her way out.
They say it hit both sides of his brain... Even if he makes it he's gonna be a vegetable.
I want you to turn out the light in the rear entrance. It might attract the police.
You're good.
Yes, sir!
Don't you think we should get some tools, maybe?
But this is public property.
Oh, wait, Maude. Look!
You ever think back to how you started.
Yes, I will.
Exactly how do you mean?
Yes I am.
Yes, sir.
Mr. McQuire.
Let fate decide? What're you, the fuckin' Dali Lama now?
Coming!
Tell me something, Buddy. You know anyone who's actually done one last big score and gone to live the good life? Cause it occurred to me that everyone talks about doing it, but I don't know anyone who's actually gone and done it. Do you?
Looking for intelligent life?
They said find it. Find her, find it. Finish the job you were paid to do.
Well, that's fine --
You can't know that for sure.
We're going to lose.
Who?
It's questionable whether there's any advantage to be had from that direction. She's never been less popular.
Mrs Brown.
She's refusing to leave Balmoral.
In the press, perhaps. But she's sold more copies of her Highland Journal in three months than Punch will ever sell in a year. Time to wheel her out.
The Princess Louisa is too ill to move. Frankly, the Queen's rather upset at the recent spate of bad publicity. You're smiling.
What's her excuse this time?
So?
He doesn't seem to hold a grudge. What I want to know is why, they got such a big score up north, did Foley hang around Miami for so long? Any thoughts on that one?
What cha say, Benny -- Meet 'The Rock.' This is our cutman, Benny Stein.
I'm all for them owning casinos, getting rich off the white man's greed. It's a beautiful piece of irony, isn't it, Wesley?
Check the eyes, Ben.
Roger, enough with the fucking donuts! What did I tell you. Stop bothering Mickey, and get behind your nagra.
Okay. Sure. My grandfather. When he was seven, he shook the hand of an old guy, a war vet or something, who had once shaken President Lincoln's hand. Made a big impression on him.
We're having the wedding sometime near the end of the summer.
I fall asleep at the wheel.
What are you talking about? It s me, Jack Campbell. Penthouse C. I put you into commercial paper!
Thank you, Betty. I know if I can just sleep this off, I ll be fine...
There's a chocolate cream filled in there?
My sister believes in fate, but not hell. That's why she stopped praying for the lost souls since you don't hear that much about purgatory anymore. But every day she asks her boss to pray I don't fuck up. Whatta you think, you think there's a hell, Jack?
B-Black...
What colour is your car? What colour is your car?
I think television's a dangerous thing.
Hey. The neighbors.
Well, actually, she looks better than that.
What about the staff? They re in on what s going on, aren t they? How many of them?
No.
You ever going to bed?
Not right now.
Boss, ain't you going to bed?
Why not act the role of heroines instead? Queen Esther from the Bible, or St. Joan?
Where's his body?
Yes?
So I want you to keep a clear head.
Now, wait a minute. I know what you're thinking -- but it's not as bad as it looks -- MATUSCHKA It's none of my business what you do, Fran -- you're over twenty- one -- but your sister happens to think you're a lady.
What do you think?
Yeah, they hit the calf over the head with a mallet and then Luisa hits it again in the kitchen.
I'm curious, but I don't want to know. Jeez, I hope you haven't been telling people what's going to happen to them.
Well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.
So what? Do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?
Sometimes which?
Some... What does that mean?
I don't like sex. I don't think I'll be having sex ever again.
Frank wasn't 'there.
Shhh. Shhhhh.
We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. Are you ready?
Uh... she was wearing a kind of... a flouncy kind of... uh... plain...
And this? Some of their handiwork?
Jack, Jack, it's dwarves live here. Hard-working chaps. Hammering in the forge all the live-long day. Make the most wondrous things, they do.
That would be Devil's Needle. Last landmark I know in these woods.
Good.
Screwball! Be quiet...! We have friends live 'neath the Needle. They'll no doubt provide safe refuge for the night.
Twould appear other travelers precede us.
Beyond Devil's Needle, all is unknown.
I trust our own welcome will be more hospitable.
Nay, Jack, tis not what you're thinking.
Is that what your girlfriend does for you?
How would you like to be yourself for the day?
We're a team. We work together.
What's the problem?
Yeah. And I thought everyone liked Eddie.
Not exactly, sugar... One reason we're in all the trouble we're in right now is cause of what I was doin'... I tried to tell you this before...
You know, Lula, I never told you what all I was doin' before I met you.
Oh God... OH GOD... Santos... Oh God Marietta... are you in on this?... OH GOD!!!
I can't. The police have it by now.
No.
Hello.
So you'll be at work?
What would you be doing now?
I'd be in Tahoe having fun if you had given up.
If I asked you to stop, would you?
Getting high, I guess.
I was never very good at it, remember?
But Maude, you don't understand. I love you. Do you hear me? I've never said that to anyone in my life before. You're the first. Maude. Please don't leave me.
But why now?
Never! Never! I'll never forget you. I wanted to marry you. Don't you understand! I love you. I love you!
It's true. I can't live without you.
I'm sorry, Bill --
Susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? Well, I'm sorry, apology not accepted.
I think you heard me, Bill.
You're not taking Susan anywhere. And what the hell does that mean anyway?
I'm in love with your daughter, and I'm taking her with me tonight.
You're what?
-- And I'm in love with your daughter.
Say again?
Hello, sweatheart. Come on up.
Isn't she the sweetest goddamned girl you ever saw in your whole life? Is she a four alarm fire, or what?
I love her, Bill. She is all that I ever wanted, and I've never wanted for anything because I've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.
How perfect for you -- to take whatever you want because it pleases you. It's not love --
Stephanie! Stop!
Neither could I. I think it's Bukowski.
Half my life is over, and I have nothing to show for it. I'm a thumbprint on the window of a skyscraper. I'm a smudge of excrement on a tissue surging out to sea with a million tons of raw sewage.
I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
I can explain.
Crown Victoria. F.B.I. car. A legitimate tail.
Flat, wraparound headlights?
Change lanes. Then watch your rearview.
People more serious about their work. You know how to drive this thing or do you just like looking good in it?
I noticed.
No. Why? Are you seducible?
You think for once we could talk about something besides basketball?
It's possible.
What?
What's up?
Wait. I want to tell you something.
Uhhh, va, uhh, Vada.
All sound reasons for matrimony.
Thank you.
Well, nice meeting you, Jenna, Christa. Would it be okay if I called you Mommy?
Well, Mommy, get me to the big apple cause I'm gonna rock that town like a hurricane.
What 're you talking about?
Kids are not your thing, Deborah. You d have been ready for me when I turned up with Sleeping Beauty . Damn it! Then too I should have paid more attention. Not Leon, you said. It struck me at the time, but obviously not hard enough. You didn t say My God! , or whatever else well-bred ladies squeak on hearing Uncle Henry misbehaved. Not Leon. Who then? You sure were right about one thing, Deborah, the job was too formidable for me. I should have thought a little more before I left for Los Angeles. But there I was focused so hard on Friedman I d stopped thinking. Nothing added up - Leon soliciting money for prints while buying kids at 15,000 a go; infiltrating the world of child traffickers; duping Friedman into selling him a little boy... You sure were right. The job was too formidable for me. But you knew that, didn t you?
I'm De...
Well, that's the doggonedest thing . . . I haven't heard anything out of that ear since I was a kid. Must have been that jump in the cold water.
In the car.
I see what you mean.
Now, let's say the whole country. Was in that car. The entire United States of America.
In the car?
Well, let's say your mother was in the car and you had to get her to a hospital. You'd do it then for sure wouldn't you?
Well... I gues I would... Yeah.
You know, on an empty road where you know it's safe and nobody's around...
He was murdered.
Gilfond's okay, except he thinks Hemingway's great Literature.
Four kids, three different guys.
Huh?
He's a fisherman! The most overrated writer of the century. I mean, he's the perfect American author fat, violent, drunk...
But you know, you shit out a bunch of kids, you're going to put on a few pounds.
I'd say about a deuce, deuce and a half. Not bad.
Nope. Never been.
So she's married?
No, not at all.
That I couldn't say. Let me ask you something: Was she a little big-boned in high school?
Mary's a little chubby, huh?
Well she must've packed on a few pounds over the years.
Go breaker.
Hello.... oh, just a minute. Police department?
Could I ask you to move? I'm sorry - but when you turn, the sheets, I can't really bear the sheets moving over me. Sorry.
Ownership. Being owned. When you leave, you should forget me.
I can beat him.
Look at me. These aren't lungs. These are... Tanks. How long can you hold your breath?
I have to go back . . .to the Fortress . . .
Here are her diaper rags. And this is her milk bladder. And when she cries--she's either hungry or she's tired--rock her on your left shoulder. She likes that.
Well put. So, what exactly has uncle Terrence been up to lately?
What?
Hey, Sorry if I was out of line.
I stopped that!
I am not.
I told you i'll get in trouble.
What do you want? My mom will skin me alive if she finds I'm out here.
Yeah, thanks. We appreciate that.
It's great to hear from you.
Your father had the finest sense of justice of any man I ever met--
Could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you -- me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.
Holy shit, I've been going out with a loaded gun!
I'm incarcerated, Lloyd! I don't deserve to lose my daughter over this. I don't deserve to have you as my go-between. And I can't for the life of me figure out how she could choose to champion in mediocrity the way she flirts around you.
See ya, fellas.
What do you think?
We're gonna be here a week?
Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
Why would I mind?
Uh, huh. I have been thinking. It is too dangerous if we let him go. It may be too dangerous if we let him stay.
Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there?
Yes... yes, I do.
I'm so glad you're safe. You look really wonderful.
Start with what you knew then.
Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now? They're two different things?
Um -- not right now.
I don't know, M'sieu Giron!
Under the table!
My gift to you.
What the hell is that?
Oh, look at me, darling. I thought this gentleman was a waiter.
C'mon. I insist.
I told you I need a drink.
Pour me a full glass. I'll pay for it.
It's time you started working on your interviews.
I'm not really hungry.
Wrong. It's because you ain't got the baby batter in your brain any more. That'll fuck with your head, that stuff will.
Thanks, honey.
Remember that day?
Hey, I'm starved... Let's go get something to eat. We'll bring back food for everybody.
This "Denial of Death". You remember this?
You've talked enough today, you're hoarse now.
What's she like? What's she like?...
Is there a woman?...Tell me the truth... There is a woman.
Nothing, there's nothing. It's all out of focus.
They're not my words. John Wayne said it in Shepherd of the Hills.
What you say is wonderful! But sad...
Eh! Love...what a mystery! I understand you, Toto...The ones with blue eyes are the most beautiful. Whatever you do, you can't make friends with them. Eh, there's nothing to be done about it! The heavier a man is, the deeper his footprints. And if he's in love, he suffers, because he knows he's up a one-way street. Because love is a meaningless thing when a man gets it into his head to do what he wants...
Hi, Elena!
The best table in the house.
Eve?!
Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you.
How 'bout this one?
What about her?
Why?! I think she's very attractive.
Yes.
She's gone to the theatre -- don't you know?
I've looked at it.
Tell them my house exploded.
Okay, call them. Fine. Oh-- And if you could find out why they double- booked the job, and who is trying to kill me, and call me back-- that's be great.
You mean to tell me that you invited this Mr. Fitzsimmons over to talk about investing his money in your cockamamie idea?
Well, okay. What's the big deal? If she'll forget the new fireplace, I'll marry her. Just point me in the right direction.
That's all well and good, but we don't have the money to manufacture them.
No, I'm not, but --
What do you mean?
I understand perfectly, Mr. Pinkus, and as long as I am Mayor --
I was only doing my duty. Nothing personal in it.
Save that for the Tribune.
What did you say your name was -- Pinkus?
A very fine-looking women.
Oh.
I'm not married.
Still, someone must attend you. Your wife should not have let you out.
It's nothing.
I don't know.
That Bausch Lomb Saline shit you asked for is gonna be eighty bucks.
Come on.
What?
Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?.
Come on, we're next.
What?
Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
I've had enough...for now.
Great.
No, thanks. Love a little bundt cake if you have some!
Really? But, Maxine, can of worms! End of the world! Illusory nature of existence!
We don't need a new jail.
Danny's gonna be out for blood the next time.
Rather have that than the ten-foot- high catfish statue--
We're already renting cells to the Feds for their overflow--
Mary Hatch, why in the world did you ever marry a guy like me?
All right, sir.
When I go off?
Because I just think you two would hit it off real well together.
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sure.
What?
You admit you're lying?
No, no...
No, they're having a meeting, Melanie. Your sparrow is standing on a soap box and...
I hadn't thought of that. And then the swifts came.
Melanie, Melanie...
Oh!
Everything happens for a reason. That's what my dad said.
The payoff.
I'm sixteen years old. I'm underage. How could I possibly threaten you?
It there's one thing I don't need advice on, it's how to drive.
They could put you in jail.
I'm serious, Dave -- you could get in a lot of trouble for something like this.
I've got to go.
Please stay.
Go?
Jennyhaydn.
Goodbye.
That so.
Who is Mickey?
Oh. Mixed up in that revolution?
Well, you can't win 'em all.
No.
What is it?
Great.
I will.
Oh, well, I-if it's inconvenient, eh, we can't do it now... that's fine, too. W-w-w-we'll do it another time.
David.
You're not having a good time are you?
Good.
Jack.
Are you cold?
Yes.
I'm not going to college, Jos. And I'm not playing anymore baseball. This is my life.
No, it is. It's just one more thing to add to your "things that make you a better person than me" list.
See!
She just needs a new windshield wiper.
No, I know, but I pulled some strings, got him to look at your writing, and he agreed to meet you.
Our penguin, right?
He's going in!
Please, God. Let this be it.
Oh my God! I almost forgot--I got you a meeting with the admissions guy from Dartmouth!
Yeah, actually I do.
Come on, Jim. Where are you?
And what favour does Mr. Tilney receive from you?
I have lost my gift.
Fine.
I don't want to be friends anymore.
We still having dinner in L.A.?
Beautiful.
Sorry.
YOU THINK GOD ISN'T BIG ENOUGH TO DELIVER HIS OWN MESSAGES?
I mean, it's not true, is it?
I just told you.
Who indeed...
That's no reason. Everybody wants to fly. My grandmother wants to fly. You going after a job with one of the airlines?
I want to fly jets, sir!
Why? Because you can do it alone?
No, sir!
What is it, the kicks? Is that it?
I don't want to do something anybody can do.
Pity you don't have the character.
That's not true, sir! I've changed a lot since I've been here! And I'm gonna make it, sir!
Not a fucking chance, asshole!
I'm getting one heck of a glare off your dress there. Could you undo a few buttons?
Where'd she go?
She probably had sex scheduled for 12:30. O'Neill, let's pick up the guys for a drink... I have major news to announce.
No, no you're right, I'm sorry. He uses women; he lets them kill themselves. Is that how you want it?
A puppet.
You're not Gibarian...
We just did.
You made a mistake, Paul. You shouldn't have taken Elton out.
It's not just cactus. There's the nopals, the yuccas--
How bad did Mac get you? We figured pretty bad.
Cliff--
Oh, you're speaking of my charming wife Mrs. Alabama Worley.
Oh, ahh, oil change, I...ehh...I just drove in from Chicago and uhh...nice hair.
Sit over there, will you?
Me sir?
How are you? How're you feeling?
'Feeling'? I feel fine. How do you feel?
Good morning.
Good morning, Bill.
Stuff, sir?
That goo. That stuff that tastes like soap.
Um -- well, I didn't sleep too well. This is crazy. This is the left- field thing of all time. What do I do? What do I tell my family?
Yes, sir.
Oh, yes, sir. Here it is, sir. The pate de fois gras, sir.
Yeah, that's fine. Have a lot of it because she likes it.
You think I don't hear things?
How'd you know?
Hey, screw ya brain on right. Now, who's this girl you're going out with tonight?
Ya sure?
No, two yards from Snyder, an' a grand from Cappoli.
You don't look like a college girl.
Yeah? What do you do now?
I believe we share an art instructor
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?
Sure, you are.
Looks like things worked out tonight, huh?
I told them you wouldn't want an attorney present.
I told them you wouldn't want to hide.
We need ammo... Go check his jacket, I'll cover you.
You gotta go, we're pinned down!
Okay?
My band.
He'll come around.
I want juice!
I won't.
You're wrong. Look at his face.
Which we all know are the forces that tend to pull objects part, right, professor?
About dinner as a concept or about dinner with... Raoul?
Well -- I guess so.
Fine. And I want you to know I'll work very hard to justify your confidence in me -- SHELDRAKE Sure you will. Say, Baxter, about the apartment - now that you got a raise, don't you think we can afford a second key?
Oh, yes. Very attractive. Is she -- the lucky one?
You know my secretary -- Miss Olsen --
Yes, sir. You can't be too careful.
No, you don't understand. She's a busybody -- always poking her nose into things -- and with that key passing back and forth -- why take chances?
To me?
Oh, yes. Thanks.
I mean -- the young lady -- whoever she may be -- it was on the couch when I got home last night.
I can go to the bar.
I'll give you another chance to tell the truth, Lother.
Well -- come on.
I know why you're not taken -- no one can catch up with you.
Relax -- you're gaining.
How do you think I got here?
Aren't you allowed to kiss back?
No. The doctor said it would be bad for my -- thermostat.
When you come on, you really come on.
AHHHHHHH!
You think we need a new jail?
The doctor? Was the doctor here?
What is it, a sore throat or what?
I appreciate you telling me.
Don't know if I'll still want it.
I don't understand what's going on.
Yeah, the short, gray hairs.
What are you talking about?
I'm sure there are worse people to talk to, but I don't know who they are.
Who have you been talking to?
Friend. Baseball bat.
Well, you've got him by the short- hairs.
He said that?
Jeez, Mary... I'm...
Gesundheit. This requires a little thought here.
Do you mind if I talk to you, Mary? You don't have to pay any attention to me.
They're way downtown. They'd be on my side, too.
In a day or so, I think.
-- that was lust --
-- the passion in your heart --
For fuck's sake, Abbe! What am I to do? Police my readers as you police me? Suppose one of your precious wards had attempted to walk on water and drowned? Would you condemn the Bible? I think not!
An innocent child is dead.
Oh, I'm to be blamed now, am I?
Your words drove Bouchon to --
Oh, that's rich -- coming from her lapdog --
I saw the longing in your eye --
So many authors are denied the gratification of a concrete response to their work. I am blessed, am I not?
That is, if you'll come to my room for an hour, I will give you five hundred dollars.
That's funny. I wonder if you'll take two hundred and fifty dollars to fuck me?
Not really. My room's not far. The Whole Year Inn. You can drive with me if you want...
I don't know. Everything seems like nothing now against that I want you in my bed. I don't care if I burn in hell. I don't care if you burn in hell. The Past and Future is a joke to me now. I see that they're nothing, I see they ain't here. The only thing that's here is you. And me. I want you to come upstairs. Now. I tried to take everything last night, like you told me, but I couldn't. I couldn't take everything in a hundred years. It's the way we are. We compound each other.
Why?
Isn't that great?
...you know? I, uh...
You disappointed?
What a relief!
There's something I should tell you, Judy.
Here we are-- out of cigarettes-- Junior's in the nurs'ry-- See how late it gets--
Can I help you?
No.
Well what's the point in that?
Hey. Didn't you steal that one already?
What?
I'll say a lot of things I've never said before. It's habit.
That was the truth.
What did I say?
Going on?
I can't pick you up.
Say when.
I beg to differ. We started a Fight we never got to finish. Play for blood, remember?
He'll do no such thing.
Madeleine's not wicked. It's the Marquis who's corrupted her. That's not her fault; it's mine.
It's a weak man who tests his mettle on the backs of children --
This child let loose the beast from its cage --
Yes, yes, right.
So you believed the bartender. Why?
You risk your life when you cross the street.
Our clothes are dry.
Checking out the competition.
Yes, sir. It's true.
That's what everybody believes?
It's Ukrainian. Her grandparents immigrated here.
This is great son, just great. By the way, Eve's last name. Rus-to-kov, that's not Russian, is it?
Positive. The Soviet Union collapsed without a shot being fired. The Cold War is over.
You're sure?
Dad, I don't know how to tell you this. And I was going to wait a while, but I think...Dad,there was no bomb. A plane crashed into our backyard. I looked it up in old newspapers.
Uh-huh.
As I suspected, you're a rank sentimentalist.
I told you, "I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?
Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
Someday, you may not mind so much.
Yeah, I'm crimes against persons and property now, also sex crimes and child abuse.
Now you are confusing me, Mrs De Moraes.
It's not.
Thirty-seven girls. And not one who can carry a tune. That must be statistically impossible.
Thirty-seven. Thirty-seven.
Yes, it is.
I ran back in to get the phone.
What's so special about it?
Nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. Look, you don't need a LeSabre to go out with Sue Ann. Take the blue Corsica. I'll see you when I get home.
I ain't so sure it's a great idea, but that's up to you. Just don't tell her where we are.
Honey, we bein' strangers here and all, this is the kinda place we don't want to make nothin' of nothin'.
Yeah.
More'n likely.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Somethin' botherin' you?
Maybe you inspire me.
There is one other matter.
Scobie?
Why did she never tell her daughter?
When did you build this?
Well, yes -- usually -- I'd just changed to go home -- but I thought I'd just deal with this final call.
Wherever you'd like...
I'll see what I can do.
Yes, the police must be called.
-- We must do something...
Oh, no -- no -- not the Baron.
No -- no -- wait -- the man was a burglar -- he was going to steal my money.
Oh -- the Baron -- the Baron.
My best friend -- poor, Baron -- dead -- just like that.
He tried to rob me -- he is dead --
Her room -- oh -- I see, Mr. Preysing -- I understand, Mr. General Director Preysing.
Where is that girl -- she was working with him -- she enticed me into her room.
What exactly do you think your job is, Private?
You don't sound too enthusiastic.
And that's the job? Nothing about serving your country?
Who's "they"?
Well?
It's incredible who's here.
Me!
Yeah.
'Joe...'
You bet. I'm king of my Rotisserie League.
This is exciting--but if it's been stolen they can't get away with it on a ship--
How'd it go, son?
She misses me.
I wouldn't be surprised--
What I did with those companies was perfectly legal.
I say none of us leave this room until our young Mary here stops jerking us around and decides once and for all who she wants. Now Mary, I know this is difficult but you really will be doing them all a favor to tell them the truth about us.
If you're so happy with them, please, be my guest.
My god, all this time...I never stopped loving you...
We haven't anything to discuss with you. We'll talk to a lawyer!
I m out of the doghouse?
I ll just full yours up to the top. Happy anniversary, sweetheart.
She died of secrecy , she died of ignorance ...
What'd she die of?
How about this child? You expect her to be responsible?
How about expecting people to be responsible enough to control themselves to begin with?
It's just a marvel to me that you still have such high expectations of people.
At least now I know what the hell they're saying.
So, does my hair look better -- like this, or... like this?
This was remade? Into what?
Bli-hinded by the light -- cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night, blinded...
How the hell do you know all these random songs?
It's early Springsteen, dude, this is classic. This was before the cheesy remake.
Who are you? Hitler's hall monitor?
And little hurly-burly came by in her curly-wurly, and asked me if I needed I ri-hide --
Dude, I wish you wouldn't do that.
You got something up your sleeve for tonight, Finch?
I don't know. Always wanted to be a criminal, I guess. Just not this big a one... Takes all kinds though.
It's all in the tongue. Another bottle?
What does she say?
You're always picking on me. It took me three hours to get those little gadgets in those holes, and you screw it up in a minute. Hey, look!
Aagh! No wonder you're batty. Would it be imposing too much upon you if I asked you to do a little work today? Just to sort of break the monotony?
With me you can always do business.
Do you know what to do in a drawing- room?
It isn't a question of knowing what to do, it's knowing how to get in one that counts.
Now listen, we've got a tip that the Schuyler family has finally made a deal with that chorus dame.
Gloria Golden?
Yeah, little Gloria.
Stop, will you?!
Claire...!
Claire, will you calm down?
We kissed. Made out a little. Then you passed out.
They tell me it has a wonderful restaurant on the second floor.
That's right.
While you eat, you look at the view.
Why don't you get rid of him and Get yourself straight dealer?
He was...my responsibility--my RIO.
Goose is dead.
I know. I was there.
I'm fine.
My first squadron in Vietnam, we lost eight out of eighteen planes. Ten guys. The first one kills you, but there'll be others--you can count on it.
No.
Listen: I don't care about anything but the fact that you are here. You are her, you are Rheya.
What?
How so?
In that case --
No.
It would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold.
I know this ain't easy, Lula, but I ain't gonna let things get no worse, I promise.
Hey, pretty woman... Sailor here?
I sold it this morning. I'm going to take cabs from now on in.
Man, I gotta take a piss bad... Can I use your head there?
A comedy! What will my hero be but the saddest wretch in the kingdom, sick with love?
I don't mean your head head - I'm not gonna piss on your head - your hair an' all... Just piss in the toilet. Y'all take a listen - here a deep sound comin' down from Bobby Peru.
Well?...
Is there a contract?... We made a deal once that we'd tip each other off if we ever heard.
You know, I really do like a woman with tits like yours that talks tough and acts like she can fuck like a bunny... Can you fuck like that?... You like it like a bunny?... Huh?... Cause baby, I'll fuck you like a real good like a big ol' jack-rabbit bunny... Jump all around in that hole... Bobby Peru doesn't come up for air.
Hey... You gotta smell in this room of puke... You been pukin' in here, little girl? Huh?... You sick?... Pregnant?
Thanks...
You didn't?
Am I scarin' ya?... Your pussy wet?... Come on... is it?... Hey, don't jump back so slow... I thought you was a bunny... Bunny jump fast - you jump back slow... Mean somethin', don't it?... Means somethin' to me... Means you want Bobby Peru... You want Bobby Peru to fuck you hard baby - open you up like a Christmas present.
But what brought you to Sicily?
It's the Free Diving World Championship. I am by the way world champion!
No, no. You'll like it. It's superb.
Just remember, Lamar, I could have gone up and back and nobody would have been the wiser--
A spaghetti del mare for the super dedicated traveling insurance agent.
What for?
It's me.
You do, huh.
I don't have your number.
I got the better end of the deal. I just lent you my body--you lent me your dream.
They're nothing. They're nobody. I want the Cowboys. All of 'em. I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory.
Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served. That means we got the Cowboys without quarter. The Black flag, brother. No Prisoners, no mercy, amen.
I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those.
To kill. The taste of blood in your mouth.
The moment of truth.
You think so, sir?
Sure. Be able to tell your children. Something for them to look up to. Be proud of.
Well, you'll soon have stories like that to tell of your own.
For fuck's sake, woman! BONBONS? I'm to sit here, gorging myself on useless trifles, sucking down your little sweetmeats, when what I truly need -- what I truly require -- are a few quill pens? Perhaps a pot of ink?
She's obviously that. Jesus! Which would you rather have, a million dollars or one of Sissy's thumbs full of pennies?
Ninety degrees to the left, I hope. How does she feel about you?
She always leaves town, you dummy. That doesn't mean anything. What about in bed? How does she like it in bed?
Thus..... with a kiss...... I die.
I'll watch the alleyway -- in case it goes that way.
Why only fifty percent, Ruth? Why not ask for a hundred percent?
He is a difficult customer, that Rick. One never knows what he'll do or why. But it is worth a chance.
Rick?
Not for sure, Monsieur, but I will venture to guess that Ugarte left those letters with Monsieur Rick.
Do you know where they are?
Those letters were not found on Ugarte when they arrested him.
Yes, something.
I observe that you in one respect are a very fortunate man, Monsieur. I am moved to make one more suggestion, why, I do not know, because it cannot possibly profit me, but, have you heard about Signor Ugarte and the letters of transit?
Stay here. That was my son!
Well, good luck. But be careful. You know you're being shadowed?
We've decided, Signor Ferrari. For the present we'll go on looking for two exit visas. Thank you very much.
You sure?
I was just going to kind of move around.
Shutup! I want nothin' -- I ain't no charity case! Get outta my house!
You ain't no friend no more -- Go home! Outta my house I want ya!
Yo -- I ain't mad. I'm just outta joint when reporters are around -- They take cheap shots an' Paulie knows it.
...What's to say? I dunno what he wants from me --
Nothin'! I want nothin' from you!!!
Yeah, I have to judge who can drive home and who can't. I have to keep their keys.
Hold it -- Italy just finished. They're recognizing Great Britain.
Losing his teeth.
Yeah. Jesus, you look like fucking royalty, Tommy.
Another five years, huh?
It ain't always a blessing. My brother here?
How we doing?
Great. Terrific. Glad you could make it.
Yeah... But he didn t beat the demons... A quarter of all the shoes sold in Europe are made by or retailed through his parent s leather empire. All started from a small shop in the East End of London and war reparation money for holocaust victims.
His mother would be pleased to hear that.
That s what he said. I tried to dissuade him... Told him I couldn t take on another child, that he d get into trouble... I mean, people who sell children... But he wasn t listening... I guess he finally found himself a crusade... His family think he s back on drugs, eh? Huh... Leon did drugs. A lot of drugs. Went through his self-destruct phase, you know? Things to come to terms with. Demons to fight... Some people s minds are gloriously uncomplicated. Not Leon s. He did beat the drug, though. He did.
Good reasons?
Get up there and we'll get it back down here for me. Now.
It's up. Love gives you wings. You can fly away from here.
Our life in a nutshell...
Something happened to them, mon.
Ho - ly - shit.
Don't depend on it. Will you? That little bit of air, each day there's less of it, which is al right, which is quite all right.
The mines, the wires, there's a trick. Some explode if you stretch the wires, some if you cut them.
With pleasure. Won't you sit down?
Then I know my alphabet.
There's a mine here, but the others are far enough away, I think at least to give me a chance. I have to work out which one to cut before I fall over.
Sorry about that.
I am afraid not. My regrets, Monsieur.
Well, perhaps I shall like it in Casablanca.
All anybody saw was Clint Eastwood drinkin' coffee.
Johnny...
You have the right to remain silent. But anything you say may be taken down in evidence and used against you--
It's only ninety seconds up the line. You're on a connection to a trans Siberian express.
Both sides of the street, I'm afraid.
And how is Mrs. Reiser?
That would be Thibadeaux. The cop I work for every now and then. Catching thieves. The really good ones--the ones who imitate me.
I'm sure this beautiful room must appeal to your taste -- distinctive, don't you think? Velvet upholstery -- 'A-number one'. I'm in the textile trade and I know. And these are real silk drapes.
After you, Doll.
Bar across the street.
I laugh sometimes
Am I happy? I don't know. Happy As the next man, I guess. I don't Laugh all day long like an idiot, If that's what you mean.
Oh, thank you, George, old boy, old boy. Now, look if you'll point me in the right direction . . . would you do that? George?
Right down here.
We sure do. I don't mean it as a knock either. Go ahead. I'll just say what I think and you can disregard it if you want.
This is uncomfortable for me -- because, well, I don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.
Thanks.
I understand. I'll go with you.
Okay. I think I'd better be alone for a while.
It's been a while since you read the news -- I'll have somebody work with you. Just on superficial performance things.
Prepare what? You have Saturday's news handy?
Please prepare carefully. This couldn't come at a better time.
Wait.
It just might not work for me because of our different approaches.
But they're so down to earth, such wonderful people...
I mean she's a junior at Chicago University, she's twenty years old! Like when I first met you.
And she's all wrong for me!
You don't understand. I've never felt this way about anybody!
It's her home! It's where she lives!!
Look, you're not gonna take Shelly's camper.
Thank you, Uncle.
Don't be a fool. You lost your bag. The company'll make good. What's your name?
Wait!
Depends on the varietal. Just get a sense of it. Thick? Thin? Watery? Syrupy? Inky? Amber, whatever...
Willful creature, that one...
Okay. I'll take two guys off.
You can wire home for some money when we get to Jacksonville.
Right.
What do you know about Conrad?
Did who?
Right.
Basically broke down how I'm gonna make mad loot in the NBA, me being such a limited commodity and all.
-- look, he bested you with strength, your greatness. He bested me with steel. He must have outthought Vizzini, and a man who can do that can plan my castle's onslaught any day. Let's go --
Aren't you hot in that?
No.
Oh, so you did give her ten thousand dollars, eh? and there are letters...
But I got him! He's in jail! Wasn't that the point...?!
It wasn't a bad bust. He gave himself up because he knew I was gonna nab him.
Even Joey Venza?!
Macaulay.
He must have been great-looking, right?
Wholesome.
Oh, God! Do you hear a buzzing? Is there a buzzing?
Do I have a private office somewhere in the building?
That s the kind of thing you can really build on...
If there's nothing wrong with me then why does he want me to come back for tests?!
She's just not the girl for me.
Stella!
It's very simple. She belongs in that rarefied atmosphere of Park Avenue, expensive restaurants, and literary cocktail parties.
Too perfect. Too beautiful, too talented, too sophisticated, too everything -- but what I want.
Huh. Maybe a little strawberry. Yeah, strawberry. I'm not so sure about the cheese.
Can you see her tramping around the world with a camera bum who never has more than a week's salary in the bank? If only she was ordinary.
Melvin...
Do you ever get an erection for a woman?
I am afraid of nothing.
-- what? --
Dancing?
I didn't want to see you. I mean, I did...but I didn't..
How could you?
I'm sorry you saw one of our notification cards. You never should have.
They're jammed!
Ah, your journal. This will be invaluable.
December 15th, 2004. I met someone tonight. Oh, Christ: I don't know what to do. Her name is Clementine and she's amazing. So alive and spontaneous and passionate and sensitive. Things with Naomi and I have been stagnant for so long.
Hit the brakes!
Can a pig whistle?
Could we go with you and film it?
Liquid gold.
How do I look, mama?
I never lied. I may have miscalculated -- that happens sometimes, but --
Let's keep it that way.
Jesus Christ, what the hell are you doing here? What's going on? Who's upstairs?
How are you, Richard?
Maurice? From Lompoc? Good God.
That's 'cause we're damn near an hour ahead of schedule.
Well... I'll tell you. One day about a month ago...
I'm sorry about that. Really. But --
Okay, we got a straight shot to T Town, so let her roll.
You did? Wow, sorry about that. Listen, Mario's a little not so bright. He seems to think that you said --
You know, to be 'normal' and live in the 'real world,' to swallow Coca cola and eat Kentucky Fried Chicken, you have to be in a conspiracy against yourself. I can't lie to me, Liza. And the more I strip through the sham, the crazier I look to people like you. Can't you see that's what they're counting on? You want to go out sometime?
I better get going.
... So, after all these years, you must have lots of questions to ask. Am I right?
Do you have a fella?
Holy Toledo! That's six years ahead of schedule!
Why that pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline. Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
I pray thee, chde me not; whom I love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow; the other did not so.
No, San Francisco. What are you...?
Plato.
Ok. Thank you.
No, sir. I just went next door to look at them like I always do. They were nursing on their mother and I did it. I guess I'm just no good?
Criminal.
... Now he's going to want to stay. And they'll want to take a ride to the lake or whatever. So it's a good five hours back. It gives us a chance to take it easy and...
Why?
A challenge, on my life.
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
And you hoped to spend the rest of your life with him?
Rephrase. Mrs. Rexroth, have you ever been in love?
And you've always loved him?
Lysergic acid diethylamide... With a little kicker of my own. Surely it must be coming back to you by now?
What's that?
Could you be a little more specific?
Who have you been talking to, Jerry? Who else knows what you know?
Looks like we got a Mexican standoff.
Yeah.
Did Confucius say that?
I'm sure picking up on vices.
I like Glaucus.
That's what Serafine is searching for. Without much luck, I'm afraid. If only we could speak with him. But alas, he's off in another realm, close to death.
Eight o'clock. Shit. You'd think my uncle would have left a clue, a note, something...
Listen, either he wastes away as a pathetic vegetable or he can give what's left of his life to save hundreds of potential victims. He's a McDermott. I know what his choice would be.
I told you. He already tried to contact me once. If you saw his face... He was desperate to tell me something. I owe him this.
So he bought this Peugeot sedan at a greatly reduced price while he was there in charge of the White House Advance Team.
Not impressed exactly -- but a break in the clouds.
Thanks a lot, Buddy.
Ah, I don't want any credit. Bobbie and I serve anonymously.
Well, Mickey and Mallory can't be together. So, we'll put you on one of our prison busses and you'll take Mallory first, then you'll come back for Mickey.
Wayne Gayle.
Karen, I told you not to--
Basic. Hmmm.
Twisted?
My mother said he never asked about--
You really think she's been sent... by God?
...but he found you.
. . . Tubby?
Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly I remember the last one. A wow finish. A guy standing on a station platform in the rain with a comical look on his face, because his insides had been kicked out.
I came to see you.
Oh, great...
Okay.
Hey, great idea. What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.
Fantastic. The Girlfriend Lottery.
But it wasn't supposed to be like this. When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...
I figured it had to be something ridiculous to win your respect. And piss you off.
I guess I never told you I'm afraid of heights.
Try lookin' at it from this angle
Forget it. I'm stayin'.
Maybe.
So we don't know for sure about you, either.
I have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. Don't you?
Yeah...
But sick -- nauseous -- where everything looks distorted and everything inside just aches -- when you can barely get up the will to complain.
Well that's what I'm trying to figure out. How long have you known him?
You don't think they're too big?
That's love.
I'd say you turned out just fine.
Wait...woah...woah...wait a minute...Do you think I'm your father?
It's good to see Maggie again...and you.
Well I didn't know about you until after she was gone.
I'll beat you both apart. I'll take you both together.
You've been mostly dead all day.
Buttercup is marrying Humperdinck in a little less than half an hour, so all we have to do is get in, break up the wedding, steal the Princess, make our escape after I kill Count Rugen.
Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
What if I told you he did this to me?
Who are his ghosts?
Ow! Whatever it is, it hurts.
Nor can I. Damn! It's buzzing all around me. Ouch! I can hear it like a fly trapped inside my ear... Says its name is Oona!
I brought you Chinese soup.
Yeah.
You can stop. I will go on alone.
You promised.
I can't stay on this planet.
You promised you would get me to my ship.
Your daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. Mind your step.
I'm your son.
It should be back from your face -- with a bun at the neck. I told them. I told you.
Because I can hear it.
What matters to me is we've got the six easiest nights we've had in ten years. So 'Tie a Yellow Ribbon' sounds a little flat. So what? Nobody's gonna hear it, Jack. Nobody. So why should you care?
Doesn't it matter to you?
What?
He said he'll pick it up in a couple of days.
I'm not Bill Mitchell.
I couldn't plead insanity, because you see I'm just as sane as anybody else.
Why aren't you at work?
Is something wrong?
Those were police laboratory people, they've been over the apartment.
Where'd you spend last night?
I called Trina.
Bree, what's actually happened? It wasn't that bad.
Tell him to look through it.
Yeah, my room-mate leaves it on the TV.
I don't know.
But, you got four children!
Well, I-I don't think it's a very good idea.
Because it's the last thing in the world we need right now.
Well...I-I think we should wait till things settle.
Will Bogey get bent?
Are you kidding? He'll piss himself with joy. He's the ultimate kiss ass.
It's more
Exactly So, you going to Bogey Lowenbrau's thing on Saturday?
True, you're a lot handsomer now. Don't you have enough blood already?
We're gonna have to do a little tightrope act.
I understand, Deb. 'Bye... be happy.
You're soundin' real bodacious. Back.
You always were sneaky, Stan, very sneaky.
You what?
Stella -- how long do you think he'll stay there?
That'll get her out of there, won't it?
Smart girl.
Believe me, I wouldn't be doing this unless it was absolutely necessary. I have an idea for something.
I'm going to have to do a story from beginning to end on my own.
Had a letter from my wife. The wisteria is still out, which I'm looking forward to. She says Dorset is gripped with Invasion Fever. Wrong coast I should have thought, still
I don't know what else to tell you. I wasn't hiding out. I hit my head and I didn't remember anything until a few days ago.
No. We're going to lock this up and --
I told you so.
You'll like it fine.
Very nice. What is it?
That's going to be fun.
I doubt it not. Trust me, love, all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our times to come. Adieu.
No. And nobody knows where she is.
Did you ever see her again?
Toto, sooner or later there comes a time when talking or keeping quiet is the same thing. So it's better to shut up. It's hot in here. Toto, take me to the beach.
They tell me you never go out, never talk to anybody. Why?
You 're thinner...You can tell you've not been treated well. .
You daft prick!
Steve and me, we use a saddle for a pillow and roll up in a tarp.
Mostly, we open a can of beans and boil some coffee.
It seemed like a possibility. What about your intentions? Are they honorable?
In the grub box. Toward morning the dew gets kind of heavy so maybe you better fix up a bed under the wagon. Spread some bunch grass under the tarp and the ground won't be so hard.
You love Allison, don't you?
'Love'? Oh, man, I've got troubles of my own.
Love.
Confused, huh? About what?
C'mon, have a drink. You look like you need one bad as me.
How did you meet?
Oh yes, I do.
I'm not a violent man, Mr. Lowry. Not by nature, anyhow. But if you hurt Liza in any way, I'll kill you. Does that seem honorable?
Tony -- what do you think?
I was called and I came. What's up?
Great. Excellent. Thanks.
Absolutely. Never trust a vegetarian.
I'm not sure what you mean.
Quit. He's too good.
And them fingers, them chubby fingers. And that stroke. It's like he's, uh, like he's playing a violin or something.
Nine ball. Three ball.
You should think of me as Liza Sutton's guardian angel.
Didn't I see you fight in the Garden one night three or four years ago? With a fellow called Wilson?
Well, it'll be worth it if we can tell the waterfront story the way the people have a right to hear it. Don't you think?
I guess it's pretty tough work at that.
I think you could have.
You want to know something I would have taken Wilson
Wilson yeah yeah I fought Wilson.
You sure looked it. Something go wrong?
If I licked him I would have had the title shot instead of him boy, I was ready that night.
Please, get out of my mind!
Only God knows the answer to that.
9:30's almost 10:30. Where I come from, the sun's over the yardarm, m'boy, and the cocktail lamp is lit.
What do you do that for?
And that?
Time I was convicted in California? FBI told me I'd robbed more banks than anyone in the computer.
But how can I win? Adrian is stronger and smarter than me.
A speech impediment?
What is it?
Leave me alone -- !
I don't know anything.
Stop it!
I didn't know either.
They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness.
From Princess Helena and other members of your family.
I have a letter, ma'am.
She doesn't talk?
Smythe, come here. I want to talk to you. Come on, Smythe, talk to me. Smythe, I'm going nuts. I'm going nuts in this house! This big . . . come on, I'm not going to hurt you. Come on, what's the matter with you?
Not to anybody. She sings.
Hey, Josie, hold on. You've been hiding something from me.
He died a long time ago.
Not much to tell. I went to public school. Went to university on scholarship. Went to work for an investment firm. In eight years I owned it. My father was chairman of the board of the third company I ever went after. I swallowed that company and shit out the pieces. One of the pieces was him.
Easier than learning how to be poor. My father's family was wealthy. When I was young there were cars and houses, private schools, nannies. But then my father divorced my mother to marry another woman. And he took his money with him.
No.
Shhh! Do you hear something?
What for?
I am trying to tell you I have no personal feelings about you, Mr. Robinson. I am trying to tell you I do not resent you.
You don't respect me terribly much either, do you?
No, I don't.
Well, I don't think we have a whole lot to say to each other, Ben. I do think you should know the consequences of what you've done. I do think you should know that my wife and I are getting a divorce soon.
Now look -- please --
I am not threatening you.
Do you want to unclench your fists, please? Thank you. I can see in the dark, you know. I've been here quite a while.
If that's my fate, so be it. I'm not leaving. I love her, Jack.
But why?
Why?
Did you?
When you re ready to let go, to be unsingle and unmiserable, you will. Until then....
Yes.
First of all, it s never out of the blue. And second of all--
Admit it. You were disturbed, but ultimately moved.
I have a different story for every woman who asks. I look at her and figure out what she needs to hear to feel okay about being with me.
You look a little shaken.
Last night? What do you mean?
I went for four.
You're coming back--
That depends on how mother's feeling. You'll excuse me, gentlemen?
A good day for singing...
I've not heard a note out of you.
Sorry to interrupt you, Mr Brett, but I have a message for you.
What is it?
Your mother is feeling seasick and would like to see you right away.
Oh, is she? What a shame! You'll pardon me?
Okay. I was just trying to make conversation.
Hurry up and get dressed.
If you didn't waste so much time on that wise-cracking drummer we'd have been through with breakfast by this time.
...Hello?
Let him have everything he wants. Now hustle and write me a story from the point of view of the escaped man. He hides, cowering... Afraid of every light, of every sound... hears footsteps... his heart going like that... And all the time they're closing in... Get the sense of an animal at bay!
Hi Ma...
It's just a joke. A stupid joke.
Hey, I can get you three hundred cash for two hours.
I wish my son knew what he wanted to do.
Thanks. To you too...
What?
Horses.
No.
Uh-huh.
Yes. You wouldn t know where I could reach him? We had to discuss an exhibition of his photographs at my Paris gallery, you see? I really need to see him before I leave.
Now Ed, are we cross?
Why Ed, what an ugly thing to Say! Does this mean you're not my Friend anymore? You know, Ed, if I thought you weren't my friend I Don't think I could bear it.
Isn't that a daisy?
Everybody that she plays with dies.
Rose, listen--don't do anything. You know, I mean to yourself. Please listen...
Keep it.
That was kind of a rotten thing to do, Anne. After all, Gallagher is my friend. The least you can do is be courteous to her.
What I mean is, if you don't want to... keep the baby, I know a place where you can go.
Oh hello, Anne He types furiously.
Sorry, the Blue Thunder's out of commission for a while.
Ha!
Don' need you okayin'.
I am.
Yah.
Brung you flowers and all I gettin's facety back.
What?
Fiendishly so.
Give me some money.
The unhappy tale of a virginal laundry lass, the darling of the lower wards, where they entomb the criminally insane.
Shut up. Have you got your passport?
You've already stolen my heart, as well as another more prominent organ, south of the Equator...
Great! But that's the way things go. You think you got a swell yarn then something comes along messes up the finish and there you are.
Yeah, where am I?
Where did you meet him?
Miss Sellers, do you know Dr. Alan Paley?
After dinner I'll show you my puppets.
What was the nature of your relationship with Dr. Paley.
Hello, Joe. Sorry. Just a little gag of mine. Thought I'd have some fun with you.
The only one.
Maybe. Met a guy named Red, owns a garage, could have some work in about a week. Met a few hard luck boys who's stayin' here. What's that smell?
Yeah... I guess this is it, huh?
Hmmm . . .
Shut up. "Let's Get It On," Marvin Gaye, from Let's Get It On. "Airbag," Radiohead, from OK Computer.
Ooh! A kind of recent record! Rob's sly declaration of new classic-status slipped into a list of old classics! Nice! "Let's Get It On?" Couldn't you make it more obvious than that?
"Thunder Road," Bruce Springsteen, from Born to Run. "Smells Like Teen Spirit," Nirvana, Nevermind.
Oh no, Rob, that's not obvious enough. Not at all. Dick, did you hear that?
Okay. Top five side one track ones. Number one... "Janie Jones," the Clash, from The Clash.
Ehh.
I'll call you.
That way.
On their honeymoon.
Don't you never say that -- -- You guys talk like that in front of a little girl -- You guys are scum.
Aces full.
Well when you get older, you just have to.
That's right.
Beat it!
Sure.
Hell of a spot to put a business.
You sell much out here?
Because I could come...
I thought everything WAS arranged.
Cremated?!
Barman! Set'm up, fella!
I call this the staccato.
We're going to have to sit down, and talk about that sometime.
She took on so at your going away that she was obliged to console herself with a husband. She is now Mrs. John Best.
Mrs. John Best! Was there another Mr. John Best?!
There's only six Miss Dugans now... poor Dorothy.
Good heavens! Whatever? Has she died of grief?
Edie...
Edie, I need you to love me. Tell me you love me.
Edie, Edie, I...
I shagged Amy. Two years ago. That s why I ended it. And then, after you left, sod it, we kept at it like rabbits until we both realized it was absolutely mad. And, you know, morally wrong. Then there was that one other time. And that was it.
Y'know how I got started in the fight racket?
This guy is beautiful -- get the Cokes.
She is a dancer! And a lovely one! You would like her very much! Shall we dance?
No, I'm not! My mom taught me.
Nothing new. He's just going off duty.
Stay with this kid. He's a loser.
To love you until death. To subscribe to all your commands.
You can't see it, can you, Charlie? I mean, you've never been able to see it. I came after him. And I'm gonna get him. I'm goin' with him all the way. The pool game is not over until Minnesota Fats says it's over. Is it over, Fats?
Get with what?
Ah, get with it, will ya, Charlie?
You wanted ten thousand? You got ten thousand.
The pool game is over when Fats says it's over.
Eddie...
No, it isn't, Charlie.
She's not a...
So that's the kind of guy she likes? Pretty ones?
Sure have.
I'm workin' on it. But she doesn't seem to be goin' for him.
Now what?
I'm sure.
It's my first drink in three months. That okay with you, pop? She doesn't know me. I never saw her before Gus and I talked to her.
What you doin', son?
Sleepless and Son. Baltimore.
Like Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring. If that woman were still alive, she'd be wearing it.
Great.
Dying without ever reaching the top...
Mr. Hypnos, I saw a dream. My girlfriend was having it. She dreamed they were pulling the plug on me. She was watching me die.
Uh huh. And?
Mr. Hypnos - sir - I needed to talk to you -
Wait a minute. Stu Miley, right? Boys and girls ...Mr. Stu Miley, in the house! This is an honor. We see a lot of nightmares down here, but yours are like caviar, man. You da shits!!
How'd you get in there?
Stu... It's a party.
Tell me what?
Do you remember where you were?
A fact! Last night he killed a dog for pawing in his garden. Why? Because he had something buried in there. Something a dog could scent.
Now here's what's goin' down. Listen, 'cause I'm gonna say this but one time. On January first, the first day of the Bicentennial I'm gonna fight me a local poor underdog, dig? A snow-white underdog. An' I'm gonna put his face on this poster with me, hear? An' I'll tell you why, 'cause I'm sentimental -- An' all the people in the country all sentimental, man, an' they'd like nothin' better than me, Apollo Creed, to let some unknown get a shot at the greatest title in the world on this country's biggest birthday. Now that's the way I see it an' that's the way I want it!!
Nope. Can't. We're through.
Sandra Sinclair.
Sandra Sinclair. Wanna know her real name? Bella Iskowitz. No one's who they really are, Jer. Everyone's someone else. Even you. Even me. Especially me. I'm Peter Appleton, the communist who's not really a communist.
This is not a bender yet. This is the start of a bender. But I can see how you were confused, they look a lot alike.
Hey Peter, lemme ask you a question. An old girlfriend calls you out of the blue on Christmas Eve...
You let him pierce his nose?
They're none of them right.
So here is my candidate. What do you think?
Don't you understand? The board is going to replace me! That's what the "new blood" is for !
"An internship and two years of training at the Boston Lying-in, South End Branch. For his age, he was judged an accomplished gynecological obstetrical surgeon; he is also experienced in pediatric care..."
We all know who trained Homer--his credentials are as good as mine are. Don't you be holy to me about the law ! What has the law done for any of us here?
Well, we can only guess about that, Edna. They are against the law.
You think perhaps it was "old hambone?"
What's with the friggin numbers?
Take a guess... Let him guess!! Tch.
Uh... gee... well... you seem to be some kind of vigilante...
Uhh... I'm drawing a blank.
The Little...
No, no... I mean that sort of happens along the way but no... I'm on a very special quest.
A quest?
Good thing.
They work for Him.
Him...?
He's going to lose a lung. This is not good news for Athena--
It's not our job to get involved in your personal life, but when it interferes with the training here--
I'm an enemy?
He'll live.
He'll probably be getting a medical discharge--
Fifteen years, yeah.
God bless.
Oh, thank you.
So, did you do shoot the photographs in there or what?
I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur F lix lives?
Hell, why should the Datin' Game be different from real life? At least them boys is gonna get somethin' to eat.
Twenty-three months, eighteen days is all. Don't need to make more'n it was. This couple's goin' on a date to Hawaii. The girl chose him over the other two guys.
Gift certificates to Kentucky Fried Chicken.
We didn't have no TV up at Pee Dee, baby, you know?
Seems like everyone's getting married. A year ago it was all divorces. Now it's all weddings. Cyclical, I guess.
Back to the drawing board, I guess. Or not. So... you're married. Congratulations. You look happy.
Universally rejected. Strike three.
Since the last time we spoke? I don't know. Could be better. Could be worse.
Well, let's go have some champagne, shall we? Toast all the newlyweds.
I don't mention that Anna's a vegetarian, did I?
But I'm the only one she trusts.
"Poet?"
I was a poet till now, but I have seen beauty that puts my poems at one with the talking ravens at the Tower.
How do I offend, my lord?
Christopher Marlowe at your service.
She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does. You want to be careful.
... and maybe the king will give you some money, and a little land, and a title even... ... wouldn't that be a fine thing? You, a lady of title!
You don't know what you're saying. You're going to leave this place, Jeanne -- you're going home -- or whatever you want -- you're going to be happy, and have children, and...
I -- I don't understand...
Jeanne, you can't leave us like this!
The woman's surrounded by fools! She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning. Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight.
She's got an army of people to get her up and out.
Well, nice to see you now.
Me?
Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
Me? Forget it, son. I got millions.
What?!
Smile... good?
What?
Mi-chi-gan driver li-see-ens... Jennyhaydn... Money?
Minneapolis... Minneapolis...
'I hope your dreams come true.'
'Believe in yourself and they will. Let me ask you, Lizzie. Look in the mirror? Are you pretty --?'
Yeah, I saw her ... she was carried into the jungle by ... an animal.
An ape ... some kind of ape.
Whatta ya talkin' about it ain't my locker no more?
Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy -- honest I did.
Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
All right. That's your opinion. You're entitled to it, but --
Some people can. Now if you'll let me explain --
Lisa, simmer down -- will you?
Lisa! Shut up!
Did you ever eat fish heads and rice?
Well no, it's not noble, but it's a good aid to your lesson.
No.
I sell them.
By breaking up a company's assets --
Sera... what you don't understand is...
Do you have a girlfriend?
Oh...I'll think of something... What are you doing here?
Well what?
When we agree to do a job, we do it. Right?
Yeah, yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell, you know I love Ann and it's gonna be awfully hard for me to say it because, well, you know, she's so wonderful, and, well, the best I ever was was a bush-league pitcher.
I bet you he'd know how to say it all right. And me, I get up to it and around it and in back of it, but, but I never get right to it. Do you know what I mean? So the only chance I've got is, well, if somebody could kinda give her a warning sort of, sorta prepare her for the shock!
Oh, yeah. That's what I mean. See? It was easy as all that, huh?
Well, I was thinking that Yeah, you know, sort of break the ice.
Good night.
Trying to save your ass so you can save the world.
I'm goin'.
Where?
Ahh... my wife's.
What'd you get her?
Huh? Oh, umm, a car. So, to a successful transaction...
If you ate at the Tip Top you did.
Oh, yes, with the coffee...
Yep, Betty pours a pretty mean cup.
I like this. I like doing business in the home. It's cozy... Who's birthday?
You've raised it up to the chin, I see. Go on in the other room and get yourself a drink.
Miss Daniel? My name is Klute -- John Klute --
The kid on the windy side of the baker's window. That's how he put it.
That was great.
I'll get it if you want.
Come on in.
Oh, there must be one in Paris... They have everything in Paris.
Yes.
Your studies?
Yes.
Your classmates?
Yes.
You liked your teachers?
No.
I see. Were you happy at school, Harold?
No.
Is this a friend you had when you were away at school?
Yeah.
I came back 'cause you were here.
You know the other day, you asked why I came back?
Nothing.
Yeah.
No, I can t. We re late for a dance lesson. I guess you ll have to finish up later.
-- and I was wondering if I could buy you a drink or something --
Look -- I was thinking about that time after the party --
No. Now I know it's pretty late and if you'd rather --
Uh -- The Taft Hotel.
What?
I'm just giving you the truth. There was a time when William Parrish liked the truth.
What is your uncle's name?
Oh, yes, of course, Ambassador O'Grady...
Jesus Christ, Miles. Get out!
My companion treated me with great civility, and asked me a thousand questions about England, which I answered as best I might. But this best, I am bound to say, was bad enough. I knew nothing about England, and I invented a thousand stories which I told him; described the king and the ministers to him, said the British ambassador in Berlin was my uncle, and promised my acquaintance a letter of recommendation to him.
This may be a very good inn for Germany, but it would not pass in old Ireland. Corbach is only a league off, let us push on for Corbach.
This is a very good inn. Shall we stop for dinner?
I don't care if it is Marilyn Monroe -- I'm already in bed -- and I've taken a sleeping pill -- so I'm afraid the answer is no.
Hiya, Buddy-boy. I'm in this bar on Sixty-first Street -- and I got to thinking about you -- and I figured I'd give you a little buzz.
We'll see. If it doesn't, what the hell, at least I gave it a shot.
Well, that's very nice of you -- but who is this?
Not to mention ketchup and hot peppers.
Yeah?
Well... why don't you move back?
Trying to be.
Whose?
Tell you what I'm going to let you handle this one. But only if you promise not to say anything to your momma. I've got a feeling she wouldn't understand.
Why are you doing this to me, Jack?
I want you to meet some people.
Well, even if I'm not the wolfman, I am crazy enough to do something like that. I mean, here I sit in Leicester Square talking to a corpse. I'm glad to see you, Jack.
To find the Man in Black, obviously.
Knock wood.
Where is the Austrian?
Don't bother me with trifles; after twenty years, at last, my father's soul will be at peace.
The only jobs are picking jobs. Picking apples is truly boring.
No, I'm not. I need a job.
You're a little overqualified, aren't you?
I think I'd probably like the apple business.
I never said they were boring.
Nurse! Oh God! Alex!
I will hear you... but not now, not here.
Cake walk. Both my dad and my brother went through it and made it, so I know I can.
Come and get it.
Maybe it'll fit my pinkie.
Just come and get it...right here!
We're not! Trust me! We're okay.
Would you... would you get the impression that I wanted to see it?
They must be broken. I'm hanging in my straps! We're inverted!
Nothing!
Can I at least keep the onion soup?
Can't you feel it? I'm hanging in my straps!
Go on, please -- five men -- 250,000 -- the French Underground --
Christine's dad -- he's been talking about bringing me into his property business. Showing me the ropes. And that's something, considering how long it took him to get over I'm not Armenian. So I'm thinking about it. But I don't know, might get a little incestuous. But Mike does pretty well. A lot of high-end commercial stuff.
So you're going to stop acting?
No way. This would just provide some stability is what I'm saying. I can always squeeze in an audition or a commercial here and there, you know, keep myself in the game in case something big comes along.
Uh-huh.
You think I'm making a mistake marrying Christine?
You're a true friend.
Will you shut-up!!!
I LOVE THIS MAN...YA HEAR ME JADED CITY... ...I'M DAFFY ABOUT THIS GUY AND I DON'T CARE WHO KNOWS IT!!!
Because it's a brilliant film. It's funny, violent, and the soundtrack kicks fucking ass.
...You are such a great guy. First the money, now this. Isn't he fabulous!?
No. I think you're a moron and I don't want to get into trouble.
Tch. You are so sweet...Now I know why you're saying this. ...You're afraid I'm in danger and you're trying to protect me.
I take it back - you're fucking deranged... And you're going to get yourself killed trying to get in there!
Twenty-eight hours! You're outta your gord.
You're a real honest to goodness good guy.
I'm not. Believe me. I'm scum.
Why would they care?
I'm-I'm-I'm gonna have a stroke.
Well, I'm sorry, I-I can't... I-I- I've gotta see a picture exactly from the start to the finish, 'cause- 'cause I'm anal.
I don't know now. You-you wanna go to another movie? So let's go see The Sorrow and the Pity.
Hey, can we not stand here and argue in front of everybody, 'cause I get embarrassed.
If you must know, yes. I don't know what to do. I can't stand that holier than thou bullshit and yet, I'm completely infatuated with her. She made me laugh.
Surely you've seen a man naked.
Twins, Max. Sixteen-year-olds. Can you imagine the mathematical possibilities?
Yes, sir.
In matters concerning the Household, I act on her behalf.
Fair enough.
I came down at the Queen's request. I'll take my orders from her.
Sacha, she's had enough.
That's so long ago, I don't remember.
I never make plans that far ahead.
Why don't we just rent it for the season?
Don't give it a thought. Only three million dollars a month!
No--come on. Should we rent or are we in a buying mood, dear?
Wowee ow wow! Let's take it for the summer.
Well--we're newlyweds.
Nothing worse than having to feel this way in front of you?
Nellie, you're a disgrace to depression.
Oh, hi Cue... Carl. Sorry.
They can't do that to me!
I'm busy, Duffy.
You're crazy. Where's Mac?
What?
Virgin birth -- ha! An entire religion, built on an oxymoron!
-- what?
And my chaise -- am I being denied the privilege of sitting -- of plopping down my ass --
Valcour. His chair.
Lois, why don't you at least get one of those automatic ones?
He will. All his things are still piled on the bed.
I don't know.
I never saw him ask her for advise before. But she volunteered plenty.
He had it hidden in the dresser! Well, at least it was in there. He took it out, went to the phone and called somebody long distance. -- His wife's jewelry was in the handbag. And something about it worried him. He was asking somebody advice over the phone.
Then why go there?
Because he's forced out at third! It's a force!
Because he must!
Not yet!
No, no! The runner on second goes to third! He's out there!
Oh no, it can't come now.
That's what I like about you. You think about a man's feelings. I'd like to go down to that newspaper and punch the fellow in the nose that's writing that stuff
Yes.
I wish dawdie was with us.
Ironic, isn't it?
Dude in the dress is Eddie Solomon, used to buy scag off a corner till he kicked it and found his happiness with crack and then started dealing himself. Word on the street was he was saving up for an operation.
I've been thinking about this, Mr. Hand. If I'm here... and you're here... doesn't that make it our time?
And you, my friend. I'll see you for a two-hour detention every afternoon this week.
You better save some for me, you swine!
Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
Nothin'. Want another drink?
Well, what's so funny?
First time for everything.
I don t know. He seems to delight in so much sisterly love, he might become determined.
Long enough to die. Listen, if you really want to die, that's your problem, but don't do it under my nose, okay?
The fool was asleep! If I weren't around, he'd already be dead!!! Is that who you want to live with?
Let me get my bag.
There's a girl in my place -- she took some sleeping pills -- you better come quick -- I can't wake her up.
I suppose Guinness will suffice.
Miss Vivian --
Do you think Lorna hates her? I don't think she hates her. I mean she may resent her a little...
Oh, are you kidding, man? She hates her.
Come on in.
What are you drinking?
Want a drink?
A flaw in your research, my dear. I grew up chewing shoe leather for breakfast.
Seen one billion, seen them all.
Oh, I don't care about the money.
It's been hell.
You don't know what it's like -- standing next to you in that elevator, day after day -- Good morning, Miss Kubelik -- Good night, Mr. Sheldrake -- I'm still crazy about you, Fran.
I don't believe you.
I never said goodbye, Fran.
The incredible thing about it is, I'm paying for her analysis and she's making progress and I'm getting screwed.
You?
Oh, you're changing your mind --
Dad, I don't know about this one --
What's the matter with this one? Wouldn't you like to have Imelda Marcos as your mother?
From the looks of those boys, the Ripper too.
Dad --
Tell him you know this is the worst, dumbest, cruelest moment to do this to him. But there it is, and he has to choose.
You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.
Ben -- I want you to give her a call.
Oh yes.
Oh say -- Elaine gets down from Berkeley on Saturday.
Slow going?
What? You look like the kind of guy that has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?
Oh no.
I do not suppose you could speed things up?
It's an experiment.
No. There's no behavior modification.
And when a given situation no longer corresponds to the normal faculties of the... original, the visitor suffers some sort of disconnected consciousness.
Yeah, but, what if this guy lived a billion, trillion years ago? Like, what if he was a cave man, and now he's dead?
I'M NOT PUSHING IT.
No thanks.
Sssssh.
I'm with Terry.
You set me up. For a story. You know what's crazy? I was actually considering waiting for you.
Last guy I would have figured. But he's part of it.
Stay with the maid. I'm gonna have a look around.
I don't ski.
You ever wear one of these?
Is that how you get most of your dates? Someone gives your name to someone else?
What about the other things you've reported? -- -- being followed on the --
How else do you meet them? Pimps?
Is that how you met the Dumper? -- Someone else gave --
I have some names the police gave me. Frank Ligourin. Will you tell me what --
No? Why not? You know something? Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday. Isn't that dumb?
I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody! Judy, what am I going to do? I can't go home again.
You cold?
You still pretty upset?
Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What? You still here?" Man!
What else is there?
Okay, now we have a good five minutes to have a nice peaceful talk.
Because you'd laugh.
Right - for the first time this year.
The human cash register. Got her hooks into the Schuyler kid, eh?
Come on, get going, get going!
Well - it's only April.
Yeah - and get us into a million dollar libel suit. It wouldn't be the first time. Now, you get over there and get a statement out of the old lady, the sister, or the kid. Any of them - but get it.
Get going where? I can write that yarn without stepping out of the office.
What expenses? All you need is carfare to Long Island. You'd better get a shave and a shine, because you, you're going to have a tough time getting in there as it is.
All right. Give me a voucher for expenses.
I know those bluenoses. Their ancestors refused to come over on the Mayflower because they didn't want to rub elbows with the tourists. So they swam over.
The question now is whether or not your brother still owns anything, Mrs De Moraes.
No --
First your brother, then Charles, now Scobie -- we've got to do something! Any minute now we could be assassinated! Would you do anything like that?
What? Assassinate somebody?
Hurry up and change -- I'm starved.
Let me know what you want -- I'll pick a suit that matches.
Hello, then.
-- just wonderful.
So did I. Now pack up a few basics and --
I wasn't gonna apologize, Sir. I was just gonna say it was worth it to feel like a real pilot again, even if it was only for five seconds.
How's everything?
Sir?
You liked that?
Sir, I --
Hale-what?
I'm not sure.
I just think they make this stuff a lot more complicated than it has to be.
The government
I am the government.
This is undeclared income.
And who's gonna find out?
I'm not sure.
I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
I gotta tell ya, Dave. I've been going over this a bunch of times and a lot of this stuff just doesn't add up. Who does these books?
Very much.
Take care.
Um --
No.
Sorry about that, Mrs. Heine. Shall I repeat the ques...
You can speak for what he said. Just like you did for Mr. Hooks...
Carl ever say he got one?
Thanks. But I'd like to hear what you're feeling...
You know, I almost believe that... you're like a warm breeze that's suddenly blown into my life... I said that to Leslie, once, at her funeral, remember?...
Yes... maybe it was.
He just said he had good reasons.
Who's this?
A doctor on the show... why?
What in the... What the hell is this? You've been holding out on me. All this fucking time!
Baker.
Teeth.
Baker.
Well--breakfast? Lunch?
They're falling out.
Aw--give a feller a break. My cards are on the table-- I want to know you. How about dining with me tonight?
Why not?
Heading north still?
Kathryn, you know I love you. I've always loved you.
Oh come on, Kathryn, it was just a contest.
That's not fair. You're taking all the fun out of it.
I can't believe you're reacting this way. You're just saying this because you lost the bet.
Come on -- let's get busy. Who gets your vote?
Billy Clanton, Wes Fuller, and Billy Claiborne. Now there's six Of 'em. This is like a bad dream.
I can't keep my mind on the show.
Like what?! What?
You consider your life easy.
Wouldn't your lie be a lot easier if you were not...
I give you that one... Nice packing.
No... Nervous. It would be very rough, Carol, if you weren't along.
Then don't.
I hate to say it...
I ran into complications.
I thought you were dumping the chick at the truck stop.
Yes, ma'am.
Son-of-a-gun. Me too.
I'm at marker eight-five.
Well... I mean like Lula bein' in a family way.
Lula tell you she's pregnant?
Couple grand or more'd give you two a leg up. Get you to the west coast, Mexico, most anyplace, with a few dollars in your jeans. I got it figured good, Sailor.
When did you talk to Lula?
Feed store keeps up to five K in their safe. Need me a good boy for back-up. Even split. You interested?
No... I don't think so, man.
Be easy, Sailor. There's two employees. I take one in the back to open the safe, you keep the other'n covered... You ain't plannin' on raisin' a fam'ly in Big Tuna, are ya?
Talked to her this afternoon... While you was out.
She really say she was pregnant?
... You married?
Why?
Okay, I will.
Aren't you listening, man? Love gives you wings.
Listen to me. Whatever you're doing, stop. Pull out.
Gin? Where the hell are you?
In the middle? You've got the Mask, why don't we have him?
Geronimo. When you're really in love, you'll jump. Off the top of the Empire State. Screaming 'Geronimo' the whole way down.
Love gives you wings. It makes you fly. I don't even call it love. I call it Geronimo.
Yes. I haven't lived. I've died a few times.
I had to be a damn Hemingway hero. Well I'll tell ya, the old man and the sea didn't go through half this shit.
Jesus, baby, you're so full of talk! Well, you ain't never really been a nigger, have you - livin' like that in your father's house! So just shut your mouth.
You seem a decent fellow. I hate to die.
You are ready, then?
Whether I am or not, you've been more than fair. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 30.
You really do have those thoughts, don't you?
What are their feelings?
What's the matter?
Not true. I think I'm making real progress on the microchip.
I met her on a bus coming from Miami. Been with her every minute. I'm in love with her, Joe.
For heaven's sake, Joe stop being an editor for just a minute. We've been friends for a long time, haven't we? You ought to know when I'm serious. This is on the level.
Listen, Pal you've got to get this money for me. Now. Minutes count. She's waiting for me in an auto camp outside of Philadelphia. I've got to get right back. You see, she doesn't know I'm gone. A guy can't propose to a girl without a cent in the world, can he?
Well, I'll be
You!
I am, Joe.
Now I know you're drunk. I'm going home. Don't annoy me any more.
Yeah.
Bye you guys. 88.
I ain't got time, Fred, honest. I'll see you after.
Pete, I want to talk to you!
Where he used to live. You can catch the Riot Squad -- it's just going out.
Where is he?
Pete, I've got a mighty unpleasant task to perf --
The professor asked me for it -- I thought it was for something scientific!
Did you actually give Williams that gun?
Well, if your breath is as sweet as your personality, I got a lot to look forward to. Adios.
And don't drink too much. I don't want you going to the dark side or passing out. Do you hear me? No going to the dark side.
It's the firs time I've seen you dressed like this. You look so clean and pretty.
Not that I don't have any respect for the law, but what's your problem, man?
Condensed milk - one of the truly great inventions.
I'll get another tin. Hana and the Patient are alone.
It's still there, the cannon, outside the museum. It was made of metal cups and bowls taken from every household in the city as tax, then melted down. Then later they fired the cannon at my people - comma - The natives.
So what do you really object to - the writer or what he's writing about?
What I really object to, Uncle, is your finishing all my condensed milk. And the message everywhere in your book - however slowly I read it - that the best destiny for India is to be ruled by the British.
Hana, we have discovered a shared please - the boy and I.
You like him, don't you? Your voice changes.
Did you hear? Twas the killing of the unicorn caused it.
Aye. Black Baron's mischief.
As a hummingbird returns to the fairest blossom.
The princess is dead.
Lamentable news, Jack... but tis the fate of the living concerns us now.
This is sad news, be it true.
Tis not the time to speak of cheer.
By loving you, with no hope of possessing you.
Deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me. If I do not know it, I am innocent.
You should lock your doors.
Thanks for telling me.
Sure. You switched the charts, didn't you?
How you doin' tonight, beautiful?
C'mon. What're ya tryin' to be? The Phantom Lady?
Well, for starters, what do you do? Where're ya from? What's your favorite color? Who's your favorite movie star? What kinda music do you like? What are your turn-ons and turn-offs? Do you have a fella? What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone? And, in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
What's all the fuss about? Is he in hiding?
Where are you from.
I don't care what nobody says, this bum Creed woulda never made it in the Thirties --
Creed's great.
Right on the flight line?
I don't know. It's a long way down to Florida.
When you look at architecture, try not to concern yourself with the pieces -- look at the building in its totalitarianism.
Deco.
That...? Vestibule.
Pleasure to meet you, Patrick.
I don't know what to...
-- where?
But you don't know where he is.
That leaves twenty for me. At my best, I could never defeat that many. I need Vizzini to plan. I have no gift for strategy. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 82.
That's all right.
What's the difference? He's got more heads than he needs.
Don't stop, nurse--I think I'm going to faint.
Oh sure, we'll be happy. What's the matter with your eyes?
Well, well, well! Gallagher, old pal! There you are. What did you run away for?
Sure, you ran away. Aren't you going to congratulate a guy?
Thanks, thanks.
The best commercial director in the business. I hail you.
Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
That idiot!
Because he won't understand and it will just hurt you... Jacques has been put on earth by complete mistake. And he's only waiting for one thing: that some God up there will turn him into a fish! How long has that moron been down there?
Oh!--dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you. A great loss to playwriting, and to dancing.
Ilsa Lund. That ought to put your mind to rest about my helping Laszlo escape. The last man I want to see in America.
-- Tuscarora --
Company outing or picnic or something like that.
Want me to imitate a stupid cop?
Yes, ma'am.
Can I ask you something? You only had one crew on the date rape piece, right?
Yes. You're not going to stick around for the farewell party?
Hold it down, okay?
Come over tomorrow and read it to me?
Dooler, you know Bob Sugar.
Look at it this way. He might achieve everything your son never did.
No, I'm sure.
That's okay.
I know. I'm sorry...
What?
Well I guess...
Viens, Jean-Louis -- we're going to have a treasure hunt.
He's all yours. I'll do Tex and Gideon. Take Jean-Louis with you -- and make sure you bolt the door from inside.
Scobie -- he's the one that objected.
I'll take that.
We'd better exchange keys. Here's mine.
What's wrong, Herman -- have you got something to hide? Then I take it there are no objections.
En garde.
Over my dead body.
If I read this Board right now, they want you to accept Bontecou's offer.
I sent telegrams, I guess the military traffic held them up.
What is there to say? They know what John Bontecou is -- and if they didn't, they know now.
Yes, you made your feeling abun- dantly clear. Now they want to do the same with theirs.
And you're a nice man, Quince.
You're an original, Joe. A little hard to figure, maybe...
You're welcome.
Thanks.
Now that's no way to spend your hard- earned money!
Hasn't been any big demand for tickets.
Picked it up in Shanghai -- which has also seen better days.
You have, perhaps, an ambulance outside?
Sorry about that...
That was good.
What-- we already talked to her. That's a dead end.
Yeah.
You're great.
Yeah, baby.
Hey, baby -- I'm gonna retire with you.
I'll see you later.
I don't, no matter what my sisters say, ok?
You guys wanna play some more poker?
What's the use? I can't win a pot.
You must be joking. I've been doing all my own reading since I was forty...you know.
Well, what about me?
I should have kept going. I-I have a sneaking feeling, a nagging sensation I should've kept walking and...
It's true. There's only one king... people need to be reminded of that. Nevertheless... Jeanne has done so much for us...
Right -- well, then we have something of an impasse. I tell you what -- I'll call the police -- and,	what can I say? -- If I'm wrong about the whole book-down-the-trousers scenario, I really apologize.
It's like nothing I've ever felt before. I think I'm going crazy.
I think it might've been this Lotte woman talking through me. Maxine likes to call me Lotte.
Are you really? I mean, we've done some pretty fucked up shit in our time but this... I mean, we're destroying an innocent girl. You do realize that.
Who are you calling?
Ronald, e-mail's for geeks and pedophiles. Be romantic. Write her another letter.
Takes months to know... They work little by little. Talking like this is exhausting.
Don't be pessimistic. It's not your style. Okay... Here I goes... Clearly a mistake. I have this -- what? Ailment... And my doctor -- a shrink... who I used to see all the time... he says 50 or 60 percent of the time a pill can really help. I hate pills. Very dangerous things, pills. "Hate," I am using the word "hate" about pills. My compliment is that when you came to my house that time and told me how you'd never -- well, you were there, you know... The next morning I started taking these pills.
Yes, but you see, someone else was talking through my mouth.
Shit!
Why not?
I know who you mean. I think about leaving here, but not to find them .
I mean your parents.
Yeah. But sometimes I wish I could meet mine, anyway.
Is this another one of those Sun Tzu Art of War tricks?
No.
Jack, are you okay?
What s going on here?
Like hell they can't. They can reach right in with their damn white hands and turn you off and on.
So what are we gonna do, Jack?
Well in the City of Philadelphia, God needs a little help!
Thank you.
Home of the brave!
Good shooting, Danny!
Elaine, I'm going back there. Just hold onto that stick and try to control this hunk of tin as best you can.
Kill the bastards!
Good shooting, Rafe!
What facts are those?
I lied to you, I didn't destroy the floppy disks.
Don't! I know about your husband. You still like girls, Beth?
Put your hands up!
Put your fucking hands up! Don't move.
Listen, man I'll tell you what I'll do. When I come back in the morning, I'll buy it back from you and give you ten dollars profit? What do you say?
All I'm asking is enough gas to get me to New York. The bag's worth twenty-five dollars.
What?
Before we go through with this, I just want you to be aware of the damage we're going to cause.
So how long is this trip?
The engine is still running.
Yes, ma'am!
Of course.
Sorry!
Well, I've seen him here and there. What's on your mind?
Jeez, it all looks like bad late-night cable.
Stu Miley.
Olive. - Where exactly am I?
Never.
Shit, shit, shit, shit. My car's gone!
Maybe it had something to do.
I won't be made to feel like I've done something wrong.
Shall we say -- a dollar?
What do you want me to say?
Anything you want.
I will.
Nothing it's just...I begining to understand you.
Tell me more. I want to know everything.
Well, it's enough for me.
I could pencil you in if you like?
Whoever they were, they didn't do any of the things parents are supposed to do. Dr. Larch did those things, and Nurse Edna, and Nurse Angela.
Otis Payne was never embarrassed about a thing in his life.
Dad--
Excuse me?
But I think I like you better this way...
I wouldn't know anything about that, sir.
Traveler.
I don't think so.
That's two bucks, Joe.
The customers? I don't know...
It's about me.
Tim, I have to tell you something.
I wouldn't go outside.
The table's fine if it had some cholesterol on it. Two sausages, six bacon strips, fries, three eggs over easy and coffee.
He got that one right.
I had a visit from the British Embassy. They think I'm a stray soccer hooligan.
Damn!
They're good guys..... Have you seen Holly?
Yeah. I tell you, they're one big happy family over there.
What else?
Do you know what they fought about that night he went away?
We were here two Christmases ago.
It's not that long.
Don't ask.
Oh yes. Jerry Maguire! My agent! This is a fierce, loving individual, I love this man, he is love, he is about love -- my ambassador of kwan.
Oh no. At long last Leon had found a mission. He d never have killed himself when glory beckoned. Your husband killed your brother. And thanks to you, almost got me killed too.
Not in the strict sense of the word, no. He was in too much of a hurry to kill me when we first met and too wasted in acid when I caught up with him later.
I doubt Friedman ever even met Leon, Deborah. Friedman dealt with select customers. As for my envelope, had he know where it was he wouldn t have mistaken me for a hitman called Lamont when we met in Los Angeles.
Chulo, one thing at a time.
We'll spend an hour with "Nymphos Without Pants"...
Then it's on to the real thing.
Come on.
Let's walk.
It's not safe. I shouldn't have brought you here.
I heard enough.
It's not gonna take long, Sam.
That s right.
That might depend on where you re going.
De Moraes? I was asked here by a Mrs Spitz.
Bring 1976 up.
No, Ma'am, we can't. We can get a roof and a fire and maybe Mrs. Wyatt knows something about taking care of sick people.
Have you truly read the book in question? Or did you run -- straightaway -- to the dog-eared pages?
But you've no right to publish! Behind my back, without my sanction!
But you implored me to write! For curative purposes, to stave off my madness --
What did you do? Bribe one of the guards?
Yes! It is! The paper's cheap, the type's too small --
Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr. Potter.
Don't touch anything.
I've heard of Blue Lou Boyle.
Thanks for dropping around.
What about me! I feel really weird. Like she cheated on me, not dad. Isn't that sick? I don't mean I wanted to sleep with her or anything but -- ya know -- being the only son. You're sort of made to feel like you're the prince of the kingdom, ya know? And in the back of your mind, you kind of think your mother doesn't need sex anymore because she has you.
Mmm. Hmm.
It's a very personal, very important thing. It's a family motto. So I want to share it with you. You ready?
No, it's okay, sir. Just a mixup with your secretary.
Whenever your're ready, Captain.
Yes.
Here it is. "Show me the money." Show. Me. The. Money. 36.
As a parent, that's my right
Why can't we agree on this?
When I shell out fifty, I expect results.
I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself.
Yeah. It certainly is.
And you'd feel like an awful sucker if you found yourself marching right in the middle of it, wouldn't you?
In a depressingly asexual way.
This is baloney!
He superimposed your head onto "Scarface."
Look. You were really high. Things happen.
I was with Valerie, I swear. This is Adrian's work. I've got to find him.
I think you're looking at him.
Yes?
What if you're not here tomorrow?
Whew.
Nothing. Not a thing. I'm right As the mail.
Vicky -- do you think, maybe...it's time for us to take the next step in our relationship?
Why not -- all that awaits me at home is a masturbating Welshman.
Yeah, it's such a perfect evening. Isn't this how you've always pictured it?
Yeah me. King! But she betrayed me. She robbed me of my dream.
More people... Gotta pick up where Zenovich left off. People from outside the department.
She just sat there, looking right at me.
What?!
They're coming around for another pass. You got extra weapons and ammo?
This ain't a little feud, Earl, it's World War Two!
You guys get those! Earl, Rafe, come with me!
No. You were there.
You were altogether asleep. You were dreaming.
Rita. Pass the wine.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Do me a favor -- His lungs, punch 'em out.
Yeah, that's right.
You name it, we shoot it.
Who's he?
The expensive kind.
Okay, I'm Eddie Felson. I shoot straight pool. You got any straight pool shooters in this here poolroom?
Thanks, Mick -- I'm gonna try.
Well, you got one now. Come on, fill 'er up.
How're the tips?
'Respected journalist'-- On your knees...
Yer lucky I'm here at all. I tell you, Jimmy--my feet'll never hold out.
...'Winner of the Golden Globe and the Edward R. Murrow award among others.' Tell 'em the name of your personal lawyer, his firm, his address, and phone number. Tell 'em about the mayor and the unemployment lines. You getting the idea?
That's the spirit!
What a charming idea for Moscow to surprise us with a lady comrade.
I'm sorry... I don't know how to ask the questions.
And this is evil? The guy had an aneurysm and now he's in a coma.
Tell me.
With Maya?
You know how often these pourers get hit on? I'm going for a swim. Get the blood flowing. Want to come?
For once I'm dead on the level-- --crazy about you!
So what should I wear?
No, no, no, Max, that's a very convenient out. Every time some group disagrees with you it's because of anti-Semitism.
Stop this nonsense! If you're in some sort of trouble I want to know about it.
Stop bullying me. Everybody's bullying me.
I wasn't --
Yes, you were -- you called it nonsense. Being murdered in cold blood isn't nonsense. Wait until it happens to you sometime.
I don't think I follow you.
He said if I told anybody it could prove fatal for them as well as me.
Who said?
That's what I'm not supposed to say.
Well, I'm in search of the Holy Grail.
We were neighbors for a couple for weeks on Sutton Place.
Want to what?
Well, Nick, that's your name, isn't it?
Mr. Gower! Mr. Gower! This is George Bailey! Don't you know me?
Look, Nick. What's wrong?
Yes.
At the sub-atomic level, particles obey their own logic. They connect in unimaginable ways.
A quantum one.
Could be.
Comrade Buljanoff...
Whatta you think?
I have no idea but it looks like a long way.
I did not.
Well, I to my work, you to yours. When can I see pages?
My tailor. Wants to be an actor. I have a few debts here and there. Well, that seems to be everybody. Did you see a Romeo?
Where did you go before?
Please. Don't.
We think in miles, not kilometers.
Who said anything about "loser?" Where do you get this word "loser?"
You're right but there are lots of good things... beautiful things...
If we had known we would have greeted you with flowers.
Leeloo! Listen to me! I'll take you on a vacation afterwards! A real vacation, this time, for as long as you want. Come on! You can do it!
You can sleep tomorrow... come on...
It's more than what you're worth.
Sure!
That's my bag.
And you must not be getting along too well right now, huh?
Look... I... I'm sorry. I don't want to be any part of this.
Look. Can I pay you properly? You don't have to tell him what you got. Send him forty-five bucks and blow the rest. Give it to charity. Or something.
That's why I'm trying to compromise. What about fifteen-hundred? They're worth five times that.
Good. You needn t worry about the Austrian anymore. He s dead. I ll be in touch.
Fine...
How s the boy doing?
He showed me a book with a picture of a couple caught kissing in a street...
You sure? What about before he turned up with the boy?
... No.
Did he mention anything about having an exhibition of his work?
Yes. Three thousand pounds. I still...
That's not good enough, Goddamit!
No, I don't have to believe you. The jury has to believe you and answers like he's lying or she's mistaken aren't going to convince them.
Why would she lie?
Michael -- get off the phone.
Because I'm expecting a call.
PG E corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in Hinkley.
Hey, I got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus I haven't billed a minute of my time since I started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like I'm rich or something.
We've got the PG E fuckers in Hinkley by the balls. But nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate PG E fuckers in San Francisco.
You're fine like that, Mom.
Then what does he want with you?
Good!
How do you do, ma'am.
He's smart.
That's cool.
As soon as you want.
I don't do that. That's just not for me...
What does that mean?!
Kurt's been feeding him.
Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
Yes, no.
That'd be great.
I'm just leaving.... do you have my jacket?
O.K., O.K., That's enough.
I told you lay off.
I guess I have. You were pretty little when they locked him up. I don't suppose you even remember that time I was gone two months.
Okeh, I was wrong. But you can't expect a fellow who never saw Lednov and never heard his name until a while ago to do too much worryin'. You've been sorta close mouthed about him.
You remember Jeff Rawson? -- We used to go fishing and hunting with him when you were so high.
Sure I remember. You went to Mexico lookin' for cattle.
It's all right with me if she teaches you, but I don't want you forgettin' your job.
I won't again.
That's what I told you then. Only he didn't. Lednov killed him.
Sure I do. Went off down to Mexico or something...
Breakfast.
Bonjour.
My twenty-five per cent. Approximately fifteen hundred bucks.
HOW MUCH?!
What's the difference where? I'll raise it. Is it all right if I have another drink?
What for? To play Fats again?
C'mon, c'mon, just give me the money.
Aw, Eddie.
Oh, you crumb. With that fifteen hundred I coulda beat him. That's all I needed, Charlie.
You wanna come back on the road with me, okay, the money's yours. But if you wanna give it to Minnesota Fats... nothing doing. What do you say?
Yeah, to play Fats again.
I'm happy, Miss Flaemm.
I never danced before -- in public.
Yes.
As you will.
We shall see who remains here the longer.
I think it would be much better if you went away.
I did not ask your advice.
How was it? I don't recall.
Make it out to cash!
I guess the news you d sent me after Friedman didn t go down too well, eh?
Uhh - martini?
Someone has to look after you. It could've been someone. It was before.
An accident?!
That's what you need!
Tell her how you don't sleep at night.
I don't think I have to now.
What's she talking about?
You needn't be embarrassed, madame. A lady as charming as you would, and should, get love letters.
What about me?
What?
Whatever you say, sir.
Hey! Where's that martini?!
Aww, what's the difference. I'm all washed up... When you're dead, ya stay dead... Hey, fella!
I'm going to bed now.
You're a whore?
"Heroes For Sale"?
Did you hurt yourself? Whatd'ya do? Step on a thumbtack?
What are you, a theater checker? You check up on the box office girls. Make sure they're not rippin' the place off.
Who?
You got that playing basketball?
Hope you're a good actor, Elliot.
Quiet down! Shhh! Where is she?
You gotta real nice face, you know? It's really a nice face.
How'd he die?
You don't have to help me.
I like it well done.
This is good. Uhh...
Where'd Johnny find you?
I was just showing Homer the orchards... kind of a geography lesson.
The trees are flak--antiaircraft fire from those geeks on the ground.
Okay...
What about the trees?
I just want to be alone. Is that okay?
Or we'll go somewhere. If you have the time.
Digger and George are with family in the Hamptons until Monday morning. Brevity is even more in order than usual.
Hi.
Stay there.
Jim Stark.
Come here.
No.
She what? When?
Nice, huh?
Beautiful.
Victoria and I used to like this view. Once we had a picnic here and drank a '95 Opus One. With smoked salmon and artichokes, but we didn't care.
Miles.
She has the best palate of any woman I've ever known. She could even differentiate Italian wines.
Miles, I gotta tell you something. Victoria's coming to the wedding.
I know. You told me. I'm okay with it.
Yeah, but that's not the whole story. She got remarried.
I can t believe it s not a disappointment to you! Jesus, Kate, I could ve been a thousand times the man I became. How could you do this to me? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
No. What? No. I know.
It's a long way to go for a date.
What does it mean?
Josie you owe it to yourself to go. For your writing. You're a natural.
Dad, can I talk to you about track?
Take it easy.
I have a B average.
I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
I thought we already had this out? Next year, if your grades are high enough--
Time to change her diaper.
Time to leave.
He hasn't played it in a long time.
Not at all.
Another precedent gone. This has been a very interesting evening. I'll call you a cab. Gasoline rationing, time of night.
Oh, it's my party.
Any time.
We'll come again.
I will.
How are you feeling about work?
No thanks.
Sure?
Good, lad... Here, Jack, give me a hand with the windlass... There's a good fellow...
One more turn...
Rise, Screwball, and into the basket with you.
Haven't heard a bird sing in days...
Who else?
...You know, for kids! Which is perfect for Hudsucker -- not that I claim to be any great genius; like they say, inspiration is 99 percent perspiration, and in my case I'd say it's at least twice that, but I gotta tell ya, Mr. Mussburger, sir, this sweet baby --
Wait a minute!
LULA!!!!
But I'm a robber and a manslaughterer and I haven't had any parental guidance.
The Good Witch...
Sheldrake?
Pure gold it is... plays a different note every time.
Care to make a small wager?
Tell you the truth, I don't know. I started when I was eighteen, driving for my Uncle Cully and his partner, Gus. They go into a bank this one time in Slidell, Gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. All three of us ended up in Angola.
George, glad you could make it, son. Hi, doll.
Basically. Yeah. If I go back now, I do a full thirty years, no time off. Can you imagine looking at that?
Does she know about us?
C'mon, Bert. Let me play him.
Bermuda... Rich, eh?
Where'd you meet this man?
I know you, Hildy, and I know what it would mean. It would kill you.
Well... anywhere in particular?
You know what I've been doing since I got home? Been working on a poem. It's about you. Sometimes it's kinda hard for me to say things - so I write 'em.
I wanted to thank you again for going out with me. Huh? Well, I don't know what I'd do without you. You've made up for all the fakes that I've met.
Couldn't sleep. Kinda wanted to talk to you. Do you mind?
I ain't so sure of that. If I was, maybe I'd feel different.
Nay. That's but to distract the casual visitor. A dwarf is too busy to suffer fools gladly.
Here, I'll show you what I mean. We'll start with this.
I've got a theory. Look. If I can get used to heights just a little at a time... progressively see?
Better to kill than be disturbed.
Here is a bold champion's reward; to serve as a dwarf's doorstop.
How often does he get like that?
How often is that?
Is she good in the hay? No point marryin' her just to find out. Is there, baby?
You're breaking my heart. Got to see a man about a dog.
You don't know where Loretta is?
Are you frightened?
Now, where is he?
Don't say that.
I know the story. A federal judge. He denied a man in prison an appeal for a new trial.
You do recognize it then?
In Jerry's safety deposit box.
Good. What else? Anything interesting?
Never enough.
There's nothing to be done about it.
I have scruples. Next.
Yes. You?
Something wrong with your legs?
When are you coming home?
What's her first name?
What's your friend's name?
Your stomach?
Sure. Thanks.
No. You warned me. I didn't listen, but you warned me.
I'm sorry for what I said about Wally needing you. It was... unnecessary.
But, Faith--
Phil, I think you should consider... fades as Vada walks off
You're a good man Nicholas.
No problem.
Well I know you're not crazy about taking Vada around tomorrow, so...I just want you to know I appreciate it though.
It's hard to imagine.
I don't know. When I met my wife, it was so clear. I just knew.
I don't think I could really describe it.
How?
He's dead.
I've got a friend in the Boston police department. He faxed me this this morning. I'll just give you the highlights. After a short stint as a petty thief, Patrick R. Healy graduated to armed robbery by the age of fourteen. At sixteen he committed his first murder -- a pretty teacher's aid named Molly Pettygrove. He was incarcerated until age twenty-two when, despite a grim psychological profile, the state was forced to release him. In his mid- twenties and again in his early thirties he was suspected of homicides in the states of Utah and Washington. Unfortunately, the bodies were so badly decomposed that there wasn't enough evidence to hold him, and on and on and so forth and so on.
I think you'd better sit down.
Mary, the man's a killer.
Well... I've got a little more news about your friend Healy.
I was. What are you reading?
And we didn't have to bring another present?
This is the last one before the wedding, right?
He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
Get out, Spike. I'm so sorry.
We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
Looks like a hold-up!
All right, Ma. I'll be back in about an hour, an hour anna half.
A "complimentary corsage."
Please? I'm dyin' of thirst in here.
Right.
Slow down, Homer--don't be in such a big hurry.
All right -- go ahead... you talk to the lawyer and I'll talk to the judge!
What?
Denham! Go back to the wall ... Tell'em to give me twelve hours to get back with Ann!
Worked in a watch factory?
Whoever. The point is, prices are goin' up, too. Better get your little black book out, Richard. We got some business to talk about.
I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
Morning, Sheriff.
Kennedy's a Catholic. He'll never win.
They found my eyelash.
What makes them think that?
We can't stay here.
Any particular reason?
From what I hear you couldn't hit a bull in the ass with a slingshot
What are you talking about?
Perhaps we ought to celebrate, Irene.
Call German.
I want you to throw this one at the bat rack.
Oh, you mean the suit. Harry kept all my old clothes. Fits okay, but it's a little big.
Evening, Doctor Lardner.
What's wrong?
You're right. Only you can do that.
Sssshh. Come here.
What time?
I'm having some people over for drinks right after the races. Why don't you all come over? Then about nine, ten o'clock we can play.
We'll be there.
It'll be like live television! Let's live on the edge a little. You and I can break the mold here!
What's the matter? What happened?
Here we go again...
You get that off the screen?
You noticed..
No, not at all! I mean, just the opposite, you're... you're beautiful!
So the defendant knew the deceased, your son, even then.
I don't want them here overnight.
Don't be afraid of that. Please keep them for me. Thank you. I knew I could trust you.
For how long?
Perhaps an hour, perhaps a little longer.
Look, goddamnit, I never asked you for a goddamn thing! I've tried to make your parental obligation as easy as possible. After Mom divorced you, did I ask you for anything? When I wouldn't see ya for six months to a year at a time, did you ever get your shit about it? No, it was always "OK", "No problem", "You're a busy guy, I understand". The whole time you were a drunk, did I ever point my finger at you and talk shit? No! Everybody else did. I never did. You see, I know that you're just a bad parent. You're not really very good at it. But I know you love me. I'm basically a pretty resourceful guy. If I didn't really need it I wouldn't ask. And if you say no, don't worry about it. I'm gone. No problems.
Some other time, Cecile.
Why can't we be together?
Shopping?
For the first time, yes. It'll pass.
Finger! I'm driving a cab now, not a space fighter!!
I don't need one.
Uh... at least fifty.
We have forty-eight hours, the time it needs to adapt itself to our living conditions.
Although knowing you as I do -- there will be no settlement. This time it will be complete and total annihilation.
Well, when this goes south -- promise you'll have dinner with me?
I figure a couple of months. That's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.
Fritz? What are you talking about? Who's Fritz?
Count Laszlo de Alm sy. The Officer is writing this down. A glance at his Corporal.
Please - I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please listen to me, this is a terrible mistake. Just stop, please, and listen to me. My wife is dying.
Hey! Hey! Stop this jeep! Let me out of here - there's a woman dying, there's a woman dying while I'm - Hey!
Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
Not exactly. Just thought I'd sit down and rest my dogs a minute. You know the next investigation we get into I hope it's got buildings with elevators in them. This one has been nothing but climbing stairs. And when we hit the top oor the folks are usually out.
Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
I had to shoot him! It was the only decent thing to do.
I'm sure it won't be difficult to find you.
I need a man who knows where I am.
Then we'll have to see what can be arranged.
You'll be sent a message.
Her Highness' Equerry.
There is to be no communication with other members of the household on matters concerning the court except through myself or one of the Equerries. No plans must be altered unless you are given prior authority by myself or a senior member of the household.
Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
That's a shame. I'll send the key right down. And about your promotion -- -- I'm sending that efficiency report right up to Mr. Sheldrake, in Personnel. I wouldn't be surprised if you heard from him before the day is over.
I don't know about that. You can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.
You know where my loyalties lie.
I'm waiting for the tell part.
This is just show and tell.
You're impressed with her, aren't you?
She's calling the shots now.
She reminds you of yourself. There's nobody you admire more.
She's good. Give her that. Almost as good as she thinks she is.
My antenna is up, it is fully extended, and I am picking up...what is it? It is, can it be? The boy is in el, u, v.
No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing. It's the theme of this party.
What about my motive? Now I can say I fucked a US Marshal. You think I will?
I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you.
Why are you mad?
I'm trying.
Oh no! UUH.
I'm gonna be an acrobat when I grow up.
I don't like touching fish, how do you pull the hook out without touching it?
Oh, I don't mean running about on all fours and howling at the moon. But in such a deranged state he could harm himself, or perhaps others.
Let's call the police and see if they can help us find our wandering boy.
You're going to take a big step, a big leap, and before you do, I just want one thing from you, miss. You stand up straight and admit you're special.
We'll worry about that later. Now come on, tell me that you're special.
I always wondered what you Mayors do when you're not cutting ribbons.
Look out where you're aiming, will you?
I'm not going!
I poisoned him.
I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're talking about, I know. Well, I've said too much. I . . . You're the Board here. You do what you want with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come without crawling to Potter. Come on, Uncle Billy!
I'm talking about - I'm not going out.
You don't pick your brother.
What kind?
So how's the cat food business?
Ahh -- thank you.
I want to know how Tom Grunemann got mixed up in it.
No, uh, my name is Craig Schwartz. I have an interview with Mr. Lester.
The guy came right at us!
Schwartz.
My child, I don't think its a great mystery what Craig's up to.
Thank you, Floris.
You followed your heart, my child, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.
Forget it.
Has she talked with you since prison?
Late night. You?
Because I had it named for you. I know it's not an official designation --
Yeah.
Considering the company you're in, that's a pretty arrogant attitude.
Yes sir.
I like that in a fighter pilot. It's okay to be confident. You have to think you're King Kong to want to try to land on carriers. Just keep in mind the other component of success...teamwork.
Oh, no, I...
-- I can't have every deadbeat on the Hudsucker payroll pestering me with their idiotic brainwaves!
Floating around out here, playin' hell with them bass--play a little cards, play a little golf, drink some beer--
I know. That's why I came back.
Would you take me back? Would they?
You think I shouldn't fly.
Hi, I'm out drinking champagne and roses... and I'm really happy. Leave a message. BEEP.
Got cash.
Just relax. Have you hit the cash machine?
Check.
Car clean? Plenty of gas?
Copped a tin of Altoids at the car wash.
Mints?
Mom...please.
You don't have a choice.
He's not spending the entire summer with another kid in Tahoe. If he leaves, I will follow him up there and I will drag him home by his nose ring. He can hate me. You can hate me. He can try to kill me while I sleep. You can call the police. You can call your husband or your attorney, but Sam is spending the summer with me. He's my son. He's sixteen. That's it.
Sounds great. Where do I sign up?
I did. Boy.
Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club.
Why?
The what?
You mean that... I-I-I-I flew three thousand miles to see you.
Air miles, you know. I mean, you know what that does to my stomach?
No. Yes, of course I'm mad, because you love me, I know that.
The usual, you know. Uh, tryin' t' write. I'm workin' on a play. Jesus. So whatta yuh saying? That you're not comin' back to New York with me?
Hello?
You're just stalling now.
You'd like to think that, wouldn't you? You've beaten my giant, which means you're exceptionally strong. So, you could have put the poison in your own goblet, trusting on your strength to save you. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you. But, you've also bested my Spaniard which means you must have studied. And in studying, you must have learned that man is mortal so you would have put the poison as far from yourself as possible, so I can clearly not choose the wine in front of me.
...No wine -- Bad for ya' brain.
I hope not . . . I've got to call on her this morning!
An example must be made!
Sure, I must drop in on the mad wench. Her wounds need soothing.
Not remotely. Because iocane comes from Australia, as everyone knows. And Australia is entirely peopled with criminals. And criminals are used to having people not trust them, as you are not trusted by me. So I can clearly not choose the wine in front of you.
Your Majesty!
Your Majesty
Wait till I get going! Where was I?
Well, you're honest, anyway.
It's different 'cause you keep your own apartment. Because you know it's there, we don't have to go to it, we don't have to deal with it, but it's like a-a-a free-floating life raft... that we know that we're not married.
Ye-ah. Was it... It was yours actually, but, uh, I approved it immediately.
No-what, what...? I... we live together, we sleep together, we eat together. Jesus, you don't want it to be like we're married, do yuh?
All right, granted, it has bad plumbing and bugs, but you-you say that like it's a negative thing. You know, bugs are-are-uh, entomology is a... ...rapidly growing field.
How- I don't want you to live with me? How- Whose idea was it?
Oh. I guess.
Louis, we were French!
Uncle Louis, you remember Enzo's mother Signora Molinari from Amorgos?
What?!
How nice.
Now, Lily--
Clear and rolling.
Let's get the hell outta here.
I hate to say I told you so.
Save it. We got a long haul.
We still on schedule?
Forty-two minutes ahead.
Olivier's in that, right?
Is it chicken?
Mrs. Raymond, this is delicious. Absolutely delicious.
You talked to Wendy?
It was a surprise, Mom.
That guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket.
Yeah, well. You know, Jack's pretty eager to get up to... you know, but, uh, yeah. We'll see how it goes.
You dump her and I'll give you cash.
That's not fair.
Lily, you must listen to me.
I'm hip. But you know, I'm comfortable here. It's easy work. I know what I'm doing. Everybody who works here is my buddy. I'm friendly with most of the customers. I just hang around and talk about comic books all day.
Now what do you want to talk about?
I'm twenty-seven.
How old are you?
How old are you?
It's okay. I want to talk to you.
I dream of death mostly.
We'll get it later. Irene, please.
I have an idiosyncrasy all my own. You'll notice my coat came first then the tie then the shirt now, according to Hoyle, the pants should come next. But that's where I'm different. go for the shoes first. After that I
She said I was so much like you. I said, No, I'm not. I'm like I am because of you, but I'm not you, not as good as you. Everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. But you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. You made me who I am.
You okay?
I was only going one way.
Young woman cut herself.
How is it?
Do you have a back up.
Just us.
A hot shower... I haven't changed clothes in two days.
What's your first move?
Maybe the Bureau. Or those bastards at Treasury. I'll take care of it. I hate this shit, Johnny. You cut their balls off for me. I'm counting on you.
Six to the left. One to the right.
We got to find the leader. Mangalores don't fight without a leader.
Money problems?
Now tell him goodbye.
Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
A Donny Chiba triple feature. "The Streetfighter", "Return of the Streetfighter", and "Sister Streetfighter".
I'll drop the eighths.
No.
So?
I'm sorry, Homer.
But you've studied with the old man for years !
I'm not a doctor. I haven't been to medical school--I haven't even been to high school!
You're a doctor, Homer--you don't smell like ether.
He's a doctor, Buster--doctors smell like ether.
He sniffs that ether! I've seen him do it!
The rest meant nothing to me.
What did you say?
I had to get back to the desert. I made a promise. The rest meant nothing to me.
You were the only man who knew the desert well enough, the only man who would cross seventeen hundred miles of nothing.
And you thought you'd come and settle the score?
I see.
I'd seen you writing in that book. At the Embassy in Cairo, when I had thumbs and you had a face. And a name.
Me?
So, I come across the Hospital Convoy I was looking for this stuff, and some nurse, Mary, Hana's friend, tells me about you and Hana, hiding in a monastery, in purdah, whatever it is - retreat - how you'd come in from the Desert and you were burned and you didn't know your name but you knew the words to every song there was and you had one possession - - a copy of Herodotus - and it was full of letters and cuttings, and then I knew it must be you.
To bail Lisa out of jail.
How well my comfort is revived by this.
Forget it. I was joking.
No, I'm not married. It's for my daughter.
Hi.
Farewell.
We have to be strong, sweetheart. If not for ourselves, for the child.
Hi, honey! Feeling better?
Hot Dr. Pepper! Your favorite!
Burnt to a crisp. I've given you the most well-done cut.
Really?
I know, Jeanne... it was the only way to save you from the fire!
No, you don't! Get this clear: Socking people is no solution for anything.
I think I'll go down and punch this editor on the nose.
Erin --
I'm going to the show--
We're leaving.
And what'd you do to those bodyguards? They quit this morning. Said you locked them up.
What do I care about Arthur! Did you see this stuff in the paper? How'd it get in there? What'd you do last night? Who were you talking to?
What do you think bodyguards are for?
Oh, they insisted on following me.
Are those stories true?
What do they mean by this - "Cinderella Man!"
They'd call you anything if you gave them half a chance. They've got you down as a sap.
I don't remember. "Cinderella Man!" What do they mean by that?
Snoop, if you don't know where Glenn is...
Look, what you worried about Glenn for? What's he know?
If you took the trouble to write it, then sure, I'll take a look at it. But I'm beginning to think that maybe there's more to life than music. I wonder if people would still like me if I stopped being Mr. Excitement?
Does this mean you like me again?
Fat chance. You know, Lee Wilkins came to hear me last night. He told me to forget it. You told me to forget it. My parents tell me to forget it.
I thought everything.
I want to talk to you.
Oh, wait a minute, Miss Packard.
To win.
Yeah, I think we do. We could try to cut each other up. But that would be bad for everybody. Bad for me, bad for you. And worst of all, be bad for Eddie.
For what makes the world go round. For money, and for glory.
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun... At least I'm not bitching.
I never been to Montana... Acquaintance of mine has, but I hadn't... Never had any reason to.
Have you seen Debi Newberry?
Jack, you're on television.
Well, I've failed at everything else I've done and I can't hack it as a journalist, even for the Bugler.
It's a student magazine networked through Eastern Europe and funded by Republican do-gooders back in the States.
Ivory.
Oh?
This brand.
Is Johnny in?
Hey, what do you want to do? Grow a beard?
Which is why we bid out a quarter of our projects. It doesn't make a lot of sense anymore to want what we don't have and don't want what we do.
I'm not.
All of us are typing and clicking, George. Whether we want to, or not.
Typing and clicking myself to renderings isn't why I started building models.
This isn't me. We can show clients endless options, change anything in a matter of hours on the computer. But you won't change.
Well, that's sort of...you're sure you're not hungry?
I did tell you, didn't I? That I'd be ready to start the Berlin model today?
Peter Webber! Right. Quite the spotlight on that guy.
Maybe that's too long.
I've been here twenty years.
Have you read the story on Elvis?
Hmm..Smells good. Cheers!
I think you're real cute.
I knew it--you're seducing me!
No! You're playing with my mind!
Get out of my way.
Yo, Rocky -- Look at this mirror. I'd like to kill the friggin' moron who broke this mirror.
What?
Your sister's givin' me the shoulder.
Hey, how's my buddy doin'? -- Nice dog -- Well, I'll see ya later.
Yo, Paulie.
Jerry's visits to your office. Why do you tolerate them? Why him?
Forget her. You could do better than my sister.
Every mornin', every night I pass by -- I smile. I say jokes. Nothin'. She looks at me.
No, Mrs. Lampert.
Well, if I'm going to die, I might as well do it for my country.
I wouldn't advise that, Mrs. Lampert. You'd better consider what happened to your husband when he tried to leave. Those men won't be very far away -- no matter where you go. In fact, I don't even see any point in your changing hotels. Please help us, Mrs. Lampert. Your government is counting on you.
I'm sorry, Mr. Bartholomew, but nothing you've told me has changed my mind. I still intend leaving Paris -- tonight.
So you're talking to me?
Oh, stop it. What do you want me to do?
Yeah, with a finish in about a decade.
What if I was a relative?
What here?
Excuse me. Yes?
Well, then, what can I do for Scotland Yard?
You're really flipped--aren't you.
Maybe.
Respect, I always dished ya respect.
...Ya gave Dipper my locker.
What about her?
I mean, how did that happen?
In your motorcycle example. Those injuries are produced by the head being propelled against an object. Rather than the reverse, yes?
You're trying to make me feel guilty.
Meaning that he wasn't murdered first, say on the deck of the boat, and then thrown overboard.
The fight's set -- I don't need a manager.
But the nearest shelter's the Wyatt ranch and that's maybe five hours away.
Look, you can't buy what I know. Ya can't. I've seen it all! I got pain an' I got experience.
Now just a minute, I
Why? Is he staying?
I got pain an' experience too.
Wait a minute--What is next month?
Next month is June.
Fine! Instead of saying "next month"--we'll use one word and say "June."
June? That's my wife's name.
Sure.
Cut it out.
Of course.
Send that.
Please, kid.
Packs everything, including a gun. Okay, sister, you've got yourself a deal. Now let's take a look at the candidates. The one we pick has gotta be the typical average man. Typical American that can keep his mouth shut.
-- is not a challenge. I need something I can sink my teeth into, professionally speaking.
Who was that?
You only smoked three cigarettes through the entire state of Mississippi.
I'm proud of you.
Put it to you this way -- you're gonna have to pry her out of the bed with a spatula, mister.
I'm proud of you, lad.
A year is a long time.
Now is your chance to find out.
Too late for that. We're closer to the other side.
I'm 'bout four miles ahead of you, turkey.
Who?
Who?
Where'd they teach you to talk like this -- some Panama City "Sailor want to hump-hump bar"? Or was today getaway day and your last shot at his whiskey. Sell crazy some place else -- we're all stocked up here.
Woogie from Borrington high? Sounds like a loser.
Yeah, just a minor encounter with the shrew.
That's yes?
Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
Sorry. I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
Speaking.
It's not exactly him.
Yeah, I don't know, we'll see about that.
Yes no not really.
Ok....well...I'm gonna go.
It was nice to see you again, to see your face again, to go out with you --
Yeah.
Well, let's go down and ask him.
That's not how we work here. You don't just leave a message and take off.
Breaker, Breaker. This is Bandit I, coming up on a portable gas station. Do you copy?
Erin, you've been gone for a week.
Sleep for a week. Wanna join me?
Do as I say.
Oww... Did you have to make these things so tight?
No, I didn't have to.
I figure we could go to New York, catch the Knicks, and since we'd be there anyway, obviously we'd go to the Empire State Building --
I know that. I'm just -- I'm nervous. I reached out and grabbed the first thing out there. I know they're song lyrics. And I know how I feel.
Oh, Christ, here it comes. Look, I know you think I'm crazy. I don't think I am, but...
I don't know what to say. I love you.
I -- It's like, I resolve to call you up 1000 times a day. To ask you if you'll marry me in some old-fashioned way. Everything you do is magic.
What if I reached a point where you didn't think I was crazy anymore? If I was normal.
And?
What now?
Where'd she go?
Yeah, yeah. Remind me of that when I'm filing for bankruptcy.
No -- I was just talking to one of the guys at the office.
Oh. I wonder what's keeping mother? She was supposed to come down and get you.
That's lovely.
Kinda like David and what's-his-name's whole fucking family. Okay, here's the deal -- if, and only if, you find me the evidence to back all this up -- I'll do it. I'll take it on.
Listen to me: It's all right. I've been expecting something.
No, sir.
Lauder, Sweet Pea!
No, sir!
Do you want to fuck me up the ass, boy? Is that why you called me a 'ewe'? Are you a queer?
I didn't call you anything before that.
You said, 'How're you?' I am not a 'ewe,' boy! A ewe is a female sheep, boy! Is that what you think I am, boy?
No.
No, sir!
No, sir.
Where are you from, boy?
Listen, Adele, the reason I called, that party is today instead of Sunday. About eight-thirty, like only a few hours from now. So you'll have to get hold of Buddy, whatever he might be doing...
Are ye afraid of me wine? Did your momma tell ye never to take food nor drink from the Wee Folk? Think if ye sup with the faeries you'll be enchanted?
It looks... er, delicious... Such a fine bouquet... very aromatic...
Generally known! What general ever knew more than to lace up his boots?
Well... I... I don't want to be rude, but... it's generally known that --
What does she want from me?
Why, Jack-lad, she likes you, is all. And what hot-blooded hero wouldn't welcome the affections of a fair nymph like Oona here...? If your blood runs so cold, boy, you be a corpse before your time.
Elderberry wine. No finer drink under heaven.
He is afraid of enchantment! Will you listen to the fool prattle on.
Please don't misunderstand. I am grateful for your hospitality and --
No.
You're lovelier this morning than you have ever been.
You smell like coconuts.
No thanks. I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to give Ozzy the focus he deserves.
Little less.
Land of the free.
Well, I don't know. I
No - I don't want it, thank you.
Well I'm gonna teach creative writing this summer, so, I'm doing some work.
A sociopath kills for no reason. I kill for money.
Thirty five dollars.
Yeah. But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car.
I am happy to say that this bag is officially empty.
What?
Well yeah, otherwise it just sort, you know, lies there -- layer so it kind of fluffs out --
You ruined my life.
Everybody but us.
Great move. Great
He should've had me. GOOSE Take it down. Let's bug out of here. Call for a draw.
I was talking about our marriage.
I'm fine. Who is this?
Hello?
Leon... Leonitchka... Why are you so good to us?
Leon, my little boy.
Not that we are giving in one inch, but tell us... what is in your mind?
Well, gentlemen, how about my proposition?
What?!
Bed.
My life was totally crappy, Herb, and she... fixed it. She made me happy. Which I'd never been. She loves me the way I am - right now. I don't want everything to change. I don't want her saying yes to some big success. I just want her saying yes to me.
I got the ring. Tonight's the night, Herb. Tonight's the night.
Herb. I have to go.
I don't want to be rich. It's just a trap!
Herb, it's too much. It's all out of hand.
Huh? Well listen to him! Do you hear that?
Why?
If we don't... I'm going to beat you.
Cut.
A cemetery?
Gin.
Too slow?
They'll believe it because they want to believe it.
Shouldn't we tell Homer?
I'll tell them Fuzzy was adopted.
Why would the little ones believe that anyone would adopt him?
If Homer wanted to know what was happening here, he could pick up a telephone and call us.
You know what it feels like to throw a three hitter? We better not fuck.
Not that. I mean the re-channeling of my sexual energy. Maybe we shouldn't make love for awhile.
Y'know, Annie, I been thinking if it works for one game, maybe it'll work for a whole buncha games.
You told him I was throwing a deuce, right?
Couple. Want to help?
Oh, yes. She's the best operator in the building.
That Kubelik -- boy! Would I like to get her on a slow elevator to China.
I should have stayed in bed last night.
What is it?
Something's coming.
Pregnant, is she?
It would appear so.
Maybe you're using the wrong approach.
I'm a pretty good operator myself -- but she just won't give me a tumble -- date-wise.
Mr. Appleton, do you know an "Albert Lucas Trumbo?"
Luke Trumbo? We never met. But I'd like to think I know him.
Is that because you were masquerading as Luke Trumbo while you were in Lawson?
Mr. Clyde you're twisting things around. I wasn't masquerading. Luke Trumbo... Luke was a good man who gave his life for his country. I just... happen to look a little bit like him. That's all.
Sir, that is true.
Yes, I see that Private Trumbo was reported missing in action and is presumed dead. I also see that you were posted stateside during the war. Fort Dix?
Yes, sir.
I'm not open. We were just talking.
Look, either come in or stay out!
Oh, I'm sorry.
Moving along quite well.
I hate it too.
Oh sis. You're so tense.
Any day now.
That's all I ever wanted!
I won't.
I'll help you...!
Oh, I'm here, all right. I'm very here. Question is, why aren't you here?
You there?
Don't go making it too simple, we're on the cutting edge here.
Great. And your all set for the performance?
Don't worry. Thanks.
I can't really go into it right now. I'll just tell you it's someone big.
So what about you Cowboys anyway?
I'm not a lawman, I'm just a Private citizen getting' my Property back
Uh-huh.
Yeah, but some of the things they Say your brothers've done...
She just called. She doesn't even know. It's probably the last time I'll ever hear her voice. That's weird, isn't it? You spend Christmas at somebody's house, you know, and you worry about their operations and you see them in their bathrobe, and... I dunno...
How would I know? Gone. Girlfriend. Leave. Not say where gone. Laura move out.
She left. She's gone.
So so. Up and down.
I'm not doing any tutoring this year. I'm too busy.
Maybe this'll make you feel better.
Tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for Christmas.
And what happens when you lose?
No.
Sarah Lawrence is on the other side of the country.
I thought we decided you were going to school here. At U of 0.
Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that really helps people. Of course, we don't help you much when you're alive -- but afterward -- that's what counts.
I see what you mean.
I sometimes wish I'd taken out insurance -- but, of course, now it doesn't matter. Still, I suppose it would have been the smart thing to do.
I don't blame them.
How's business, Bruce?
Well, Albany's a mighty good insurance town. Most people there take it out pretty early in life.
Yes, I know... Hildy, will you ever forget the night you brought the Governor back to your hotel room and found me taking a bath? She didn't even know I was in town...
Didn't we already have this conversation?
Leave me alone.
Ugh.
Leave me alone!
Totally.
Merv, I'm thinking... I've only got about four good hours of surfing left before these little clowns from junior high start showing up with their boogie boards.
What?
Don't go starting rumors, Jim. My son's college bound with or without basketball.
Yeah, it is.
No kidding.
No shit.
But you're the one I want to tell what you said over Nolan about keepin' silent when you know the score I'm guilty you hear me? I'm guilty... .
You... fucked her! Goddamn dumb sonofabitch... You fucked her! Goddamn, you are one dumb sonofabitch --
I wasn't there last night, either.
I went over last night, too.
Easy there, partner -- I wasn't there.
I know.
I don't give a... flyin'... chili- bean... fart about AIDS!
I'm not gonna get AIDS, pop --don't worry about it. I always use a rubber.
Not exactly...
Oh, Jesus!
They're going to come and visit you in here?
Yes, I know. You are a good woman.
I don t think so.
Trouble at work?
I read somewhere that the suicide rate doubles during the holidays...
I m having kind of a bad day.
Is it...?
What am I saying? You don t need to hear that... All I meant was a lot of people have a hard time dealing with all the forced reverie, that s all. Is that you?
We re friends, aren t we?
Maybe I don t say it enough but you moving in next door to me...
I know your mad at me, okay, but I can't let you do this.
Since we're being honest, guess I should tell you. I'm dropping out of school and going pro.
I'm saying I handled my responsibilities like a man. But when you're in the NBA, you pull into a city and there's a hundred women waiting at the hotel. And another twenty that made it past security on your floor. And the boldest one is standing right at your door. And after awhile, it just becomes part of the game. I'm sorry I lied to you, I shouldn't have. But I did it cause I love you.
So now you're saying my mother trapped you?
Your mom was real quick to show you those pictures, wasn't she? Well, she was nineteen when she got pregnant and don't get me wrong, you're the best thing in my life, but she knew I wasn't ready for no marriage.
Every American should see the Grand Canyon. Are you an American?
Do you hear yourself right now...? Like a fucking madman...
"When I grow up I'm going to become a nurse or a veterinarian. I always want to help people and value all life, be it animal, plant or mineral..." Does that sound like a goddamn showgirl to you?
I said, 'No.' N-O.
Yes, I am and we're not going. Act professional.
I FUCKED HER COUNTLESS TIMES! IN EVERY ORIFICE! AND ALL THE WHILE, SHE PLEAD FOR MORE --
We inspected the body, Marquis. She died a virgin.
Now, while I freely admit total ignorance on the subject, I have heard of Bruce Lee. And I was under the impression that Bruce Lee was one of the, if not the greatest fighter in the history of martial arts.
Point of fact, weren't Tim's hands registered as lethal weapons?
So, I think it would be safe to say that anybody who studied the fighting style that Bruce Lee, arguably the greatest martial artist of all times, developed for nine years, that would be a fella who could defend himself. Would you describe Tim that way, Grace?
Yeah.
Said he'd be home later.
Yup.
I'm not gonna get anywhere punching a clock just so my wife doesn't get an attitude.
That ' s what I thought
'Certainly. And little Johnny?'
I had him out this morning.
Hello, baby.
You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary?
Your name?
Okay.
Why d'you think these seats were empty.
Vegetables.
Today I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth.
Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother.
I had to acknowledge a delivery. Mother, I'd like you to meet...
But you were coming up anyway, remember?
Right next to the one you already had.
Yeah. French fries...
It killed him... You coulda just used Draino. It's cheaper.
I told him it wasn't ready...
Why not?
I guess maybe I won't write that book after all.
Oh, that's nothing. Now take number three, for instance. That's a pip. It's the pathetic one. When you're broke and hungry and everything looks black. It's a long movement like this with a follow through.
Now watch me. I'm going to use Number One. Keep your eye on that thumb, baby, and see what happens.
Something must have gone wrong. I guess I'll try number two.
I'm not Nicky. I'm not home! I don't live here!
Snow thinks we shouldn't leave until we figure out a way to document it, to prove its existence to the planet Earth. This is hilarious: He thinks it's God, but he wants it to sit still for a photograph so he can show the folks back home.
If you take enough of it, your intestines lose their ability to absorb Vitamin C.
In other words, scurvy.
Yeah, most likely.
Save you from a big mistake with that other guy.
I could be, too.
Well, it is. It is that, too.
It's not that.
People watched the movies in their cars?
A movie outside ?
Look Anne, you're not serious about this, are you?
Yes! I've only seen one, though.
Thank you for the guided tour, but would you mind telling me what we re doing here?
I m sure I ll find a way.
Did you call me up here to enjoy yourself, Emily, or to let me use your phone? Because we seem to have a slight problem...
Yeah, where is the spider?
Tom Grunemann. He wrote you some letters.
Don't give me that. You've gotten plenty. You've been well-paid; you've gotten lots of perks ...
Inventin' jokes ain't easy.
This is good. Little hints of clove.
Nice. Very nice.
Simulates?
What kind of fossils?
Yeah? Well, she called Sue Ann yesterday from Arizona.
Listen! I saw 'Chloe' and 'Lonnie' on T.V. They're television characters.
No.
Tell him what you told me.
What the fuck is going on?
Are you sure you want to stay?
I gotta go... and I don't really like champagne.
It'll just be a few days.
Ok, definitely call them, I'll be back Friday. I love you.
Hi. Did you have a nice swim?
You did.
You taking any medication?
Of course, at once.
What is your name?
He's getting her drunk. That's what happened. Jesus, maybe he forced himself. That's why she couldn't tell us.
We're not doing anything wrong, do you.
Francesca?
I had no idea it's gotten that bad, sis.
Nice? He's trying to sleep with somebody's wife.
Then why do you?
Oh, here you are, Justice Zinnowitz -- I'm at cross-purposes with these gentlemen -- will you clear up the situation?
Good morning, gentlemen -- I see the conference is already underway.
Of course you took the initiative.
I can make no statement about Manchester at this time.
Foggy -- frightfully foggy, always, I'm told. Have you said anything about Manchester, Mr. Preysing?
How clear is Manchester?
But the situation is perfectly clear, If you will allow me --
Since, on the eleventh of June of this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger...
Tubab means white man.
No. I am a "tubab."
Yes?
Her show?
Jasmine... Do you have yesterday's show on tape, by any chance?
Well, Elliot wasn't supposed to tell you anythin'. Thanks a lot, bigmouth. I knew you were a squid the moment I laid eyes on you. In my book, buddy, you're a piece of shit. He's not a dirty cop, he's a good cop. He just saw his chance and he took it.
Why does he trust you?
We grew up together.
So you're going to kill her? Put the gun down Claire.
I found the pentacle.
You really had me going, Claire. I was finally ready to propose to you.
Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary?
Sure. I'll just leave 'em with the S.W.A.T. guy answers the door.
How do we do that?
Really. He has a cop's face.
Look who's talking.
Ouch. Come on, don't bust my chops. I know it's corny, but I do love it.
Well, that's exactly why I brought some Wisk for the jacuzzi.
Does Mom know you have company?
I know what day it is! Get off the phone.
I called you all weekend. Where were you?
Alone?
Could I ask you a couple of questions?
And some of it's mine. Edward, his jugular's exposed.
Please.
Thank you. I would. Nice.
No. I'm from out of town. I'm here on business.
Get out of here!
Bon soir, mademoiselle!
He tried to disconnect ROK. It gassed him. That computer is running this ship and we're heading right for the sun.
We're computer locked and the manual navigation unit is down.
What did he say?
They're still our friends, Annie. It's nothing serious. You kid about them all the time... And I could tell Paul really appreciated me being there.
Did you get a hold of that horse guy?
All our "favorite" people were there saying all their "favorite" things about their "favorite" subjects. I thought to myself, we've been friends with these people almost twenty years and nobody knows anybody. We're so afraid we won't like each other and have nobody go to dinners with.
Gimme ten bucks.
Make it twenty.
Okay?
Sit down.
What's the limit?
Cut.
Deal.
I'm sorry, it's just that you're taking this all wrong, pal. Don't you see? You're liberated. I feel liberated. I mean here you've been in therapy thinking you blew it with the greatest girl ever, and it turns out that getting your dick stuck in your zipper was the best thing that ever happened to you!
No one needs anything except food and shelter. The rest we just want.
I don't know, maybe you could poke around for a half day and see if she has five kids and a Labrador.
If you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. You understand what I'm saying?
Damn that Charlie I
He'll do better than that. I'll send him down to Miami on business, you throw him a couple bucks on the side, and he'll track her down.
Kat.
Well, I know you're busy...
All you want is a phone number?
You'll get official notification when I make my decision. He is out the door--Otis pulls himself a beer as Carolyn steps back out--
I gonna meet that family of yours?
I didn't follow you.
I always eat here.
But my dear child, I am most at home among working men. I hate the places where you circulate -- the Hotel Clarence... This is my natural element. After all, what are any of us? Workingmen! At least, those of us who are worth our salt. Hyah?
Rosebreen.
Tell him you love him. With all your heart.
Tell him you've loved him for nine years, but you were afraid to realize it.
Dad --
There's somebody on the phone for you. His name is Sam.
What is it?
Hello.
I'm probably not interested in whatever you're selling.
Who is this?
Weren't you expecting us?
Will they really teach me to shoot?
Ah, pleasure... that's a difficult word to define. When does the pain end and the pleasure begin...? When did your pleasure begin with that sword in your hand...?
Really?
Yeah...I guess I just wanted you to know, we could ve been really good friends...
You never really talked to me. I wanted to talk to you, man...
Ch...
Right.
She knew me from some bullshit dope bust. She drove me to court. Twice. You know what she said, we're in the car on the turnpike? "I never forget anybody I've cuffed and shackled."
Out for a little ride in the coun- try, Airk?
Yo, Benny.
Thank you, friend.
All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
Of course? I thought he was dead.
Starting tonight?
Right there, between your eyes -- see? Worry lines. You're much too young and too pretty to have anything like that. How about making me vice- president in charge of cheering you up?
Say, I want to be sure, too!
Why this is outrageous!...
Those same men will be sitting on the jury.
Are you busy on Friday?
She's innocent.
This is a very small town -- people here have very straight views on sex.
At a press conference.
What?
Presence.
Right. Now whenever he stands at a Podium, the President always puts one hand in the pocket of his coat...
Oh, sure. Remember the convention speech?
That's at a press conference. Otherwise he just puts em right out there.
I'm not certain about...
She don't say she is, but I figure she is -
Why do you say that?
Once I wanted five grand -- Cash -
So Jack, it s your wife s birthday, got anything to say to her?
It s your birthday? Today? What s your name? Where were you born?
'Bout twelve.
Listen. If that guy lays an egg. I want to get something out of it. I'm getting a Jane Doe ready!
There you are, Boss, just like you ordered. Symbols of the little people.
It's still a very sensitive memory for me.
Since he and his wife have been in custody, they've killed---
Don't recite the fact to me. I'm sure I know 'em better than you do.
Well, let me let you in on one more fact you obviously don't know. If I were to take my men away, Mickey Knox would snap your neck like a twig.
We got one...two...three...four ...five...six...seven...eight. I mean Jesus Christ, Phil, that's too much. Let's lose some of these guys.
Wayne, if it was anybody else---
Phil, I'm just scared he's gonna clam up on me with all these sheriffs all over the place. They hate him. He hates them. What kinda intimacy am I gonna create with all this hate in the air. Even you and I feel it.
She starts sniffing me.
No wonder he was looking at me like that.
Your real father was an Officer candidate like me?
Your real father?
Why'd your mom marry that guy if she didn't love him?
I'll try, but this week we go into survival training, so I can't make any promises. Well, thanks again for dinner. Thank your mom again for me, will you?
-- he'll never know the difference.
I'm telling you he won't know the difference.
I can't imagine being with Jill when she's fifty years old. I can't imagine not being with you.
What's wrong?
Now, that's practically uncut. You could, if you so desire, cut it a helluva lot more.
Can I get another one of these?
May I presume to ask you a question?
Oh, Denby--have you seen Sally around?
I've got you. I won't let go.
No--I'm looking for Miss Marsh myself. I thought you might know where she is--
Thank you, Mr. Leibel. Thank you very much.
I don't know. Do I?
Yeah, for a while.
They're fresh. I haven't eaten an egg in have you noticed there are chickens? You get chickens in Italy but no eggs. In Africa there were always eggs, but never chickens. Who separates them?
I met your friend Mary. She said I should stop and see if you were okay. Apparently we're neighbors - my house is two blocks from yours in Montreal. Cabot, north of Laurier. Bonjour.
Are you Hana?
I'd like to stay. That's the long and short of it. I mean, you know blah-blah if it's convenient, if there's room blah-blah-blah. I have to do some work here -I speak the language. There are Partisans to be - -we embrace them and see if we can relieve them of their weapons, you know - while we hug. I was a thief, so they think I'd be good at that.
That is of no interest.
Who was the friend?
H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
Comrade Kopalski...
Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
You did it for me.
Where is she now?
I don't son, but I got the minority opinion.
You think I --
Okay. I went after him. I lost my temper.
Poor little Grusinskaya! Does it do you good to cry? Are you afraid? Shall I go?
... to ensure our privacy. I need to talk to her. Alone.
That's right.
I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
Delly. I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father. And I'm not... I'm not Luke.
Holy Cow! What the heck are these?!
How'd you like to be thrown in the can on account of not remembering?
What was I supposed to do? I told the truth. Why should the truth upset you? It's not as if you're from a convent.
I want everybody to hear because I don't have anything to be ashamed of.
I had a good time last night. I really did.
There you are. Naomi, it's just... I'm afraid if we fall back into this fast without considering the problems we had...
You made no mistake sitting next to me. Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much.
Puppets. Maxine. It's the idea of being inside someone else, feeling what they feel, seeing what they see...
But I don't go in for that kinda stuff much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. "Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me, and the accent is on the fun, believe you me.
All right then.
Is that too much, Baron?
All right then.
No -- not at all.
Oh yes -- that's right -- look! I win, don't I --
No, I'm sure it'll be fine.
No luck on Williams, yet -- call you back.
Some Hallowe'en goin' on outside. The whole police force standing on it's ear.
And I didn't have an argument.
I dropped you off after. You said --
It's very late.
I was so nervous. I remember I couldn't think of anything to say. There were long silences.
I thought I was foolish. I thought I'd mistaken infatuation for love. You said:
How?
The Royal.
A gift. Courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, Mr. Daniels. We, dear brother, are a fucking smash. Yup. They want us back. Easter. It seems they have this egg hunt every year. Only not for kids. Adults. They stuff these plastic eggs with Timexes and little certificates for free Mai Tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn. Then afterwards, they have a dance. An egg dance. Everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open. It's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. Slippery business.
No, you're wrong. It's just beginning. Come on, have a drink. Show your big brother how it's done.
Expensive hangover.
Celebrating. Join me?
The party's over.
Right. The Royal. When's the last time we were there?
Couple years.
Well, she is cute.
Nah. I want to watch this.
I'm meditating, can't you see? Jacques does two hours of yoga before going down. I can take a five minute nap, can't I?
Cute? She's a fucking hottie. And you almost tell her I'm getting married. What's the matter with you? Gotta love it. Gotta love it.
Don't just become excited.
Don't worry, I'll desire. Boris, could I have some more coffee.
Take it easy.
Hello? Anybody there?
How you holdin' up, kid?
Are you asking me if I m gay for pay?
Could you take it just a little easy, Mr. Udall?
That's some face they left hanging on you. You look like...
He's a pain in the ass.
How's Verdell doing?
Okay by me.
No. He wants him back. He'll be by tomorrow.
It's been five weeks... another few won't kill me.
Simple deduction. It's fast. It's pretty. Sleek and stylish...It's your color...matches your lipstick.
You're not lost.
Your friend guaranteed my anonymity.
Max, if we lived in California, we could play outdoors every day, in the sun.
Sun is bad for yuh. Everything our parents said was good is bad. Sun, milk, red meat, college...
Max, the city is terribly worried.
But the- I'm not discussing politics or economics. This is foreskin.
I was walking past and I saw you in here...
Don't you see? The rest of the country looks upon New York like we're-we're left-wing Communist, Jewish, homosexual, pornographers. I think of us that way, sometimes, and I-I live here.
And what did she die of, exactly?
What's the medical explanation?
Oh, sure!
Thirty-eight minutes ahead of schedule.
This is Bandit II. Now, where the hell are you?
On two lane blacktop. Mile marker six-one. How we doin' on time?
You know, you're not a bad passenger.
Not for long, you ain't.
One cannot love and kill.
I'll try.
Yep! Right on it!
"Smooth's" the word.
Yes...yes...
Can you drive?
No... They don't kid.
You're kidding.
First thing they teach you at the academy. Don't give me gold and silver, or other worldly things, just the pride and glory of bleeding for my King.'
What's that?
Bleed for your king.'
You mean with you and everything?
I had a feeling.
Yeah, but Bob found me when I was stuck in Firearms and Tobacco...
But Bill was your king, not Bob.
How 'bout another cup of coffee?
-- This is my lucky day. I arrive in this big bad city and I not only find a doctor, a beautiful woman as well.
So if I needed a doctor, you could be it?
And I want to get into my apartment and go to work. Please, what do you say, another cup of coffee?
I'm not trying to make history. 67.
No.
There is something missing here.
Listen to me, it's over.
You know I didn't ever want to hurt you.
Yes.
May I interrupting?
'Just kidding'?
No.
I thought you'd heard a trillion times --
Well...I don't know.
This part I'm interested in.
Before I do -- I was hoping we might be alone, Bill.
Floris, you're very nice, but I'm afraid I m in love with somebody else.
I'll keep that in mind, sir.
No sir-e-bob, I don't die. But what I do is get older, wrinkled like a former plum that's become the wrinkled prune you see before you. Oh, to be a young man again, maybe then Floris would care for me.
I wasn't toying with her, sir. I was just... How old are you?
Oh, but it is mine too!
I said keep your nose out of my life. No kid is going to tell me how to run it.
You think you're so slmighty -- smart -- Who are you to sit up there and say nobody's good enough for you, like you said yesterday -- just because a man kisses a woman --
You keep your nose out of my life, young fella.
Maybe I haven't lived as long as you have, but I know a sight more about people and I wouldn't talk to a mule like you talked to her and, if I did, I'd say how sorry I was. I'd be man enough to do that.
I'm sorry.
Made a mistake -- remarkable. We shall soon see if you made a mistake. Stay here... Give me that money.
Where'd she go?
Where is she?
A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
Is she with you?
I mean real money -- not counterfeit!
That dumb immigrant'll flop on me. I know it. Can you imagine Butch doing this to me -- at a time like this?
Come here. See if we can move it.
That's not important now, Elaine. We have to talk.
Elaine.
I guess this is a first for you.
Frank's the best pilot in the program.
Are you on the Mercury mission?
That's right, Striker. And we're getting married when we return.
Yeah, okay.
I've never seen him before.
I never played a jewel thief.
I don't know.
Thank you.
Are there any questions?
What?
Then let's begin with the story itself. It's a story of the Grail myth...And although there are several variations, my favorite begins with the Fisher King as a young boy... who had to spend a night alone in the forest to prove his courage... and during that night, he is visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire, appears the Holy Grail - God's highest symbol of divine grace. And a voice says to the boy, "You shall be the guardian of the Grail, that it may heal the hearts of men"...But the boy was overcome ...Innocent and foolish, he was blinded by greater visions - a life ahead filled with beauty and glory, hope and power...Tears filled his eyes as he sensed his own... invincibility. A boy's tears of naive wonder and inspiration. and in this state of...radical amazement...he felt for a brief moment, not like a boy, but like God... ...And so he reached into the fire to take the Grail. And the Grail vanished. And the boy hands were left caught in the flames...leaving him wounded and ashamed at what his recklessness had lost him. When he became King, he was determined to reclaim his destiny and find the Grail... But with each year that passed, with each campaign he fought, the Grail remained lost, and this wound he suffered in the fire grew worse... He became a bitter man. Life for him lost it's reason. With each disappointment, with each betrayal... with each loss ... this wound would grow... Soon the land began to spoil from neglect and his people starved...Until finally, the King lost all faith in God's existance and in man's value...He lost his ability to love or be loved And he was so sick with experience... that he started to die. As the years went on, his bravest knights would search for the Grail that would heal their King and make them the most respected and valued men in the land, but to no avail. Pretty soon, finding the Grail became a ruthless struggle between ambitious men vying for the King's power, which only confirmed the King's worst suspicions of man, causing his wound to grow. His only hope, he thought, was death. Then one day, a fool was brought in to the King to cheer him. He was a simple-minded man... not particularly skilled...or admired... He tells the King some jokes...sing him some songs, but the King feels even worse...Finally, the fool says, "What is it that hurts you so much? How can I help?"...And the King says, "I need a sip of water to cool my throat"...So, the fool takes a cup from the bedstand, fills it with water and hands it to the King...Suddenly, the King feels a lot better. And when he looks to his hands, he sees that it was the Holy Grail the fool handed him...an ordinary cup that had been beside his bed all along...And the King asks, "How can this be?...how could you find what all my knights and wisest men could not find"? And the fool answers, "I don't know. I only knew you were thirsty."... And for the first time since he was a boy, the King felt more than a man - not because he was touched by God's glory...but rather, by the compassion of a fool.
I can't ask for her...I have to earn her.
How can you tell?
Then come with me.
I know - here I am always a brown man, there you would be always a white woman.
I mean home. India.
Oh no no -- no.
This is absurd.
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up. It never occurred to me to take her out.
Let's not talk about it. Let's not talk at all.
All right, for christ's sake. I promise I will never take out Elaine Robinson.
She said, "Will it change my wife." You heard that because you were there so I'm not crazy.
Your father should keep you better informed. He has bought me for you. He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday. You are allowed to show your pleasure.
You need to study?
It's not getting any longer.
What? This is a good level, isn't it?
Is it all right? Aren't you going to play something? ADA pulls up a chair and seats herself at the piano. She rubs her hands and places them lightly on the keys, she turns from habit over her left shoulder where STEWART waits crossed armed. Quickly she removes her hands, stands and gestures FLORA to play. FLORA proudly takes p the seat, she pulls her lips in trying to control her happiness to say in front of both her mother and STEWART.
Pearls. White gown. Beautiful.
We were playing the lounge one night and she came in.
Tell her.
Tomorrow
Play a gig.
I see.
There were no PG's. So I just gave them money to play games.
Depends on what I'd give up on.
I don't think she knows.
Fine, Bob. How are you?
Hello, Alabama.
Oh, well, I went to beauty school... you know you go to beauty school... and you get your operator's license... and you graduate... and you're a hairdresser.
Yeah, fine.
I set it for Wednesday. The ceremony. They're doing the stone today. It's okay? Wednesday?
Uh, we already boxed some things. I figured you'd want to go through Dad's stuff. It's in there. If you want to get started.
Oh ... I was just hoping for something to drink. But it seems the old lady was dry. Not even a bottle of cooking sherry.
Right.
Oh. Yeah. It was all worked out before, you know. She and Dad had taken care of it.
Is everything done? The arrangements, I mean.
Later.
Hello, Bobo. How are you tonight?
We will both have the Salad Ticino.
Hey, did you hear? Sands and Kantrowitz DORed last night. Survival of the fittest.
What?
Oh my. You mean, some people are born and never will become putterers?
No! Well, well, well! That's all right, if you like it. Can anybody do that?
Well, isn't that nice? You just go right ahead and putter with your hands. That's all right. How do you do it?
Hmmm, you just putter. Do you have to have a putter to putter?
I think that's it.
Oh my, wouldn't that be tragic? To know that you could never be a putterer.
Wounded? How?
The bayonet? Did you really?
Poor Ninotchka. Poor, poor Ninotchka.
I'd love to. Tsk, tsk, tsk.
Well, no. I think...I guess it would be good to be able to return the favor. I mean, it would be nice to know she enjoys things as much as I do.
What kind of a girl are you, anyway?
I got him on the knee!
God damn It, Jack, he still ain't touched the plate.
Huh?
All the time.
That's what it asked me. "What do you want?" I didn't answer. I was in the middle of an experiment.
Hello.
It's you.
Diane, in a million years, you could never be a... priss. It's all working out for you honey, don't you see? It's all working out, just like we planned. All the years of summer school, all the vacations you gave up, it's all working out just the way we planned...
But you know my name -- it's Dyle.
Well, you know now, so please tell me who you are.
I had to -- for all I knew you could have been in on the whole thing.
Why you lied to me.
No cat and mouse -- you've got me. What do you want to know?
It's the only name I've got. How about you?
Reggie?
Good morning, Mr. Dyle.
You're sometimes not sure?
Well, I hope you re not too heartbroken and...
Not far enough. Come on.
Jack?
It s Friday night, Jane. What happened to your latest boyfriend?
Oh shit. What is that?
A sheep dog or something. Turn slowly and let's walk away.
Nice doggie. Good boy.
Walk away, Jack.
Walking away, yes, sir. Here we are walking away.
See anything?
No.
It sounds far away.
Yes.
I've never been taken off an assignment in my life. Give me twenty- four hours and I'll have him for you.
I love to get pie after a movie.
Guess who I just saw, right by my store? Ian. In Starbuck's. Neat, huh?
Hey, how ya doin'?
Marcee --
I got it. You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.
I guess I am.
-- c'mon, I'll get you home...
-- good afternoon --
-- why did you come in today?
I've got to leave?
Do it.
With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls; For stony limits cannot hold love out, And what love can do that dares love attempt; Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
Hey -- you called me... I...
Better go on back and get some more sleep. You'll need it later on.
It's too light yet.
No, I'm not. All I want 'em to do is keep ahead of us -- a long way ahead. So I'm riding up the line aways to pick us out a new trail.
Nobody's gonna catch him sleeping. Don't worry about him.
Sometimes not knowin' how to read has its points. You can't read books so you look at people and figure 'em out.
You're right, there's more atmosphere where you're going.
Let's get out of here.
I gotta stop!! I gotta stop!!
Am I like Such a fellow?
Thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Verona.
Not the most popular opinion, but yes.
You live in Cory's parents' cabin?
What'd you do to her?
No - I've got a sweet-payin' job that I'm about to lose.
I don ' t know. I decided not to nail her when she was too drunk to remember it.
So you got cozy with she who stings?
I don't want old sad bastard music either. I just want something I can ignore.
At once, Jacques. We'll continue later.
Barnard Thomas, manager of the hotel.
Of course, yes. If you'll excuse me just a moment --
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Calling - are you reading this?
-- Thank you.
By the way, Monsieur, last night you evinced an interest in Signor Ugarte.
Yes.
I believe you have a message for him?
And what if you track down these men and kill them? What if you murdered all of us? From every corner of Europe, hundreds, thousands, would rise to take our places. Even Nazis can't kill that fast.
You won't dare to interfere with me here. This is still unoccupied France. Any violation of neutrality would reflect on Captain Renault.
Monsieur, insofar as it is in my power --
Right here. Sit down.
We need scissors over here! Who's got scissors? Okay, remember. Jack and I go on first, I do the set-up, then introduce you. And you say ...
Oh no...
What?
Its just a pseudonym, it doesn't matter.
I had to, Edie. I had to see you.
Yeah, alright.
Talk to him. You speak shellfish! Hey, look... put it in the pot.
Great, great. I hope you make it.
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Sure.
But then I won't be able to see anything.
But, I don't know how.
Like this?
No.
Well, there's a lot of boring stuff to do. Lists of people we have to write to. Find mama's relatives addresses in Italy -- stuff like that.
I said NO!
I should like to smoke.
I? -- Oh, no. I do only what I take pleasure in doing.
Because I can see something in the mirror that you cannot. My dear --
Were you, sir? Can you prove one word of all your fancy story?
No, sir, I can't. Not beyond a reasonable doubt.
I'm being controlled by the world's greatest puppeteer, Craig Schwartz...
I'll get right to the point, Larry. I'm a puppet now...
... and I want to show off his skills by performing a one-puppet extravaganza in Reno.
Yes.
Do you?
You're the first -- you're the first thing for so long that I've liked. The first person I could stand to be with.
It just happened. It was just this thing that happened along with everything else. Can you understand that?
No you mustn't, my child.
I'm moving. Remember? What's with the hooded cloak?
We need you on the inside, my child. To report on his comings and goings, and if need be, to... destroy him... ...for lack of a better word.
I expect you to look out for me, Pup, let me run off work details.
You should feed your animals. They're looking peaked.
... No. In fact, I d seen him a couple of months earlier. He was quite depressed. His work wasn t getting anywhere. He said he was going to try something new, realism, London in the nineties - documentary stuff, you know...
No, that's not it. Nothing like it.
Yeah, he needs souls to live. When you guys left, you broke the gates. We gotta get the gates burning again before he dies.
Well maybe you should go back and talk it over with him.
Why are you so stupid?
I don't want you to!
Hand me a towel. Hand me a towel.
I don't even...what do you mean? I don't even know what that means.
My stupid back.
They cooked the whole thing up without asking me.
He's a softy. Got him wrapped around my finger.
This is crazy --
You don't know anything about Joe --
I don't understand.
Alright, I'll talk to her
Get out of here.
Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
I'm supposed to be on vacation.
Yeah, well, Your's isn't. Let me run a comb though it.
Why?
I thought he was with you.
Don't give it to me. Don't!
You're goin' on a trip?
That's part of a very interesting airline promotion giveaway that's really tremendous. I'm going to start a collection of pudding and coupons that can be redeemed for frequent flyer miles through Healthy Choice and American Airlines --
What's with all this pudding, what is this?
Hi, Lance.
Good morning, Barry....
No. I'm sorry.
Hello again.
Uh, yes. Of course. After you.
So, you got a name by the way?
That's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down.
Jack.
Come on, stand still.
Are you out of your mind?
yes, we had, uh...
Don't you remember we-we-we discussed that thing that we were-
Remember, we had that thing.
And we could just sit and talk... nothing. Uh, not a big deal, it's just relax, just be very mellow.
Won't you join us?
I'll hit you, Frank. I swear.
Thank you. I hope you'll forgive me, Captain, but the present French administration has not always been so cordial. May I present Miss Ilsa Lund?
It's not gonna hurt you.
You didn't get any, did you? You're a homo.
And I'm on yours. Land of the free.
You don't wash your clothes at the Boulevard Laundromat... you don't pick up your kids from some crummy public school... what is this? A fuckin' joke?
I'm sorry.
What did you do tonight?
It's not my line.
I told you I was gonna hit you.
Now, I want you to lie down and drift off to slumberland.
Well?
I can get you a firm of private eyes to follow her for you. They're dependable, good boys --
I'm a loner, I'm not a monk.
You're so negative.
You know I want to...
Ninotchka, you can't walk out like this... I'm crazy about you, and I thought I'd made an impression on you. You liked the white of my eye.
But, Ninotchka, I held you in my arms. You kissed me!
Why not?
I don't know if I'd go that far.
Are you gonna be waking up next to 20 year old ballplayers when you're 60?
It's possible.
Yeah. Well -- that's the way it crumbles, cookie-wise. Go to sleep.
Lovely. You were a big help.
But I thought you could hold your tongue.
You bet it won't. I'll arrange for you to get a month's severance pay -- That's right, Miss Olsen. I'm letting you go.
You know you almost got us both Killed back there?
Lucked out -- got voice mail. Everything's cool.
What'd Christine say?
You golf?
Yeah, I reserved the tee time about a month ago.
Huh. Jack loves golf. Crazy about it.
No thanks.
Really? Yeah. Okay.
You mean with Malkovich?
Yeah. I've figured out how to hold on as long as I want. Oddly enough, it's all in the wrists.
Erin -- lemme tell you something. If I'da put three researchers on this, I wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. This is some damn good work.
Um-hum. Very good. Excellent!
I figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.
I read your report. I had to go along with it -- the idea of this being a wild goose chase, Tom being nowhere around --
The voice was in your cell?
What were you doing when the voice came?
When exactly? A day, a week -- when?
Evelyn, right?
I assure you they do. So... answer me... when was the last time you heard this voice?
Yeah.
What did it tell you?
When will they be back?
Don't know that I have... Should I know about you for anythin' in particular?
You really are dangerously cute, honey. I gotta admit it.
I told you to lock the door.
Get out of here.
Whoa!
Please don't tell anyone. This could ruin my career.
Your career? What about your family? Can you imagine the humiliation your father's going to feel when he finds out his pride and joy is a fudge- packer.
-- really drunk and blah blah blah blah blah.
Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
Too bad I couldn't see this guy first. I'm pretty particular about whom my wife marries.
Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
Yes. Very much.
Me! No. Of course not.
No.
Oh, it's fine. Fine.
Do you often model for Glaucus?
Just rolled them up and threw them in.
I'm not knocking it. It's a great solution. Not only the storage but you can see everything you have.
Who is this "he"?
Then... why are you here so often?
So... everything sounds... wonderful?
Hungry, anyway.
Not at all. You're light as a feather.
Stealing's stealing, we might as well get what we need. This'll do for the floor and the walkway too.
Look at it this way, it's their contribution. If we'd explained it to them, they'd probably have given it to us anyway.
Not yet, we need a few lengths of scaffold.
We don't speak Czech!
Francoise -
Say, could I meet him?
All right then, come on and let's see this paragon. Is he as good as you say?
I just have to do one little thing.
I won't screw you up.
I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel.
What?
You won't?
If necessary I can bring in the valet parking attendant and two customers who witnessed the occurrence.
And the argument was about the fact that you wanted to be romantically involved and she did not.
And after that didn't you continuously harass Miss Lawson?
He's capable of causing you a lot of trouble, Mr. Deeds.
How can he make any trouble for me? I haven't done anything.
A lawyer representing some woman with a claim against the estate. Tell him to see me at my office.
Well, if he has a claim, we'd better see him. Send him in.
Mrs. Semple?
Yes. Your uncle's common-law wife. She has a legal claim on the estate.
I've never heard about you.
No, I was looking at you.
Try a year and a half. He bands her an old snapshot. PILAR looks at it--
Buddy bought the cafe for her with money he took from the county. Pilar looks away, struggling not to cry--
You gonna tell your mother we been seeing each other?
You have any idea when your father died? Eladio?
Wait! Wait!
They like Dr. Pepper.
Hey! Pipe tobacco! I'm going to need all of this! This is swell!
My Mom and Dad.
I'm afraid your feet won't fit in there.
Big deal.
This is a totally barbaric custom.
Just wait one fucking minute.
How do you intend to disappear? you're probably the most famous couple in America.
I'm sick of looking at her mother- fucking face.
That was a really shitty thing to do.
What the hell's the matter with you?
Go for it.
This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
What? What does she represent?! What could some cornbread white bitch from Kansas who's dragging our sorry asses up and down the Louisiana Purchase possibly mean to you?!! I'd just love to know...
If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
No, darling. I'll tell you another story, a much better one. The only thing that will be over on Thursday is the lawsuit. There will be no Thursday for us. Not next week or any week. We won't let it happen. I'll tear it out of the calendar. Is that a good story?
You're very welcome. Countess, believe me, before you left this room I would have told you everything ... And let me say this with love in my heart-- Countess, you are a thief. The wallet of the gentleman in two fifty-three, five, seven, and nine is in your possession. I knew it very well when you took it out of my pocket. In fact, you tickled me. But your embrace was so sweet ...
What is?
I told you... The rabble, it s me... Huh... It s sad.
A thousand times the worse, to want thy light. Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
I've had a drink. Fatal.
That's just one of the privileges that goes with this job. You also get a nice little expense account, the use of the executive washroom -- Say, what happened to you, Baxter?
I got kicked in the head, too.
Swell. And don't think I've forgotten what you did for me. This way, Baxter.
You like? It's all yours.
Mine?
My assistant, Roy Thompson, has been shifted to the Denver office, and you're taking his place. What's the matter, Baxter? You don't seem very excited.
Well, it's just that so many things have been happening so fast -- I'm very pleased -- especially for Miss Kubelik. Now that I've gotten to know her better, I think she's the kind of girl that definitely ought to be married to somebody --
Oh, sure, sure. But first the property settlement has to be worked out -- then it takes six weeks in Reno -- meanwhile, I'm going to enjoy being a bachelor for a while. Oh, by the way, you can now have lunch in the executive dining room --
Yes, sir.
So thrive my soul--
Make it five.
Now just a minute, Major--
Why don't you go back to sleep. I'll go out and buy us some breakfast.
You seem very sure about that.
We?
I warned you... ...but I'm sorry.
That's amazing. What are you? Some sort of angel visiting me from one of my drunk fantasies? How can you be so good?
Like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.
But Carl was a fisherman. And successful at it.
Did you pay the guy the reward?
I just wanted to say that I've thought about everything, and I've decided something. I'm going to give you another chance. Maybe no one's listening, or maybe your father's listening. Mr Court, if you're listening to this, hello, how are you?
I appreciate this, Eddie, members of the Board, this will just take a minute of your time. As the custo- dians of the company, you may re- ceive information from what follows that is valuable to you -- -- or not. Either way, thanks.
I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim.
I guess she and I read the same gossip columns.
Mademoiselle Sultenfuss and the amazing Dr. J! How's the summer treating you?
Really? Already? The summer's just begun.
No wonder you're my prize pupil. What about you Thomas J?
Well I just bought it, now I'm fixing it up.
C'est absurde, Madame. To-tale-ment absurde!
I know. I'm sorry.
About how wealthy would you say?
I don't know.
He was a wealthy man?
I don't know. I suppose so.
Besides yourself, who is his nearest relation?
I don't know.
Where did he keep his money?
I don't know.
Yeah, group bloody therapy time.
Well she sure isn't normal.
I love the fragrance of chilidogs.
If I'd been careful piloting that reconnaissance plane, you wouldn't have taken the kind of pictures that got you a medal, a big job, fame, money --
All the things I hate.
Who was the trunk addressed to?
No. I don't think so--
You remember me?
I'm sorry--I made a mistake.
You mean my wang? Listen, it's running real late.
No, please! I Just want to talk to you!
That's fine.
I see she built a place up here by the river.
Don't joke. They might. So do me a favor and behave yourself for once. Ed Masry to see Kurt Potter.
It's eight million dollars, Erin. Eight million dollars.
Maybe. but maybe not. We still don't have anything linking this to PG E corporate. Plus, there's the statute problem. Plus, we're way short on manpower, so we'd need to bring on more lawyers ...
Three nights... two days.
You actually have clauses in your contact about nudity?
You have a stunt bottom?
My... ...car will take me... ...up there... home.
I do not understand.
Yes.
Yes. Day... night.
You don't understand...
What if I come back?
No further questions.
Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
No -- Madam Grusinskaya's car is to be brought.
Is that for me?
Annette, how long have we known each other?
From who?
Well, a lot of people are jealous cause he's loaded.
Not a whole lot. We take some classes together. He's got a bad rep, but it's mostly bullshit.
Is this all we got left?
Now it's my job to look out for you. You're like a kid sister to me. Do I look like some kind of gossip queen?
Fats, I got about two hundred dollars here.
If that's all you got, that's all we got left.
Jesus Christ, Sid! Is everything your responsibility?
hey. Great show, huh?
Okay, but what if it's like Foley said and she got knocked up, to trap you -- is it still your responsibility?
No matter how it happened, if she goes ahead and has it" Zack, there'll be a child in the world that's mine -- and I couldn't go through life knowing that and not knowing its name or where it lived.
Today at lunch, you asked me if I had any questions.
Do you know how many different kinds of laws we've broken?
It's simple, Alan. We send the Vice- President to Africa or something, dig up some dirt on him, force him to resign and get our President' to nominate a new one. The whole thing takes a few weeks tops.
You mean we get Dave' to nominate you as Vice President.
I was a senator, you know.
Oh, I know. And then when our poor President gets another stroke - - of course much more serious this time - - the newly appointed V.P. becomes the Pres...
What about containment, Alan?
The building has been occupied and the locks have been changed.
We're not sure...
Yes, I think so, it is still barred, but it is not the University who are in the building.
Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
No, you can tell me.
I... uh... I... uh... can't.
Wasn't sure it was you.
No.
I'll call you back.
It's me. Put the gun down. Maya...
Cigarette?
Jeanne, you've been badly wounded...
Beautiful specimen.
Eighteenth century.
I do her hair, yeah.
I speak as I find, Archie.
Not down south you don't.
So what did Ponsonby do when she started shouting?
I think he nearly ruptured his truss.
How much?
Seventy a year.
Not bad, not bad.
How about yourself?
Of course I knew your father. He was tall, thin, pleasant, and had a moustache like mine. Always smiling. He looked like Clark Gable.
Good morning, father. It's hard on the feet, huh?
Alfredo, did you know my father?
The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip.
Close that door. Will you get Mrs. Cedar on the phone, please?
We've got nothing to worry about. He's as naive as a child.
I didn't want to say it... but I had a feelin' Santos was up to somethin' with your mama...
'Bye, Jocko.
Oh . . .
I'm going to miss you, too, Pop. What's the matter? You look tired.
Stephanie, holy shit. Chick had it all going on.
Christ... Where the hell is the bathroom?
Why not?
What are you doing?
Trust me on this Kate. I really don t think going to a party is the right move for me at the present time.
Been divorced for a year now, bud.
Thank you.
We can finally consign my old bird to the scrapheap. Alm sy smiles and walks on towards the others.
Marvelous plane. Did you look?
A thing is still a thing no matter what you place in front of it. Big car, slow car, chauffeur-driven car, still a car.
And if what you're saying is true, what would happen to me?
So, just to clarify, I'm sorry: Ten purchases of any of your Healthy Choice products equals five hundred miles and then with the coupon the same purchases would value one thousand miles --
I'm looking at your advertisement for the airline promotion and giveaway?
It's hard to understand because it says in addition to but I can't exactly understand in addition to what because there's actually nothing to add it too...
Lee, Clarence . Please don't insult me. Call me Lee.
OK, sorry, Lee. I just wanna tell you "Coming Home in a Body Bag" is one of my favorite movies. After "Apocalypse Now" I think it's the best Vietnam movie ever.
Well, I have to admit, walkin' through the door and seein' these "Soldier of Fortune" poster boys made me a bit nervous. But, Lee, I'm fairly confident that you came here to do business, not to be a wise-guy. So, if you want, I'll put the gun on the table.
A lot of things. All I know is I'll be back in six months.
Sorry, Stu. It's all part of the deal. We've got big plans for that body of yours!
NO! DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND?? HE'S GOT MY E-TICKET! HE'S GOT MY -
So, how's pro-ball, Europe?
Don't joke around, little buddy. I mean it. I really do love y--
Awwww. Worried about my feelings, are you? Well, there's a new twist.
Funny. I never did.
Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
Loser? You?
I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
Exactly!
I'll keep you in mind.
It doesn't have to rhyme!
I don't know what that means.
I don't know any jokes about your name.
Sorry. It's a pretty name, though. It means "merciful", right?
I'm not nuts.
See, I wouldn't think that about you.
Where'd you learn to do this?
What do you mean?
Now that I'm seeing someone, it's a whole other thing.
It'll take him a while to come around. A month ago he called one of those radio call-in shows and told them I needed a wife --
I'm glad you like it. Now be quiet, I've really got to read these.
To meet some friends. Rudolpho, a poet... Benoit, a landlord... Mimi, a flower maker...
The opera.
Why don't you call me up tonight?
I don't sell my work by the yard!
Well, I kinda just blurted it out over a root beer float.
Okay, we need wallpaper paste. Hey Cece!
Oh yes, lovely funeral, Gernaldi brothers did a beautiful job, lots of pink roses...I used the white hearse. Hey, how about this flowered wallpaper for your room?
Would I?!! Why I oughta...
I found Lisa Henderson.
I did, too. She told me it was backwards -- she said you even styled your hair the way she did.
You should do something about this lock.
Really? So, so, what else? Wh- what are you up to?
How's Frederick? He didn't come.
Oh, great.
Two guys?
What?
In vino veritas.
Don't knock drunk guys in bars. Drunk guys in bars are good. It means they're not driving.
I didn't cook up a story. I had a source.
I merely write the stuff. You're the one that serves it up.
Which way did she fall?
Do one thing to me? Get me one shot at anchoring the Weekend News -- they've never seen me do it. I think it could turn them around.
Don't say that!
So do you what, you hoodoo! And now, Mr. Pinkus, if you'll come with us, we'll take you over to the Warden's office and deliver this reprieve.
So that was it.
To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
May I have a sandwich, please?
Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
Agent.
I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
Wanker more like, what does he know about writing.
What is it with that Josh guy? Who does he think he is shoving that Reflections rag down our throats?
So tell me everything. Details. I like details.
They said it would be okay if...
I just had a phone call.
I guess so...
Take my hand. I'll pull you back in.
It wasn't my truck -- I was helping out a guy in a wheelchair.
Uh... actually, picking apples is as much excitement as I want for a while. I'm grateful for the job.
No, no, just listen. You won the Wreath fellowship.
You wanted to see the propellers?
Who the fuck is it to you?
Hello...? Sully...? Sully, that you?
Jim Court... no, this is her father. I'll take...
Do you always say 'no' to everything?
I think we're falling in love.
Wow. You two really have something going, don't you?
It's true. I mean, after this, everything'll be different.
After high school.
After getting laid?
Fuck yeah we will.
Yeah, but we'll still see each other.
That's part of it.
Watch out for that glass.
If we find nothing, we get creative. Just make something up. Instead of a couple weeks it'll be a couple of months. The whole thing is under control.
Nobody's got clean kids.
We've got nothing, Bob. This won't work.
Terry... Terry... .
... What?
Look, I m sorry. I m sorry I was such a saint before and I m such a prick now. Maybe I m just not the same guy I was when we got married...
You won it. You're going to study at the finest institute at England, the toughest fellowship in the country, and you won.
I know. Amazing.
Who are these idiots?
Oh, this is wonderful...
Have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, Betty? I think there might be...
Pop, do you want a shock? I think you're a great guy.
That's not what you're saying. I know it's not the same. What you're saying is, it's not as good. Or it's not as normal or proper.
I'm a little sick of this American Family Ethic everyone seems to be hypnotized by in this country. I guess you think I'm just some poor displaced soul doomed to roam the earth without a self-cleaning oven and home movie.
I told you, I love other people.
No. But I love them just the same.
Do you want to leave your husband?
I can hear you walking around sometimes. At first I thought it was a robber. Go ahead, tell her, Dad.
I don't get it.
... It's hard you know. You're so far away and I don't know what else to say.
The what?
Give me a break, I'm asking you out.
I'm special.
Evan... or Maverick.
I thought there was something... That night in the club...
Your friend?
Just go off. I'll be quite all right.
Not too well. He taught at the Sorbonne, right? Dad always calls him his "hippie brother". Did some work with Timothy Leary I think, and - Is he... is he going to die?
No. The doctors say the machines should keep him going a long time. But basically he is, how you say, a legume.
Right. Listen, my uncle, it's not serious is it? Did he eat some bad snails? Slip on the bidet? What?
He's in charge but, uh, between you and me, my English is better. This way... So you're from New York eh? I love those Hill Street Blues...
Jesus...
How well did, er, do you know him?
He says -
Or Bambi... or, I don't know, Beavis or Butthead?
Lord, you're stubborn.
Let's look anyway.
But everyone and his Aunt Lilian's been through that bag. Somebody would have seen it.
The power of the press, huh!
Get out of here!
And you've checked the ram to be sure it's synchronized with the clock.
To the apartment -- it matches mine perfectly.
Long trip. Pretty nice of you to come.
... trouser width, this is all classic. Which means safe, something I'd wear.
What're you doing here?
Looks like we'll have to send someone down a lot of people are asking for help for a man named George Bailey.
Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q. of a rabbit.
Why?
Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess. Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco. Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this "television" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to.
Wait'll you see the inside!
Can't wait.
Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed?
Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight.
We've been closed for a while.
Ah.
"Fishbait," says Buddy, in that quiet way of his, "What you know about them tires that went missing from markets?" Fishbait thinks for a minute, then he lifts up a loose board from the porch floor and calls down into it, "C'mon out, Pooter, they caught us!"
Surrender!!
Do I recognize him? I recognize what he is. I like him. He's Canadian. He can read Italian. He can catch rabbits.
This is an incredible story - about a man hunting an Ostrich, he's been telling me about Zerzura, he thinks he's been there, but his map, the route he's describing, he couldn't survive the journey now, but he's a poet, so his map is poetry - and now we're onto an Ostrich. I'm telling her your map is poetry. The Arab shrugs.
I promised to protect her from people like you.
It'll be on the teleprompter with the rest of the speech.
Friend.
Nina?
I have to make him some chili. Okay?
She's four feet tall. Ed?
How come you didn't close your eyes?
Who else knows?
Starting with his own.
Bartholomew?
Then how do I know this is your office?
Around one.
What's your first name today?
That's fine, Stan.
I can't. I have to go home. I'll do it later.
I want 'im outta here -- Don't think I'm good enough to work for Gazzo? That's what I think of bums like you an' Gazzo! You're goin' up an' don't care enough to throw Paulie some crumbs! I give ya meat, an' I give ya my sister, too!
I'll go out for a smoke. If no one minds.
Hey...
What happened to the donut king?
Shrink, actually.
Eddie did.
Sounds big. What's he do?
Um, just about everyone.
No, you see, I don't really love him.
Right... Think it over.
Hey...hey!
Sister, do you ever get lonely after vespers? If you do, why don't you give me a call. I'm in the book.
I don't know.
Yes, I am -- I'm compulsive about it -- dishonesty infuriates me. Like when you go into a drugstore.
I don't like getting splashed.
My bed.
Mm.
Yes. Your dog is fine, Simon.
You are very certain my dog is okay... because you have no idea...
No, I promise... not a chance. I own this guy. There was no one else. I'm on the move too much. Trust me.
How could you do that? He'll hurt him.
Your neighbor -- Udall -- is taking care of him.
Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
No, Judy, I'm not going to move! Please! Stay in the chair!
Where the fuck is Foley?
Please! And don't look at me.
Dad's fishing trip, Grandma's knee operation, Grandma's birthday...
Ah, beautiful. I just can't see her leaving multiple grooms in the dust like that.
Really? And what is the kick of it? Because I never...
It's that they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows.
What do you mean? I'm just doing what we've always done.
Older than me.
Good.
Is that all the coke in the place?
The end.
Reach out and snort someone.
Dipper's a climber -- You're a tomato.
I can explain--
Maybe he'll ask your ma to marry him.
First times. Hey, look at this.
Suggestion! Hypnotic suggestion! Why didn't I think o that before?
...Hi.
No. Thanks. Gotta keep my wits for the drive home.
I understand that you're not very skilled yet in the secretarial arts. I'm not that skilled as president. Oh sure, I put up a big front -- -- not that everyone's buying it.
Uh... not really.
Didja ever go to the top of old man Larson's feed tower and look out over the town?
-- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
Jennifer.
Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
No.
I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
How 'bout this?
Hey, Ken. How have you been?
Hey, Bob.
That sounds pretty interesting...
Those all seem kind of related...
No. Thank you. Could you tell me if Leon Spitz is here, please?
All right -- it's said!
If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
Twenty years' experience, I couldn't shake you. You may be a great flyer. I mean that.
Yeah. It's quiet--
What's up?
I haven't seen anybody come by.
Tell me...
Where -- ?
Remember when we went hiking in the lake district and Amy was wearing that little bikini thing.
No, that s not it.
There s something about him that s just a bit odd.
Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
Are you planning to be the exception?
I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
You don't wanna know.
I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
I don't owe you anything; you don't owe me anything. We went to bed -- what was it? -- ten or fifteen times? It wasn't memorable enough to carry any obligations.
Yeah? Well why don't you find some friendly therapist and work some of that hostility out. But take my advice. Put a little more life into it than you usually do.
No. This can't be happening.
I've never been to Earth. I've never even slept over at some other dude's house!
You're not saying it's up to me?
Are you telling me I have to go to Earth and kill my brothers?
What's the point of this?
Good.
You can't go because of Sam?
Police...
Steering wheel... gear shift... dashboard...
Dashboard.
The address?!
Don't call him a dipshit.
And you don't. What's she doing in there?
Stop it, Homer. They aren't our rules. We didn't write them. I don't see no reason to read them.
It's almost like flying.
Fired! You're fired! Is that plain enough for you, buster!
The machine gave me two. Should I put one back?
On the radio they say it's good.
Good. But "love your enemies"... body and soul.
Me? No, no. I-I couldn't make it that ni- My-my raccoon had hepatitis.
Man, that's great. That's just great.
No, you're not either.
Cause I can't allow it.
It's....confidential, the call, my information is private.
......and this is confidential?
I came in the front.
Barry Egan.
Nothing.
Nothing.
I can keep the beat.
But, buddy --
I'm not upset.
Really?
...say, the hula hoop such a success.
The Eel doesn't get her. I'm explaining to you because you looked nervous.
Hey, you know, what can I say, I dig those cute little sweaters she wears.
I'll bet you do, you little horndog, she's givin' you fuckin' stiffies, right?
Alright, cool. I gotta hit the showers, but...I think this'll be really good.
So does your tongue cramp up?
Nah, you get kind of dizzy though.
Thousands of people did die, just different people.
Settle what?
God damn it, you fucking virgin prick--step outside.
C'mon, we got nothin' to fight about.
C ' mon!
I don't wanta fight you, I wanta thank you. Let's have a drink and forget this--
You fuck!
Why am I a fuck?
I didn t mean to imply you did, Mrs Spitz.
Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance!
Actually, she said you had decided. Decided not not come forward.
But even after you had an attorney. You still claimed to know nothing. Claimed not to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
No, sweetheart, it's a stag party. Does stay home.
I've missed you guys.
Don't worry... it's supposed to do this.
Not as much fun as the bachelor party the guys are throwing for me.
Of course. I'm a traditional guy... It's a traditional event. Well, what do you think?
It would be different, if we could just give it another go around.
Yes, but looks are deceiving... Not in this case, however.
That'd be good, Lula.
Yeah.
I want to come back.
That's not the point. I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?
WHAT?
Has Drag City Records, I know, I know. You told Dan Koretzky about this?
You had no right. Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?
And the "triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?" "Triumphant?" "Return?"
-- It's Malone's.
So Dorsey can get the girl?
Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
Thanks.
Is that your real name? Really?
We are at least six men short, and those we have will be overparted, ranters and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews. My Romeo has let me down. I see disaster.
Check with your son s bank. Banks don t usually give out information about their customers.
Well if there was an article about it I'm sure she did. She was always reading.
Problems?
Is my money in there?
So there's nothing between you and Susan?
I didn't know her. The body I took knew her. The man she met in the coffee shop this morning. I - uh - took him.
That was 'Joe'.
...I'm sorry, I'm a little discon- certed, that stuff between you and Susan -- uh -- threw me.
Very.
After all, this is a conservative firm -- I don't want people to think I'm an entertainer --
What makes a man like Ringo, Doc? What makes him do the things he does?
You're not okay.
Uh, uh. You lie down and you'll go to sleep
Cameron, I'm a little busy
Indeed, Miss Dorothy, I intend to have his blood as sure as my name's Roderick.
But we made a business deal.
Hey! When I was your age, there was only one girl who talked like that in the whole neighborhood.
Your girl friend's name is Ralph?
Capitalistic methods...
They accumulate millions by taking loss after loss.
What did he say?
What does he say?
Darling, calm down. Why do you need a lawyer? Haven't you your little Volga boatman?
Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
Smells fermented. Check in with the Institute, Reno, see if everything's kosher.
Same one you had yesterday?
That'll be all -- be here tomorrow at nine o'clock.
About a month ago. Six weeks.
Definitely off.
My daughters -- yes, my daughters.
What is it? Here!
Where'd you get this?
All right, boys. Take her along. I got ways of making her talk.
Hey, what more could I want? I survived my first and last hallucinogenic hellride, and neither of us is dead. I'd say I feel almost as great as you look.
I was an Indian, actually. Man, that damn psycho paint...! If that's supposed to be mild, I don't want to know about medium. The planet earth. It's good to be back.
Um... sort of... Maybe... It's all kind of blurry. We met at the club, then... Damn, that was some weird shit.
Well, listen. I'm going to swap you my Cadillac.
Why not?
I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
No.
What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
Pontificated.
I'm not afraid. I toured for a year with the National Puppet Company's production of "Long Day's Journey Into Night."
Sounds boring. Are there any songs?
Never heard of it.
What's the play?
How do we do that?
Dude, it's not like I haven't been trying to get laid.
Will you marry me?
Uh, yes, sir. The Monroe Hotel...
Well, no younger than I was.
Yes.
Jeanne... what are you doing?
Have a drink.
Here's the breakdown of figures on personnel turnover. Thirty-seven percent of our female employees leave to get married, twenty-two percent quit because --
No thanks.
Why are you doing this?
Yes, sir.
Hi. How you doin'?
What did he say?
Left you?
That's a Turkish weave, you numbskull; it costs more than you'll earn in your lifetime --
No. Mostly me.
I didn't think you'd come today.
Wyatt...
That thunder's sure somethin'.
Virgil?
That didn't sound like thunder.
Getting late. Guess I'll turn in.
Yes.
Yes.....we do ask for....30 to 60 days....
We back our plungers 100 and we do ask for a 30 to 60 day display on the floor.....
You're my daughter. I won't have you acting like a tramp!
Who is this man? You're engaged!
How are things going, pal?
I'll think about Wednesday.
Claire...
Oh yeah. When is it? This thing in Queens.
Yoooooow.
Where are you going?
Oh shit. I remember this. Want to go?
Keeping my body fit, keeping my mind alert, keeping my landlord appeased. That's a full-time job.
For mankind not a thing -- for womankind the record is not quite so bleak.
Not too big and not too small. What I'd call the typical room of an average man. Or shall we say a little above average. Now if there are any special aspects you wish to study I have nothing to conceal. Just look around. That's my desk. Those are my books, and here am I. Where shall we begin?
That's great. I'm thirty-five years old. Just over six feet tall. I weigh a hundred and eighty-two pounds stripped.
Thank you. Thank you.
Now don't get me mad! Even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. If I were ever caught in there, I'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!
What's the matter? Does he have a courtesy card from the police department?
I can't do that.
Well then do a good job of it! Get over there, and search Thorwald's apartment! It must be knee-deep in evidence.
I can't do it even if he's gone.
I mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. What he doesn't know won't hurt him.
I hate to remind you -- but this all started because you said she was murdered. Now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?
Well -- what good is his information?!! It's a second-hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself -- Thorwald! Anybody actually see the wife get on the train?
If possible -- both.
Doyle -- are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?
Looking for Crash Davis.
Jim looking for somebody.
He goes to a whorehouse every night?
I'm Nuke LaLoosh. With the Bulls.
They won't get a conviction. The husband called it in as a suicide. The forensic guys weren't thinking murder. I'm sure some of the evidence was compromised.
I already made my move, Kenneth.
It's your move, Miles.
If I'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can I do this?
What have you done to me?
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you?
That's got nothing to do with it!
That's a lie! Listen don't believe what he says . . .
That's a lie!
In love? Twenty-four hours with some wine-pourer chick and you think you're in love? And give up everything?
Like I might be in love with another woman.
Understanding of what?
I was hoping to get some understanding from you. And I'm not getting it.
Twenty-eight years, Frank.
Deep.
Being with Stephanie has opened my eyes. She's not uptight or controlling. She's just cool. Things are so easy with her. Smells different. Tastes different. Fucks different. Fucks like an animal. I'm telling you, I went deep last night, Miles. Deep.
Lotta water.
That's a lot of water under the bridge, eh, Jack?
Look who's talking. You've been there.
That's life. What can I tell you?
Life, gentlemen, is wonderful, but very dangerous. You must have courage for it, then it's wonderful. You gentlemen don't know that because you are all healthy and happy, but I -- believe me -- a man must know death and not until then does a man know anything about life.
I oughtn't to presume, but I -- I'm so grateful to you -- it's been so marvelous. The first time in my life I have gambled -- I've danced! Oh, you can laugh, gentlemen, but it's the first time in my life I've ever tasted life!
Yes.
Right.
Is he all right?
What is that he's working on?
What brown hands you have.
What?
You...
You...
Skiing?
Perfect, but I can't use it right now, I've got to get these locks done; it's a matter of priorities.
Yes, but it suddenly clicked, this is going to be a crazy place and, since the Commies are used to seeking asylum, we can use that in the marketing.
None, it's mine - you said it earlier, I'm nuts.
No....The Asylum!
Nope, not even close. I've thought of a name for this place and you were the inspiration though.
Good marrow, father!
How'd you meet Marsh?
By the hour of nine.
Sure. Where to?
These Pecks make terrible nurse- maids.
Nursemaid?!
I think Tom Grunemann's dead. I've been a lot of places - I've asked a lot of people. I've found no proof he's around. I've found no proof he was ever around.
Faith, I think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.
Hey! Give me that baby!
I'm leaving tonight. I'm going to need my clothes. And my gun.
Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised!
The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
Is that him over there?
Ah. Where?
Where are you meeting this person?
Look up, sunshine
He had no choice. You're a formidable adversary.
You... are a wuss. Part wimp. Part pussy.
They're not home yet.
Oh. That.
What do you think you're doing?
Huh?
I say we don't want to appear greedy.
Of course, we don't want to appear greedy, Mr. Deeds.
Tails tonight, sir?
What - tails? Why, that's a monkey suit! Do you want people to laugh at me? I never wore one of those things in my life.
How d you do this year, Tony?
Sorry, Jack. I told Dee and the kids I'd be home by dinner. You know, it being Christmas Eve and all.
I love you too sweetie, bye.
One more round.
Yeah, what a woman.
You wouldn't happen to know what language they speak in India, do you?
Claire?
Nope... never finished one yet. I hate these things.
Start acting like you're worthy of this mission... Here. Whatever you do, don't dare drop it.
Yes. The man made a business decision.
What if I want to talk about her, pard? What then? You know, that's all I've ever heard from you, since I was a kid... you never want to talk about that, man, and it's important.
Cover the ribs -- Look here, elbow down, tight -- Tight -- stand straight -- you're the best, you're the best!
Better watch out for that kind, Zackie. You know what they call 'em, don't ya?
Hejira? What kinda name is that?
Great ass.
So this break... is a break-up.
There's nothing to talk about. Two goddamn times I made it with your old lady. We barely even talked.
That's not how she told it. She said you wrote her every week you were away.
Sorry to lose you, Baxter.
Me? Oh, you mean my body. Don't worry, Doc -- it'll go to the University -- I'll put it in writing --
Can you use a bottle of champagne?
Booze we don't need. Why don't you join us, Baxter? We got two brain surgeons, an ear, nose and throat specialist, a proctologist, and three nurses from Bellevue.
What's this -- you packing?
Yeah -- I'm giving up the apartment.
Where are you moving to?
I don't know. All I know is I got to get out of this place.
No, thanks -- I don't feel like it. Look, Doc -- in case I don't see you again -- how much do I owe you for taking care of that girl?
Forget it -- I didn't do it as a doctor -- I did it as a neighbor. By the way, whatever happened to her?
Not all men hit. And no one is going to hit you anymore.
I got tired of hating my father.
It was a business decision.
You're packing.
It felt good.
Thanks, darlin', I know you got my best interest in mind, and I 'preciate it sincerely. I love you, but I gotta sleep now.
What?
Lula, I got to get some sleep.
Lula, he mighta did, I don't know. But it don't matter now. Lotta guys go outta control in a war and it ain't their fault.
No. All you need is to want to be the best.
You're the best, Enzo!
Because I'm sure you're dying to beat me.
I don't want to be in any competition... I dive because I like to, not to beat a record... don't you have to be very mad at somebody to want to beat him?
Why?
C'mon, just answer the question. You can say what you like. What the hell?
Huh?
Hey.
What the fuck is that?
No...
Like Japanese food.
Wyatt, my God! You're shot to pieces!
I'm telling you, there isn't a Mark on him.
I'm a man without fear, Wyatt. I Literally don't care if I live or Die. But even I can't fight human Instinct. Somebody suddenly Starts shooting at me, I duck. But you... what on earth were You thinking about?
Not all that pasta.
Yeah, I'll be fine. Bye.
Oh, come on.
No -- it just doesn't look right.
Freak, schmeek. Most of us are freaks in one way or another. Try being born a male Russian countess into a white middle class Baptist family in Mississippi and you'll see what I mean.
To my own special Sissy. Cheers! And welcome. So my letter brought ya flying, eh? Where were you? Salt Lake City? La Conner? Well, I may have a little surprise for you. But first, tell me about yourself. It's been six months, hasn't it? In some circles that's half a year. How are you?
That's the very first time in the eons that I've known you that I've ever heard you complain. And now you're tired, poor darling.
Who knows the Bosphorus Hug?
Miss Lonely Hearts. At least that's something you'll never have to worry about.
How can you tell that -- from here?
Um, okay. I'll call my study partner.
Sure. We'll go next weekend and --
Not for lack of love, I can tell ya that.
Let's discuss it when I'm unbound.
Well, they're all excellent reasons.
Don't count too much on my friendship, Ricky. In this matter I'm powerless. Besides, I might lose ten thousand francs.
Stop tearing me apart! You say one thing and he says another and then everybody changes back--
But you haven't any actual proof, and you know it. This isn't Germany or occupied France. All you can do is fine him a few thousand francs and give him thirty days. You might as well let him go now.
Excuse us a minute?
Someone should put poison in her epsom salts.
Sure. Sure.
You do.
You're not very subtle, but you are effective. I, I get the point. Yes, I have the letters, but I intend using them myself. I'm leaving Casablanca on tonight's plane, the last plane.
Huh?
Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend. Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
I hate your kids, Frank.
You mind telling me what that was about in there? Was that planned? Or were you just bored and decided to get creative?
Fuck him.
This isn't the Pine Tree Inn on Route 81, Jack.
Fuck him.
Fuck him. Great. Terrific. Fuck him.
So we on tomorrow night?
Maybe Thursday. I hear the harpist at the Sheraton's got appendicitis.
All right, Mickey.
Yes.
You just ripped my card in two!
That's the name they gave me.
Mr. Spicoli?
Are you this hard on everyone who tries to help you?
I just fnished work. I counted the bags.
Right.
It's a living.
If anyone gets in our way -- we have small nuclear devices.
Oh God no.
So not over her, in fact.
I believe I have.
Don't give a damn about the famous girl.
No, don't think I do.
Which means you won't be distracted by the fact that she's back in London, grasping her Oscar, and to be found filming most days on Hampstead Heath.
There's an understatement. There are dead people on better form.
But I wish to make it clear I've turned a corner and henceforward intend to be impressively happy.
So -- you've laid the ghost.
I believe you would have. Another fall, I did seven years at Lompoc. And I don't mean the place next door where some of Nixon's people went.
He's genuinely upsetting, isn't he?
Won't worry about it. You go ahead.
No touch. No touch. No touch.
Well, I work all the time. So never, never again interrupt me. Okay? I mean, never. Not 30 years from now... not if there's fire. Not even if you hear a thud from inside my home and a week later there's a smell from in there that can only come from a decaying body and you have to hold a hanky against your face because the stench is so thick you think you're going to faint even then don't come knocking or, if it's election night and you're excited and want to celebrate because some fudge-packer you dated has been elected the first queer President of the United States... and he's going to put you up in Camp David and you just want to share the moment with someone... don't knock ... not on this door. Not for anything. Got me. Sweetheart?
Yes. It's not a subtle point you're making.
Okay, then.
You may think you can intimidate the whole world with your attitude, but I grew up in Hell. My grandmother had more attitude. You don't intimidate me.
Police! Police! Fucking crooked police... doughnut-munching morons help me! Assault and battery and you're black.
I... What do you want?
Am I too heavy for you?
I don't know why I'm so tired all of a sudden.
What?
Yes, thanks.
What comes after Z?
No they won't.
I can't --
I'm starting to... We may do the capitols of the states.
Fifty, right?
There are only ten.
You're feeling good, aren't you?
Okay.
Yes.
Don't name them. Just tell me if you know.
Yes, Aaron. I know the names of the Cabinet.
Okay, let's drop it. I didn't mean I'd take a test for you -- I mean if that came up in conversation I'd...
We're conversing...Oh my, the names of the entire Cabinet has slipped my mind. What are they?
What?
Let's go.
You don't?
Parry...
All right... shoot! I mean... what's on your mind?
Maybe you're my friend and maybe you're not -- but don't come any nearer. You can't trust anybody in this crazy world. Say, I'll bet I could shoot you from here.
What's his line?
You've seen the latest cartoon in Punch, I take it?
I was trying to imagine "rather upset."
Not at all, Dean. Good of you to spare the time.
Gimme the water! Ya gettin' tagged with his right. I think you should feint left and high hook 'im -- Benny, check the eyes! Can ya see?
You can do anything you want. You're his sister.
Uh huh, a boy, you've got a new brother.
He ain't losin' nothin'.
I'm just going to find things for the fire.
The insurance business?
Not bad. I didn't expect you to make it out.
Up to you. You could tell him the check is in the mail.
Oh, I'm awful tired. I couldn't go through another day like this.
It's not yogurt -- it's mayonnaise.
Go ahead--you didn't used to be so fussy--
We was just leavin', fellows.
We could go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
I'm relieved at 4:00 A.M.
You might be the only one with a job.
She seems confused, irresponsible, overemotional. My wife says that's the way girls act sometimes.
A horse?
Fine, thanks. Come on in. I want to talk to you.
Hello, sir. How are things at the hat store?
Hello, Charlie.
I understand. Thank you.
Yes, sir. But that's what I like about her. She's not like all the other girls at school.
Attractive. Bright. Distant. Charming when she wants to be.
I don't understand.
What do you mean?
Yes?
Yeah. He's a smashing bloke.
Please, there's no... Oh.
Then okay. So how old were you when you met him?
You don't have to say anything
Hmmm.
Hi.
Adorable. What time are they supposed to be here?
We have to make it an early night.
Hmmm.
These chaps'll need a woodpecker to pick their teeth.
Come on, Gump, let's have a look at this witchcraft.
Where?
If ever I meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. I'll fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.
Take this to Baines. Tell him if he ever tries to see her again I'll take off another and another and another!
Yes. Yes. Let me out!
I live on tips, so don't be offended, but you're a liar. I saw you kiss. Admit it, this is the street where love lives.
I'm begging.
Because I need your help, sweet thing. And I need it bad.
Don't take that foot off the hammer, 'cause you got wall-to-wall Bears about to pour over you like maple syrup.
What do you want me to do, Hot Pants? Beg?
Hot Pants, please. I'm gonna be flying by in about five minutes with Smokey on my tail. Can you lock it off behind me?
I know how to gamble now.
That's wonderful, Mom.
Lisa -- I -- I -- can't tell you how scared I was that you -- you might --
Think you've got enough for a search warrant now?
To get you back at work so you can wait on me.
Carol the waitress?
I hate Miss Clancy, you know I do! And I only danced with her because -- because -- the person with whom I intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.
I've felt that way, yeah.
Yep.
So...Wanta make love?
You 'want to know', I'll tell you. You're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, he's galloping into it. And the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. And, oh yes, I almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with Death.
I was just asking, Bill.
'Magic Fingers.' Fifty cents.
All in all, what Bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to Drew with no hard feelings.
Quince, I've got confidence in you.
Two years.
Thanks.
Sir, I'll deliver the package.
What the hell do you care?
Not at all.
We can cut back at the end.
Did you shoot their boots?
Don't give up. You're going to make it.
Thanks.
It was my dog. Let me ask you a question. How long have you been acquainted with Jerry?
You were going to ask about my nose. The poor animal is slated to be destroyed today.
A dog bit it.
Just write another one. You have lots of ideas, right?
What's that supposed to mean?
No, I'm finished. I'm not a writer. I'm a middle-school English teacher. I'm going to spend the rest of my life grading essays and reading the works of others. It's okay. I like books. The world doesn't give a shit what I have to say. I'm unnecessary. I'm so insignificant, I can't even kill myself.
What about that guy who wrote Confederacy of Dunces? He committed suicide before he got published, and look how famous he is.
You know -- Hemingway, Sexton, Woolf, Plath, Delmore Schwartz. You can't kill yourself before you've even been published.
In His name??
Thank you very much. But, Cliff, that's my seat. And I was just--
It might.
You take it. I don't know.
'...But Sid, let me urge you to work closely with the new president, and to keep giving Hudsucker Industries all your energies -- but not your soul. For while we must strive for success, we must not worship it. Long live the Hud. Waring Hudsucker...'
Oh, it's a fire hydrant.
Oh ... That's strange. Maybe--are you sure this is your bag?
'...And so, Sid, the future does not belong to such as I -- nor even you. We have made our compromises with time. The future belongs to the young, who may more energetically wage the battle against corruption. Accordingly, in the spirit of hope, and the ringing in of the new, I hereby bequeath my entire interest in the company, and my seat on the board, to whomever is Hudsucker's most recent employee at the time of my demise. I know this will disappoint you -- you, Sid, who have served so diligently and for so long. But --'
Don't worry. You won't even see her.
First Lady...
You're kidding?
They barely talk anymore.
Holy cow.
It happens. This is where you'll be sleeping.
Oh... Okay.
We'll be back for you first thing tomorrow and if you need me for anything, Duane will be right outside the door.
Not a dent. Perfect
I got a pretty good guess.
Okay. Here's a new one. It's called Tenderness. I couldn't sleep so I thought I'd scream Betrayed by a kiss, sucking pods of bitterness. In the madhouse of Dr. Dread Razor shreds of rat puke fall On my bare arms I'm sorry. I guess I was trying to impress you.
I've got some very, very good news for you, my friend.
Don't be silly. Nothing you can do. Must be tough on an old woman a trip like this.
I think your life's about to change.
So you found Mary?
Right there in Liberty City. And you were right, she's really something.
So she hasn't changed?
What are you eating.
-- what's the problem, honey?
And in that niche, there is a statue of Venus.
-- listen, I wonder if you kids could give me a ride? I'm kind of stranded here.
Terrific. Now all I have to do is find my car keys.
Everything okay, son?
If my universe had a hub...
We took several photographs, there's no need.
What's this?
Certainly not.
Try to get a second radiator, we'll bury it between here and the Pottery Hill. And a better jack. We planned badly.
Bermann!
I know that, Lois. And I wish he were here . . .
Sure. I can follow that.
You? You're Madame Flocquet? I pictured a fat lady with an apron, not - I don't know - La Femme Nikita.
Yeah, that's the word. And you are?
Yeah. True. The cops weren't much help either. Their theory is he was moonlighting as a drug dealer or something. Make sense to you?
So we got this guy scared shitless and he starts talkin'. And, Krinkle, you ain't gonna fuckin' believe it.
Nicholson and I.
Anya!
You like that statue?
Listen--can't you wait till we get home?
Walters had nothing to do with your father's murder.
You're sure? It's cold.
It's okay.
Probably see you at the book store.
Hi. I could give you a ride if you need.
Where do you live?
You'd rather think about it and make yourself miserable?
Um-hum ...
Just a second.
Uh huh?
Yeah.
I mean, do you realize what you've... well, of course you realize, that's why you're confessing, I mean... I mean... how could you do that?
Yeah?
-- You're like a little squirrel of music, storing away dead little nuts of old garbage music, musical lint, old shit, shit, shit --
-- Barry, if I were to say to you I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet, what would that mean?
Just... come on, what would it mean to you? That sentence? "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet?"
To me, it would mean that you're a liar. You saw it twice. Once with Laura -- oops -- once with me and Dick. We had that conversation about the possibilities of the guy making ammo off-screen in the Fourteenth Century.
Yeah, yeah, I know. But say I hadn't seen it and I said to you, "I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," what would you think?
I'd think you were a cinematic idiot. And I'd feel sorry for you.
No, but would you think, from that one sentence. That I was going to see it?
I'm sorry, Rob, but I'm struggling here. I don't understand any part of this conversation. You're asking me what I would think if you told me that you hadn't seen a film that you've seen. What am I supposed to say?
Just listen to me. If I said to you --
"-- I haven't seen Evil Dead II yet," yeah, yeah, I hear you --
Coming from you, that's quite a compliment.
Death, I'm trying to make things right. Take my soul. Turn me into a paper doll. But give me just one lousy hour.
I have a girl up there. And I never - I should've - I just want to tell her I love her.
I'm not going to tell you that. I wanted that E- ticket. I wanted it so bad I'd stare you right in the face to get it - and I'd do the same again.
Victoria...I love you.
Okay.
Tsch, I know. A relationship, I think, is-is like a shark, you know? It has to constantly move forward or it dies. And I think what we got on our hands is a dead shark.
Whose "Catcher in the Rye" is this?
Oh, it sure has... You know, you wrote your name in all my books, 'cause you knew this day was gonna come.
There's no-no question in my mind. I think we're doing the mature thing, without any doubt.
Are you going to listen?
-- And now you're going to pee some more.
Joe, don't do this --
The Board didn't know you're a mole who burrowed inside so you could bury us all.
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy? Another one of his whoppers? Aren't you sick of this asshole lurking around? No one knows who he is, but one thing everyone does know, he somehow got your ear and has been pouring poison into it ever since.
Who?
Oh, you mean use him...That's nice. Okay.
We do both. Our frontal attack a diversion whilst we drive a tunnel under...
Bye-bye, Elena. ...What an idiot! What an idiot! 'Nice day'! Christ!!
No particular reason... Nice day, huh?
No -- Don't worry about it. Let's do this.
In other times, for other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. He...
So, do you want to be -- I mean, how do you want to do it?
And for all that dough I don't do nothin'?
Absolutely nothing. You do nothing and you say nothing. You understand, don't you, kid?
Sure, that's all right when you're a kid, but you'll be pushing thirty pretty soon, slugger. It's time you got some ambition.
I always figured I'd live longer without it.
They feel you've been sort of left out of things, Terry. They think it's time you had a few little things going for you on the docks.
Ten cents a hundred pounds on everything that moves in and out. And you don't have to lift a finger. It'll be three-four hundred a week just for openers.
Maybe.
Yeah, right here.
Hey, why don't you just keep your room and we'll put the baby in the back yard.
You better not leave that Cadillac sitting out here.
Hi!
I was wondering if you might help me. I...I seem to have lost my Congressional Medal of Honor somewhere around here.
She knows how to take care of herself.
You like it?
Thank-Q!
I'm Adam Webber.
Could ya take off that hat.
Would ya take off your glasses?
But I'm willin' to make the best of this uncomfortable situation.
The glasses... Please.
Greg, is that you under the covers?
Ahh, strike, not, not bad at all. No, this talk isn't about sex, it's, well there've been a lot of changes, and I know you're upset about losing your room, but the baby's gotta go somewhere.
Anybody would have done it.
I ain't never met anyone come close to you, sugar.
No--no.
You got a better idea?
That money's not ours, Adam -- if we keep it, we'll be breaking the law.
You're right. I remember Grandpierre looking through it. But there was nothing in it -- at least, nothing that the police thought was very important.
Can you remember anything at all?
He's insane or drunk or something. Why, if this unfortunate man, Williams, has really been reprieved, I personally am tickled to death. Aren't you, Pete?
Out of the mouths of babes.
I think it only said where -- but I can't --
Think, Reggie, you've got to think -- it may be what we're looking for.
Grandpierre asked me about an appointment Charles had -- on the day he was killed.
With whom? Where?
I'm breaking no promises!
You ought to put up a banner-- "Frontera, Texas: Gateway to Cut- Rate Pussy"--
Seems like we have another one every week.
Of course, everything's not as harmonious as it seems. I hope you've a strong constitution.
Yeah, me too.
How you doing?
Twenty-five percent.
You're not getting any navy contracts.
I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
A surprise?
What say we get outta here and go crush a bucket?
Fine. Fine.
The museum? I thought we were going out to dinner?
For this class?
I will.
That's what I'd do if I could. Nothing wrong with that. Hey Ben, Elaine's coming down from Berkeley soon. I want you to call her up this time.
You got me.
Would you mind telling me then -- what were those four years of college for? What was the point of all that hard work?
No.
Have you thought about graduate school?
Oh -- not too much. Taking it easy.
Hi, Ben. What are you doing with yourself these days?
Now listen, Ben. I think it's a very good thing that a young man -- after he's done some very good work -- should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself, and lie around, and drink beer and so on. But after a few weeks I believe that person would want to take some stock in himself and his situation and start to think about getting off his ass.
What do you mean?
They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it.
It's so damn quiet out there.
Take wing!
What it was, probably...
Gee.
You hate your father.
I didn't ask for the money, Phil just gave it to me.
Man to man, Mr. Charles, are you working on this case?
But you came. And you must forget everything-- except that you are here, Countess.
Mind if I join you?
With your skin, I prefer crimson.
The ice cream or Mel Gibson's bottom?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that. I have quite a bit of influence in Personnel. You know Mr. Sheldrake?
He and I are like this. Sent me a Christmas card. See?
Well, as long as you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with me -- how about the three of us going out this evening -- you and me and the bowler -- stroll down Fifth Avenue -- sort of break it in --
I understand. Christmas -- family and all that --
You saw that?
I thought maybe I could put in a word for you with Mr. Sheldrake -- get you a little promotion -- how would you like to be an elevator starter?
We will. Something's wrong here. She's helping him now.
No it's not. Guys name their penises.
Relax, Monty. It's just my sister.
I thought people just wanted their mail delivered on time.
I think maybe people are scared off by the tiki torches.
Well...uh...
Uh...yeah...sorry.
Strip?
You mean like, strip strip?
No idea.
You're really doing a great job here, Josie. I like your "can do" attitude.
yet cannot love nor write it.
Will it restore my gift?
To the Palace at Whitehall.
Did you get a doctor?
Annie---
It's starting to grow on me. But what do the 'B' and 'P' mean?
Well, when you wonder, ask me.
Why do you love me?
I was thinking I hope he doesn't get injured. I felt responsible.
What happened?
Yeah, I've heard them a million times, too, but there you are. Maybe they're like me. Just beginning to get an idea what those things mean.
Pleased to meet ya, Jack. I read your book. I'm impressed. Good work on Curtis Fox.
... You have a little... uh... something on your face...
I'm not going to hurt you, absolutely, I'm not.
No, you're frightened, you're pretending. Well -- Klute knows about me then. Does everybody know, can you tell me?
Then it doesn't matter what I do any more, does it?
You have no idea what I'm talking about.
It's public record. If the public cares enough to read it.
No.
What's wrong? What happened to Gibarian?
Well that's kind of a bad situation then, isn't it?
Maybe there's hope for you yet.
Yes, sir!
Hey, you guys still awake?
Hey, Sid, thanks.
I looked it up.
Yeah.
The next few weeks I would like to know where you are all the time.
We got engaged.
What would you say?
I'd show him my hearse. And my room, and stuff.
What kind of stuff?
Thanks, but I've got to be going. Unfortunately, Doc, this isn't a social visit.
Susan?
Did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?
A smaller bowl of flowers.
Those flowers are too high. Won't be able to see her. Get a smaller bowl, will you?
I have a certain function to per- form, and that seems to take all of my time. Bu sometimes - uh - I speculate - uh - I haven't left room for - uh - anything else.
Yes, sir.
Fourteen carat?
Oh, yes sir.
Is that the best you've got?
Yes, quite all right. Thank you, sir.
How's it going? Okay?
Yes, sir.
Gold, eh?
I was the more deceived.
What did you say that for, Sarah?
Eleven o'clock... I'll be back later.
Give me a drag.
You told me.
No. It's all arranged.
Oh, never mind about that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will you?
Good. I've got the letters right here, all made out in blank.
Hey -- it's all for the higher good right?
Oh, save it. We've still lots of things to do.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Who else can give me information about you?
What? We took bathes together when we were kids.
You and Verona?
And you! Start pounding that typewriter. Oh, boy! This is terrific! No responsibilities on our part. Just statements from John Doe and we can blast our heads off.
Uh, yeah. We're old friend
I hear you're helpin' Verona.
There's a bathroom upstairs.
The water tastes better in the kitchen.
What are you doing up?
Don't ever do that again.
I thought I saw a black widow spider.
Miss Scarlett. In the broom closet. With the radio.
Does it matter?
Maybe.
I'm Martin Blank.
Wonderful.
Whatever I can get away with.
I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
No, sir.
I guess I did.
I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
Morning, gentlemen. Everything satisfactory? You like your office?
You threatening me?
Listen, Baxter, we made you and we can break you.
So long, Baxter. We know you won't let us down.
Oh, yes, sir. Very much. And I want to thank you --
Don't thank me -- thank your friends here -- they're the ones who recommended you.
So long, fellas. Drop in any time. The door is always open -- to my office.
I like the way you handled that. Well, how does it feel to be an executive?
Yes, but there's just something About him. Something around The eyes, I don't know, reminds me Of... me. No. I'm sure of it, I Hate him.
No -- in my room.
In Mr. Dyle's room?
I was, too.
Yeah. Apparently.
Hope I didn't hurt him too bad.
Up to there? Really? I bet I could beat that.
Don't need to go heeled to get The bulge on a dub like you.
Will you try to get some sleep?
I know I know, but you just go to sleep, and then you can dream about it, and it'll be a whole garden.
Uh-huh.
I live in an abandoned fox den neath the roots of a thousand-year-old oak. My bed is pine boughs and rabbit skins. There's no need of weaponry to keep the maids away.
Stop.
What's wrong.
Yes. Yes.
Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams'd shoot out of your fingers and your toes, and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much?
What is it you want, Mary? What do you want? You want the moon? Just say . . .
Uh-uh. What Cobra?
Stop equivocating! Unbelievable, how you equivocate! You, the atheist, you're more dogmatic than any holy person I've ever seen! This is happening, Kelvin. Wake up.
I beg you, Doctor, don't make me say it.
Perhaps you'll be so kind as to remind me of her name...
HER NAME, ABBE.
And take the twenty thousand francs ...
He was so impressed with the Marquis' tale that he chose to re-enact it, yes?
As you say, Doctor.
Because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. Do we look like the kind of store that sells "I Just Called To Say I Loved You?" Go to the mall and stop wasting our time.
Do you even know your daughter? There is no way she likes that song. Or is she in a coma?
Oh yeah. We got it.
No, you can't.
Maybe he's scared of the dark.
Josie, you're different. When you speak in class, I can tell--You actually feel the words-- in here. They're alive. Like-Eurdora Welty talked about the word it moon"? How for her it was like a Concord grape. "That Grandpa took off his vine and gave to me to suck out of its skin--"
Should we explore?
Want to read any books? Take your pick! Isn't this the craziest?
What?
Hi.
Why?
You cannot marry Wessex!
Fifth of scotch?
All right, what's it to be? New Mexico's that way.
So're the Cowboys. They're up That road right now, waiting to Jump us.
Your wig. Remove your wig.
Holly!
Reggie -- please believe me!
No!
Are you happy?
Eve and I...eloped. We're married.
Yes.
No, Mom, I've turned it into Dad's office.
No thanks, Carl.
-- He's just a lucky guy.
... as ... you ... wish...
Faithfulness he talked of, madam. Your enduring faithfulness. Now, tell me truly. When you found out he was gone, did you get engaged to your prince that same hour, or did you wait a whole week out of respect for the dead?
Can you move at all?
Eeeeuuuww, gross.
And you? It must've been an ordeal.
Christ, I know Snoopy Miller. He's a fuckin' wackjob thinks he's Sugar Ray Leonard. Hangs out with a couple other Grade-A nutcases over on the West side.
We're finished.
This is where the auditions were.
I just don't understand. You would think someone ... anyone ...
It was a somewhat extraordinary day.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on a second there, baby. Why do you need one of the new Buicks?
A right fair mark, fair cuz, is soonest hit.
Yeah.
Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
The Fairy Queen? And the baby here's a princess? And these two rodents are your guides?
Yes it does. The Fairy Queen told me.
French people need a visa to enter this country. That takes time and I didn t have any. I used a British passport. My name s not Lamont but Lombard. Xavier Lombard.
Well, he's spitting on my neck! You know, he's spitting on my neck when he talks.
Hey, you... everybody in line at the New Yorker has to know our rate of intercourse?
If I could trouble the Baron to come and see this beautiful room. I have ordered champagne. Perhaps the Baroness could join us.
We'll dance.
Waiter, oh waiter! Wait a minute! We are having caviar -- it's expensive but that makes no difference -- I see the Baroness is laughing.
I'd like to hit this guy on a gut level.
Madmartigan! You saved her life!
Teach me how I should forget to think.
Man -- that's terrible. He was a nice fellow -- I am sorry about him.
It seems that he was a thief and an imposter.
Man -- I was at the clinic the whole night -- there are no words to describe what my wife suffered.
And the child isn't coming?
No -- no -- not yet. Well, I mustn't let it interfere with my duty. Any news here?
News? Yes -- killing in number one- sixty-four.
What? -- Who? -- Whom?
The big manufacturer killed Baron von Gaigern.
Good heavens. What for?
Correct. Now the train leaves--
Rio. BUNNY Right. This kid, Hosea Brown? Does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement--the whole package. Only a sophomore--
That's in Maverick County.
No--not yet--but-- Two tickets to Berlin--first class and sleeper--night train ... Right ... Right ... Leave them in the name of--Don Ignacio Fernandez ... Right ... Thank you.
You're dismissed, Private.
You still going to all the home games?
The windows don't open.
If...if not, I'll have the tape...I'll wait for you at my apartment.
Thanks, Jane. Have a good time tonight.
Listen to yourself, Wyatt. Lie Down and crawl or you might get Hurt? What kinda talk is that? That's Virgil lyin' over there, Wyatt. Our own brother. Ruined For life. No sir, I ain't going No place. You want to go, fine. I'm stayin' right here and have It out with those bastards.
I'm putting it on the top step.
I'm putting it here by the door.
I'd rather not.
Right.
You were chillin', kind of creepy even. You totally fucked with his head. I'm gonna go grab dinner.
Yes, but --
Annie's a smart lady.
There are things I have to tell you, about how we met, and why we are together. But they can wait. The only important thing now is that I love you and I'm going to keep you safe.
Just wander.
I said goodbye to you. I was locked out of the flat. I climbed the wall and came in through the bathroom window. I started to read and then I was naked at the zoo! I guess I am out of my fucking mind.
Waking up at the zoo, that's not so insane. Having no clothes on? That's insane. What did I do last night, Alex?
Did you get my letter, Mare? The one about Ted?
Uh-huh. I was worried about you.
That's what I want to tell ya. I've been through two years of extensive psychotherapy and you know what? You were right -- I needed help.
For the money, they re hands down the best radial we carry...
No, it's not serious. I'm just not supposed to get excited. You know-- no strain, no stress. I try to keep calm all the time.
They wouldn't take me. I'm Class IV-- I've got a heart defect.
Really! Is it serious?
Liberator...
Have you enlisted?
What kind of plane are you flying?
A B-24 Liberator.
Damnitt, Monica. This ain't about us anymore, it's about me.
Holy Shiite! What the fuck's this?
What about you? You're the one with the girlfriend and you're still stranded on third base.
Nadia does, that Czechoslovakian chick, she might be there tonight. Now, do you think she'd prefer -- Cool Hip Jim... or Laid Back Jim?
Who cares?
Shortstop. 'Course, you don't make it to third, and you're out.
Then where does a blowjob figure in?
Contact, dude.
You know, I've never got that shit. What exactly constitutes third base?
I think it's cool.
So let's say you get there...what's uh, third base feel like?
You'd rather have a mother that's a member of the police state? Rules are made to be broken. Just ask him.
Look, I quit!
Yeah?
Yeah.
How un-sixties of you.
I'll remember that the next time you get excited by drawing pubic hairs on raisin bran. Want some?
Hi.
Claire?
It's just me. I want to talk to you. Let me in...
Open the door, will you?
No, you'll be safe. We're gonna pick him up again...
There!
Just wanted to let you know You're sitting in my chair.
Well, I guess it's about that time.
I think so too.
I want to see a friend of mine... a very dear friend.... It's a personal matter which has nothing to do with politics or social philosophies.... It's a girl.
That does it, Swana. Now you mustn't miss your appointment with your hair-dresser.
Thank you, Swana. You are very gracious.
She must have her little joke. You're not going to take that seriously.
The Grand Duchess Swana... active in the White Russian movement?
Believe me, I have no connection with her any longer... I swear I haven't!
But you had!
Listen, I want to be absolutely frank with you. I have no business in Moscow.
You have a way with words.
Let's go. Eject.
1000.
I can't eject.
Time to go.
Go ahead. I can't reach. 2000 feet!
3000 feet. I'll do it.
All right.
How do you feel?
I am, Gaston.
It's a pleasure to meet you, Faith.
He wants to improve himself... and you will be able to play on it ... Teach him to look after it.
Life is unpredictable.
You heard right.
I think Santos or Marietta Fortune.
Hopin' you could tell me if there's a contract out on me. I really need to know.
I didn't see nothin'...
I really wish I could understand why you think this is so necessary.
I don't need a crazy woman in my life.
Well, I got Annie all warmed up for ya... She's just waiting for you to show up, y'know...
Here. Got pictures.
I... uh guess congratulations are in order.
Muh -- Well, uh -- Huh?
Nuke-- Good luck.
Yeah, thanks for everything.
War is not all black.
Is that a fact? Well, that fits in right along with everything I've been saying. War is not all black.
Perfectly lovely. You know, this is what we're defending. Everything that's good and beautiful in the American way of life. Oh, there's some nut peace petitioner over there. Let's go off this way. Those crazy Commie bastards. I don't know why we tolerate 'em. Parasites.
During wartime the national suicide rate goes down.
Let's examine the facts on it. I say this country has been too harsh in its outright condemnation of war. I say you can point to many material advantages brought about by a crisis and conflict policy. Hell, World War II gave us the ballpoint pen. That's common knowledge.
Oh, tsch, thank you. H'm.
You really don't believe I'd take on a partner after all these years without a little...insurance?
Oh, no, no, don't be... tsch... don't be silly. You know, I'm startin' it-I'm startin' to get some feeling back in my jaw now.
Here is my gold. Worse poison to men's souls, than these poor compounds that thou mayest not sell.
Tempt not a desperate man!
Live and be prosperous; and farewell good fellow.
Almost everything's been done -- under panic. But this is a thousand to one shot. That man's still sitting around his apartment; he isn't panicked.
You think I made all this up?
It's too stupid and obvious a way to murder -- in full view of fifty windows -- and then sit over there -- -- smoking a cigar -- waiting for the police to pick him up.
Well, officer -- do your duty.
I'll admit it all has a mysterious sound -- but is could mean a number of different things. Murder is the least likely.
Go ahead, Doyle -- tell me he's an unemployed magician -- amusing the neighborhood with sleight-of-hand.
You didn't see the killing, or the body? How do you know there was a murder?
Because everything that man's done has been suspicious. Trips at night in the rain, saws, knives, trunks with rope, and a wife that isn't there any more.
They ready, Earl?
Where were you?
I'd appreciate it if you'd put that back.
Yeah... Threw my whole day off.
Thanks.
Brought it.
Your boyfriend?
They changed Franklin's portrait.
I can't promise you anything.
Top pocket... Go on.
...yes...
What do you think? Good move?
... can I just say 'no' to your kind request and leave it at that?
The truth is...
... with you, I'm in real danger. It took like a perfect situation, apart from that foul temper of yours -- but my relatively inexperienced heart would, I fear, not recover if I was once again ... cast aside, which I would absolutely expect to be. There are too many pictures of you everywhere, too many films. You'd go and I'd be... well, buggered, basically.
I live in Notting Hill. You live in Beverly Hills. Everyone in the world knows who you are. My mother has trouble remembering my name.
I'm sorry.
If I've done anything to make you think that what's happened between us is nothing new for me -- is some routine -- then I do apologize.
BECAUSE I CAN'T HAVE YOU!
I DON'T WANT TO NEED YOU!
What's the matter, Mr. Kringelein?
Oh, can anyone engage you for the evening?
They've been on to you all along. Knew you had a big job going.
Then you know him?
General Director Preysing! Baron, when I was sixteen years old, I started as an office boy in that man's factory --
I'm not asking you to set me up, Jay. That's not what I need your help for. I want to know what it's like over there.
You mean, like, "He has the cutest butt"? Where did I hear that recently?
Seventy... eight.
I don't think it could let a woman pay for dinner.
Well, what do you know wife.
Well, how do you do. Congratulations. Congratulations. What am I doing?
Because you're going to bed. I don't think I should be up here.
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.
Right.
I know that. But I'm --
Because I like you so much. You have coffee here every morning, don't you? If I came by, could you give me the name of a doctor?
Listen up, huh? Even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?
He thought you were a woman, Airk!
Oh...
Uhh, it's nice to meet ya. Uhh, we got burgers and hot dogs here if you'd care to join us?
Shelly?
Danny?
Okay, I know you've suffered a terrible loss, and there's really nothing anyone can do to comfort you, but I urge you to focus on the times you had with the camper, the trips you took, the sights you saw, those days are gone now, but they'll live on in your heart forever.
I didn't say it, she did. How'd you happen to get in that line of work?
All right, thanks. Now, let's see. How will I start? Hey pal, how would you start?
Do you really think you can beat him?
Hardly complimentary, Your Highness. Why loose your venom on me?
I left him hanging around the American Express.
When?
I don't mind her if you don't.
Plannin' on getting married?
Like to raise the stakes, Mr. Felson?
I think you'd better go.
Go?! Wait a minute - that's a great story! Newspaper reporter was forcibly ejected from Schuyler Mansion, and
What's the difference? You got a pool cue, balls on the table. All you gotta do is get the feel of it.
You don't want to hear about it.
Oh, some shit.
It was my fault, T.J. Fuck!
What about when she identifies him?!
God, I would love to think I'm an interesting teacher. I mean, I had maybe one or two teachers in high school who had any passion at all.
Had to let her go. I see you thinkin' there, superstar. Don't.
She's all right.
I'm not ready for marriage.
She expects me to marry her.
No.
Cush, Matt -- we have a decision to make.
People home.
Hmmmm... Well, the scampi sounds good...
Not what the records show. Anyway, she was a runaway, arrests for vandalism, petty theft, drugs, the whole bit. Parole records show she graduated from community college, moved into a retreat house, teaches some classes at the seminary school, hasn't been in any trouble since.
We can help you through this. Why don't you start now by telling me everything you can remember about your relationship with Clementine.
Well... I did.
Yeah.
Patrick, let's just get through this. We have a long night ahead of us.
Not a dump, then, but kind of plain. Uninspired. And there's a stale smell. Sort of stuffy. I don't know. Stuffy.
It's an apartment.
Good, good.
I am. You-you made my day.
Fabulous, I mean it! I'm so impressed.
I-I would love to talk to you about, uh, that script. I-I, you know, I think maybe that we could do something with it.
It was just great. Uh, I was all set...I was set to be bored stiff.
It's all right. She had a little too much to drink, that's all. Forget it. Go upstairs and sleep it off.
Oh, who cares?
I need the money to smooth my way, you understand? Now, have you got that sort of cash here or do we need to meet in the morning?
I will of course do my best to hang onto it.
Yeah, murder-suicide.
Absolutely. Ice cold still water.
Where you going?
Yes, she's, she's very warm, but, but it-it's me that wants to be giving to you. I-I-I want to do things for you. Hannah doesn't need me as much. I'm being presumptuous. Not that you need me.
You missed a very dull TV show about Auschwitz. More gruesome film clips...and more puzzled intellectuals declaring their mystification over the systematic murder of millions.
You sure got real conclusive ways of demonstrating that.
Nothing like no choice to make you feel at home.
What are you talking about? You got real problems.
I don't know. It wouldn't be very smart.
I know, but if we can't put in all these wonderful things at least let's put in some imagination. In that one omelet we'll taste the whole of Paris!
What are your turn-ons?
In the lake?
I recognize you.
What's your favorite movie star?
Would you like a bite of my pie?
Goodbye, Judy. Take it easy.
Your mother will be down in a few minutes.
She's being called for.
Besides my father, I mean.
Now, Mrs. Banderas. What is your relationship to Mrs. Rexroth.
Right, right. Ahm -- did you enjoy making the film?
What makes you think I would do that?
What makes you think I could do that?
He owned the colored roadhouse before Big O--
You were a cop.
Nobody ever loved me that much.
He always has.
Good.
Whose ratings were higher?
How 'bout Ted Bundy? Ever do one on him?
Yours.
They knew of you. Now they know you.
That's cool then.
It's just you and your dad, right?
Could someone have hurt you that bad?
-- we can't now.
-- you are.
Yes.
It's no joke. I'm responsible for what happens, you know. Embarrassment aside, there's a lot of money and effort in this, at least by my standards. I have to put down a deposit for the room. I have to pay the pressing plant for the records, sleeve them, sticker them --
I'm sorry I've been acting like a jerk. I do appreciate what you've done for me, and I know you've done it for the best possible reasons, and I do love you, even though I act like I don't.
No.
Yer crazy!--I ain't got no bracelet.
Laura...
No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
Look, we can do other things.
So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split. But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.
The prom? Kat has a date?
Pirate -- no question.
No
There are no windows facing my...exposure.
He escaped. He's going back in.
You didn't go telling your father you were here?
Perfect, Wyatt. Simply perfect.
No, forget it, it was stupid.
You better ace it...you sacrificed our whole vacation.
Figured it was something like that.
I was just telling the woman how I feel, for God's sake.
Maggie wanted to have a baby...and...umm...I didn't.
I'm not a Podiatrist, I'm a Cardiologist.
Okay, that does it, that does it, the strudel does it, first it's brakes then.... I mean I am not gonna let some Podiatrist with a Jaguar full of strudel come waltzing in here and....
Better unlock the door. Sit up, darling, and be dignified.
That's where you come in. Now, listen, Shortie--
Look, listen to me. A woman is dying - my wife! - is dying seventy miles from here. I have been walking for three days! I don't want to spell my name, I want you to give me this jeep!
No! NO! Don't radio anybody, just give me the fucking jeep!
He was big, an' very nasty so I destroyed him in a hurry -- Now I'm gettin' ready for Mac Lee Green next month.
Very high an' very fast.
The Bicentennial Heavyweight Championship of the World is gonna be held in the only place it can be held -- Philadelphia! -- the nation's cradle -- January First -- the first major event of our two hundredth year.
Yeah. I just wanted to congratulate you on your scholarship to England, and I wanted to tell you that I thought your speech was really incredible.
The cook.
Asshole!!
I feel better if I move.
I must meet my ship.
And this is William.
I'm sorry, I --
That's not good enough.
Who'll bring it to me?
You've got a man here and the kids are upstairs?
I've got my father coming through tomorrow anyway. I should get some sleep.
Everybody has one like that. I thought it was great when you started to laugh at the end.
Yeah -- well, I'm sorry I'm tying up Jane, I didn't realize you two would be going this late. Sorry.
Hi. Will I ever sing again?
No. That sounds more important. Let's forget about tonight.
No. Don't worry about it.
I'll put her on.
Aye, do.
Just wait.
I'm starving. There's got to be something open around here.
In fact, I'm not anything like him and... I guess I want you to know that.
That's a secret.
Fine... That guy's great.
You better come see this.
I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only. There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some sense.
It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked. Doesn't that make sense?
Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody -- it's against everything I've ever stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that -- they're hanging me for my beliefs.
They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it -- we could have a fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel things.
Yeah I know. I did.
I left them here. I was doing some work here.
He called this morning from Tuscarora. Asked me to meet him at 3:00 at the downtown heliport. He's on his way to Chicago.
You said "fuck".
Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.
Just five. It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
Pretty scary, huh?
I didn't say that.
No!
Oh, let's not--I, I don't know what the hell I'm talking about.
I-I-I know, but there's got to be some give and take.
You know, y-you have some very set plans on how your life should be structured. A-a house, uh, kids, certain schools, a h--, a home in Connecticut. I-it's all very...preconceived.
Have a good sleep.
My God! Wha-what is this? The Gestapo? No.
Low class of people there, Snoop.
Go away.
It smells like shit in here?
If you'll excuse me I'm not feeling so well.
Thank you for walking him.
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.
You know how that makes me feel, Deb? Wanta know how that makes me feel? Angry, Deb. Yesss, that's the word, angry. But if he makes you happy, you go right ahead. I want you to be happy, Deb. No matter what, no matter how angry it makes me, no matter how much it hurts. Be happy, Deb. Be oh, so very, very happy.
It's not the beer. He just wants to see me fail.
Yeah?
You're marrying him? Then why are you coming back to me?
The minute you see him, you'll know.
Glenn didn't tell you?
See you at seven-thirty in the lounge.
Well, why should I? Alright, what's your name, where do you live, when did you kill your parents?
You stand on your tiptoes.
Baby, please don't... I love you.
You are wonderful!
Yeah.
-- please, baby --
God bless ya, Rock.
Never mind--I'll pay for it now. It'll save time.
I admit it -- you are better than I am.
Then why are you smiling?
Didn't you hear Stoltzfus? What if he dies? Then the sheriff will come. They'll say we broke their laws
Rachel, this is a man's life, we hold it in our hands.
You better be keeping your mind on business. It's not just me you got to worry about. I've got some very unpleasant folks looking over my shoulder.
Yes --
And what is that?
Yes?
I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
You can do it.
Boy, you're so perfect you can look down on me?
It's all right--if you like honest faces--let's have another drink--Steward!
Very good shot.
Mm hm... Two ball, side pocket.
You know I gotta hunch, fat man. I gotta hunch it's me from here on in... One ball, corner pocket. I mean, that ever happen to you? When all of a sudden you feel like you can't miss? I dreamed about this game, fat man. I dreamed about this game every night on the road... five ball... You know, this is my table, man. I own it.
Your shot.
Charlie, I'm gonna take him.
That's what the game's all about.
You miss? Well, you don't leave much when you miss, do you, fat man?
I'll find you a priest.
What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's a good spot for it.
I don't want to hear it in there.
I don't get it!
-- I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.
-- I wouldn't believe you, no matter what you told me. You'd say anything now to get what you want.
Do I have to hear again what a great man your husband is? What an important cause he's fighting for?
I'm not fighting for anything anymore, except myself. I'm the only cause I'm interested in.
Turn-offs?
Soon as I get that bracelet back I'm going to relax. Wish the guy that borrowed it would help me out--I got to win that fifty bucks.
I know.
I know.
I do.
Diane Court.
Oh, I understand.
Dorsey.
Don't you agree, Jacques?
... I'm listening.
No, I have to ask you a favor... You're the only one who'll understand.
Hey, that's Dad's throne! How did Adrian get that? Is Dad okay?
I could do it if I tried. Even Kelly thinks so.
I meant he's a doctor.
The man and the woman are married --
I could take after Dad, too.
Don't you understand French?
I'm still having trouble with English.
Whatever my life is, I'm going to be friggin' sure I'm never disappointed --
I want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. Your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. They're going to say that you enticed Marsh -- led him down a dark path.
If I tell you, can you manage not to put it down or tell me why it won't work or is in bad journalistic taste or anything like that?
Anybody take it?
A few.
Did you fix the damn film? It broke in the last reel.
I know. Everyone went home. We offered them refunds.
You're not going anywhere, Harry.
Don't tell me, I know about these things. I've seen it before. It's all right. It's... all right. You're here. Oh, God, I love you, son.
Vultures...
I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive. That's not too shabby, is it?
Doc! How the hell are you?
I see. She must have been very happy here.
Oh shit, yeah. Can you lend some more money?
Hey Jahn.....You got a name for this thing?
The performance is free what more do you want....I've set that old phone up as a donation box and I'll get Jahn to write out a sign....Okay, let's get going.
Head the flyers up with Asylum and then put Debut of....Psychosis, Theatre experimental. That'll cover us if it flops. On the bottom put seek Asylum where the stars shine on Betlemska.
Why? We did pretty well, wouldn't you say?
Don't shout at me, Ben.
You miss the point.
Shaking hands. Well, that's not saying much for my wife, is it?
Listen to me. We got -- we got into bed with each other. But it was nothing. It was nothing at all. We might -- we might just as well have been shaking hands.
That's quite a statement.
It shouldn't make any difference what happened.
I think I've talked about this enough. I don't know how far I can go, Ben. I don't know if I can prosecute or not, but I think maybe I can. In the light of what's happened I think maybe I can get you behind bars if you ever look at my daughter again. I have seen Elaine and I have spent the afternoon taking steps to insure...
HUH?
A teacher! Dong!!! You know I admire brains. Take my brother Charley. He's very brainy. Very.
Not the way you re thinking. The women wanted me there for support. You can understand that.
A weekend?
Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
Do you want some mustard with this?
Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
Ride like wild fire, Jack.
You're on your own... like a true champion.
He'll not escape me.
Sure--and to show you I'm a regular fella-- Here's that twenty-five hundred.
Partners, ain't we?
About sixteen hundred.
Hey, what's this? Wearing Papa's things? Now that's cute. That's what I call real lovey-dovey. Yessir.
Your hair's cute like that. You should never comb it.
Sorry I didn't mean to
You like bourbon?
So could I.
On the handlebars or your shoulders?
You are a monster, Zorg!
One of the accountants.
I thought you said the eggs weren't...
You okay?
I gave you a baby last night.
They are beautiful.
You have been very good to me, Jennyhaydn. You said you wanted a baby, so I gave you one.
Do they talk?!
I understand.
It will be human and it will look like this. But when it comes it will know everything I know and everything you know. That is something from my planet that I want your baby to have.
That was quite an evening. Bourgeois, phony, decadent, stupid.
Cut his nose off.
A new comedy. By Will Shakespeare!
And his ears.
Hello?
We'll find out.
You must think... I'm the biggest pillock... In the world.
It's no problem. Anyway, I have some stuff I need to --
In the world.
In every sense. If at all possible.
Sorry we had to meet here. But I'm pressed for time.
They'll trace it.
You do?
Your father, he was dying. He was worried about you. He took your picture out to look at it. He called you his baby.
Because he believed me.
If I said that, would you stay?
What --
In a minute.
You're not yet three months, are you?
Check your mail tomorrow. I sent you a letter, a letter.
That's okay.
You sick?
Yeah?
Want an animal cracker?
So you guys got five hundred thousand dollars worth of cola that you're unloading -
Okay, I promise I will. Just come here a minute, I want to show you something.
Well, then, I'll tell you what I'd do. I'd jump Daisy into the river, and swim you both across, where no enemy could follow us.
Hi.
I'll look for 'em. How you doing?
Fine, I'm sure it's in the file at home. I'll call you when I find it, and then we'll talk.
Great... That's great.
There's something different about the sound of her voice... And what did she mean last night, she hasn't slept with him yet. Yet. What does "yet" mean, anyway? "I haven't seen... Evil Dead II yet." What does that mean? It means you're going to go, doesn't it?
Shut up! First you come waltzing into my life after two years. You're married. You killed a guy.
What's to think about?
Jesus, that Lynette! I rode her hard and put her up wet.
'Nellie's Nymphos!'
Could you believe those girls!
You're sure it's okay?
Something tells me you've been here before.
To a girl. Here.
What?
Brought us luck once, maybe it will again.
Finch, you got the Latin homework?
I thought you served misfits here!
I want a martini! It's New Year's Eve and I want a Martini!
What kind of bar is it if ya can't get a martini?!
Thank you, Mrs. Charles.
Well, we got the prom coming up, all these parties. We shouldn't upset our parents?
I don't know. I wouldn't know.
I can understand that.. But please don't start crying again.
Just stop, okay? Make something up, and that's what happened. Whatever you want. Write my confession, and I'll sign it. Just stop pushing me all the time! I can't take it! You're an infant! This is all a big party for you, but not for me! This is serious. And you -- Just... leave me alone, okay? You're fucking me up.
Yes.
Do you have any idea how difficult that's gonna be?
I'm offering a half a million dollars worth of white for two hundred thousand. How difficult can that be?
Your brother stumbled upon Adonis s little secret, didn t he? And traded his silence for a kid and some cash. And Adonis fell for it, bought him his kid, sent him away, and then killed him when he came back for more. Leon didn t come here to borrow money for prints. He came to extort a second kid s life. Your flunkey let him in, so his visit couldn t be concealed, hence the exhibition story. There was no exhibition. Just as you suspected. Remember, Deborah? Leon does his own prints. Wouldn t want anyone to interfere with his Art . I should have paid more attention to your words. Perhaps it s the way you say them...
Come on, try it. Ya feel the air on your body - ya little fella's flappin' in the breeze. ...everybody in the city is busy with their business and no one knows we're bare assed in the middle of it. Come on!
Really?
Yeah, this is Ronny.
Some people are very shy by nature.
What's wrong can never be made right.
Why didn't he call himself?
We will be fine!
I passed.
How do you know all this stuff about me?
I don't know anything that isn't police business.
She didn't ask me for the ride. She asked anybody.
Doyle. Joey Doyle's... .? ... .You're his... .
Actually, Stu, Julie doesn't get to decide. That's why she was having the nightmare. They're pulling the plug at nine AM.
Besides, Julie wouldn't...she'd never...
Farewell? You mean - you mean I'm -
It's a special kind of party. A farewell party. Do you...get what I'm saying?
I think I...I'm about to... Am I mistaken, or don't I get to... Is there some...
Well - yeah - but that doesn't...apply. It was different then. I was depressed. My life is great now. I'm in love!
Zackly.
Thanks, Jerry. Tell me something.
Bought the bottle, didn't I? To the United States of America. Long my she wave.
No, there are just a few things I want to ask you, and --
Now, Judy, it isn't anything to get --
Where's your manners? Make room for Homer, so's he can enjoy the view.
Now, now. He's a good boy.
Jack, you gotta watch your language 'round my daughter.
Judy --
Oh. How old?
Your mom got pregnant and I had to make choices. You don't have a choice.
What about everything I said to you this afternoon...
But but what about Steve?
I am one of those guys.
Oh shut up!!!
I'm not... Now, where are those shoes...
... I've got a right to say something. I mean, you're tying my hands here! They say you're not ready to know.
Do you know what the Little People just told me?
They said you're The One.
So you knew this young man before?
What?
Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis -- where?
Now, monsieur, you have no right...
I don't see him.
Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! What's that?
Just a moment. I hope you haven't closed this deal, Monsieur Mercier. It might bring you into serious difficulties.
Come here.
280, 290, 300 knots.
I'm sorry to do this to ya here in front of a crowd, but I want ya to stand up and make a nice apology to my girl.
That's good... Now go get yourself a beer. You fellas have alotta the same power Elvis had... Y'all know this one?
That so? You want to tell me what, if any, real thoughts you had lately?
You go. I'm staying with it.
No! Not again!
That's great.
Hi, Vicki. You look beautiful.
I don't know. They must think I look like this guy Gladstone.
But you're sure we've met, huh?
But we've got time.
Oh--I am him too!
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
Luke... what time is it?
You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "Dad."
... what?
Ha!
Hello, Ma, waddaya say, it's getting a little late.
I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
Forget it, Denham ... for Godssake
I'll see you there. Bye.
It's shorter than our practice runway.
What made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?!
-- what, who? Oh she's very nice, yes -- I mean normally ---
How old?
Good morning, Lotte!
I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey?
Sure you can. Come on.
Right now! It's very important, M'sieu Laval.
It may be important to you, M'sieu Giron--
I'm very sorry, but this is no time, M'sieu Giron--
Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married again.
I haven't any hard feelings.
Sure, come on. We'll have some lunch and you can tell me everything.
Those high heels would be a lot of use in the jungle -- and those nylons and six-ounce lingerie --
Well, they'd be very stylish in Finland -- just before you froze to death. Begin to get the idea?
You might have to, if you went with me. Ever try to keep warm in a C-54, at fifteen thousand feet, at twenty below zero?
Ever get shot at, run over, sandbagged at night because people got unfavorable publicity from your camera?
What?! A light! Yes, I've got a light!
Huh? Try and find a raincoat in Brazil. Even when it isn't raining Lisa, on this job you carry one suitcase. Your home is the available transportation. You sleep rarely, bathe even less, and sometime the food you even look at when they were alive!
So...you...survived the blast, did you?
We've arranged for you to take the blame. Everyone knows how you've been harassing the poor girl.
Please don't do this to me.
The police are on their way.
Sorry.
Can I pay you here? Can I pay you for our drinks and salad?
That's fine.
Well...
Well...
You sure you don't want a lift back home?
No thanks. It's not that far.
I don't think so.
Morning.
I don't know. I'm happy.
Edward, if the three of us sit down together we might as well announce our plans in the Wall Street Journal.
I'll see him alone. Everyone knows you're my muscle. We'll make it social. Tell Kross I'll meet him for dinner. Tonight if you can arrange it.
You shouldn't go alone. He might claim that you tried to black mail him.
I want to.
Oh, god, what?
I'll bring it back.
Wanna keep goin'?
No doctor!
See these? Found them in the box with the cards. These are stock certificates. IBM. AT T. Polaroid.
What do you want to do with it?
And if we can't find him?
What's wrong?
How much you think you're worth these days? I'm puttin' up the money, I'm puttin' up the time. For that I get seventy-five per cent return on my money -- if you win.
You think I can lose?
It all depends on what you're used to.
Ten reasons. Maybe fifteen. And also there's something in it for me.
Oh yeah, I figured that. How much?
Get the three thousand. Play Minnesota Fats again.
Why?
For me.
Seventy-five per cent.
For who?
Later.
I haven't been nice to you.
You were great the other night.
In fact, I think I talked with him, in Bonn.
Thanks. Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.
You cannot! Not for the Queen herself!
Uh..you're welcome.
It is, if you like idiots...
Seems like a nice place.
Are you kidding me? What's to like?
It's a nice place you got here. Real comfortable. Sweet little town, Fair Oaks. You like it here?
Fine. You got five...
We appreciate that. But you just poured me a drink, I'd like to enjoy your hospitality for a few minutes.
Isn't that the point?
What's the idea of telling me you just knew the Wolfe girl by sight?
No. Dr. Larch will be performing the procedure.
They come when you sleep.
Yes, sir.
That's right. And we all have to sleep, eventually.
Rheya.
For a reason that neither of us understand, you are forced to stay near me. That's all I know right now.
They put a gun on you, you still have a choice, don't you?
Harold?
You don't seem to be listening. I asked do you have any friends?
Huh?
None at all?
No.
Would you care to talk about this friend?
Well, maybe one.
Oh -- yes. The Singleman party.
The Singleman party, sir?
Yeah, but these guys have never seen a horse. They just jack off to Clint Eastwood.
It's in the main ballroom.
What?
How many people were in your old school?
Where's the beauty you promised me?
It was my joke. I was tired, and did not care to go farther. There's not prettier woman here than that. If she won't suit your fancy, my friend, then you must wait awhile.
The place seems more a farm than an inn-yard.
The people are great farmers, as well as inn-keepers.
Do you want to see the loveliest woman in Europe?
Ah! You sly rogue, I see that will influence you.
Upon my word, sir, I think you have acted very coolly.
And where did you say you were from?
Yeah, sure.
Uh, Mare, what kind of dog is Puffy?
You look awful.
Thank you.
Aren't you going to say, 'I told you so'?
If I was still alive, I probably would.
What can I say, Jack?
You don't have to say anything.
Hi, Jack.
Hi, David.
Pretty terrible shot.
Who were you really trying to kill last night?
I guess 'cause you remind me of someone I once knew, long ago before any of this craziness.
You know how I felt about her.
Who?
Do you think your friend's up in Heaven now, looking down on you and watching you all the time?
Boyfriend?
Hey what do I care...I mean, consider the sorts, a chick from Pennsylvania, who wears a mood ring.
Let me see if it changes colors on me.
Soon, soon. Say, this is my buddy Jack. He's getting married next week.
Gary.
Yeah. It's good. Feels good.
I'll have to think about it. I don't know about them. I do know one thing, We've got a lot invested in you. We'd hate to lose it. Even more than those other guys, Naval Aviation needs a very few, very good men.
I didn't say that. That's up to you. I think that if you do, if you choose to come back, you'll be a better pilot... a better man.
No, I'm sorry, I can't do it. We- we've blown it already. I-you know, uh, I-I can't go in in the middle.
You wanna get coffee for two hours or something? We'll go next-
Human beings can die.
But they are human. They certainly become human with incredible speed. First they're like they were in our memory, but then they fill in on their own. DNA doesn't determine the hundreds of trillions of connections that occur in the brain, it's not dense enough. They build up with experience.
But why is it doing what it's doing? Given it's resources, it could have done anything. Presented me with your double, and you with mine.
Perhaps it did.
I've never heard you express any desire to leave before now. Why now?
Well, I think we're reaching the point of diminishing returns here, right? Certainly it's learning more about us than we'll ever learn about it.
No.
Of course, when we return, we'll be regarded as lunatics if we tell the truth. We'll chalk it up to isolation, collective derangement.
We can liquidate the station. Take the Athena back.
Yeah. As an adult, I needed to find some way to experience intimacy and sex, but with rules that couldn t be violated.
What's wrong with the kid?
Yes, you are --
Of course not.
Hell, I'm just like him.
Sure. They got on my nerves, so I threw 'em out.
Oh God, I'm fucking nervous. I don't know if I'm ready for this, man.
Yes, if it isn't too late.
Nice day out - er, nice night - wasn't it? - isn't it?
I'm not going!
Let's go.
Well, the twelve o'clock show is completely different than the nine.
Charley Wade.
Godammit, George...
I think I've met you before, Mr. Brett.
I wish you wouldn't.
Pawn shop. What's to eat?
You're making me feel guilty again.
Yes. I told you. It was exactly like mine.
Yeah... I mean great.
Absolutely fine about it.
-- yes, Senator -- just a minute, dear --
Much better--thank you--
The nocturnal flying mammal?
No. Sit down.
Like one of Mom's?
Uh, no. There's a man who throws the ball -- to a man who has a bat.
Like a painting?
No, son. A pitcher.
That depends on what they see.
Huh?
It's wonderful.
Me? Oh, I see a small Ohio farm boy becoming a great soldier. I see thousands of marching men. I see General Lee with a broken heart, surrendering, and I can see the beginning of a new nation, like Abraham Lincoln said. And I can see that Ohio boy being inaugurated as President Things like that can only happen in a country like America.
What was that?
Good idea. Thank you.
Jack Foley, famous bank robber.
No. I don't think so. Not right now.
Poor guy.
Two. Sherry?... Nice joint. You look very pretty.
Hey, get us a couple of drinks here, will ya? J. T. S. Brown.
Maybe I'm not such a high-class piece of property right now. And a twenty- five per cent slice of something big is better than a hundred per cent slice of nothin'.
The pleasure is all mine.
Who, me? Why, I'm the whippoorwill that cries in the night. I'm the soft morning breeze that caresses your lovely face.
Don't let it bother you. You're giving it back to me in the morning.
Yeah. I got a name. Peter Warne.
I said with the mouth shut.
How long do you intend -- ?
I have to get you home by one.
Don't cut me.
I slept with the girl. I've got a wife in Tripoli. A girl comes up and points at you, you only see trouble.
Sorry about that.
Don't cut me. Come on.
Open it.
Do I knock or something?
Mind your own business. You just said that shit so you could look at her a little longer, anyway...
Why you always gotta embarrass me? I been eating lunch with you since grade school and you always gotta embarrass me!
...plenty
Who eats eggs for lunch, anyhow?
The party's over.
Keep going.
Good night.
I know. Is that nothing.
Before we do this.
Isn't that like waiting and seeing?
Just tell me. I'll do whatever you want to do.
That was a lifetime ago.
But that's all behind us now.
Of course not. It was just a negotiating ploy.
Have really held you under?
I'm sorry.
Important?
I want you back, Fran.
Not here, Fran. Can't we go some place else?
You're not giving me a chance, Fran. I asked you to meet me because -- I have something to tell you. FRAN Go ahead -- tell me.
Do you think this cross will protect you?
It's time to put this person where he belongs.
Shortie, look!
Yeah, you were saying?
What is it?
We'll stay at the Plaza --
I was thinking, I have to go up to Boston for the AAP convention and then visit Winston-Hughes about switching over our computers. Why don't we meet in New York for Valentine's Day weekend?
Now, you've probably already guessed that George never leaves Bedford Falls.
Will somebody get the damn dog out-
Rheya...
"And Death Shall Have No Dominion".
Okaaaaayyyy.
Did you know he was hanging around Julia?
No.
Excuse me?
Well, listen, that's, a nice bi-it's a biblical name. Right? W-What does he call you? Bathsheba?
M'm.
I don't think I know that one.
They were in the Army. Like your father.
Mr. Deeds is drawing on his warped imagination!
My schedule is not subject to the whims of lunatics.
That guy who got shot--
What about everything since?
What? What do you remember about that -- dumper?
But you can't say that Dumper was Tom Grunemann.
Everything that's happened since Tom Grunemann disappeared. The phone calls and the --
Sire, you know how bad I am at this sort of game.
Are you kidding? And face a court- martial?
Sure. Lots of times.
Like even today. I woke up this morning, you know? And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing.
Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything.
I don't think you trust anybody, do you?
I'm getting that way, too.
Is he here?
What's wrong?
You want to lie down for a while?
Don't worry, I'm not going to hit you.
Maybe somebody felt that four shares were too many --
No, about Scobie, I mean. I can't think of any reason why he was killed.
No sense messing up the streets.
I'm sorry.
Hm?
Alex --
Yes, I know.
What makes you think that this somebody will be satisfied with three? He wants it all, Alex -- that means we're in his way, too.
There is something to be said for silence
Those 80 acres, that cross the stream, what do you think of them?
Please! Leave the house.
You have to leave the house immediately!
No buts. Now. Out.
Marylin?
Yes Sir.
You are on my ground.
You upstart inky pup! Now I will show you your place, which is in hell!
It's alright. I know what you mean. Let's start at the top.
Yeah. That's how you end up with a 400 billion dollar deficit.
You could buy it on payments.
Well, there's lots of places where I think you can save, but I'm not the one who's ....... I mean, I'm not the one who's not the Pres...
So what do we do?
Well, yeah. But you gotta start making some choices.
I'm not surprised. Can we save anywhere?
You know -- priorities. Remember when you couldn't get your car fixed cause you wanted to get that piano?
Choices?
A yert. Ruth is a living legend, Rex. At a time when most women are in Boca, having early bird specials -- she's working so her husband can be in Montana. In a yert.
I got to go see somebody in San Antonio today. Your memory gets any better, I'll be back tonight.
What?
Sort of, um...
Yeah? I can't remember that album very well. I remember liking it. But --
Well, I wouldn't want to be --
Judy, please it can't matter to you...
...crazy! No shit, Shaft!! And you ain't far behind...
No!... WE didn't anything...
Fuck the profile! That's the same guy!!
It just didn't fit her profile...
Man, you have got to get some therapy.
Don't Don't you talk about Betty like that. I don't care who she ends up being, you never use that word again. Got it?
I do not know how the fuck you lasted an hour in this job! Dragging our asses around with the answer to our prayers in your motherfucking jacket... a picture of that cunt right next to the...
Dave, these things get awfully complicated sometimes...
...yeah, I got it. Come on, you're stretching out my vest...
I said 'got it?'
But we went there. We saw those kids.
Make it collect.
Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action. Resort, upstate.
Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
Maybe. I'll call him.
Well, we didn't expect that much. I'm sure I can get her to settle quietly for one million.
I'll come along.
Well done, lad.
Is she... dead?
Archers! Bring down that spider! I'll deal with this other creature...
Stay on your guard, Jack. The bug is enchanted surely.
No, thank the Lord, but she be sore envenomed by the spider's bite.
We're blind now. Oona was our eyes and ears. How do we find the Castle Couer de Noir without her?
Hi.
Hi. Is Annette at home?
I've never done this before.
Screening calls. Any suggestions?
Like what?
It's nothing. Will you trust me?
Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.
The hospital? What kind of tests?
Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.
Yes... sure. I'll take the sofa.
That's not true. Some of us have great stories... pretty stories that take place at lakes with boats and friends and noodle salad. Just not anybody in this car. But lots of people -- that's their story -- good times and noodle salad... and that's what makes it hard. Not that you had it bad but being that pissed that so many had it good.
You could've asked.
Where did you learn how to drive like this?
My vocal cords are fine, but Fred's ain't. He's been barking, eating the seats and driving me crackers. Hear that? Where's his chow?
In money.
Ready for another?
Wouldn'ta guessed it, that's sure.
Oil, gas, cattle, farmin'. Ain't nobody shows off around here. Iguana County's one of the richest in Texas.
They look like a bunch of good ol' boys to me. I guess it's oil money, huh?
Then you're a member... Three or four millionaires in here right now.
What's that?
I been studyin' a situation over in Lobo, take two men to handle it.
You.
I'm good.
Did you ever got ahold of Maya yesterday?
Tell me where you are, or just leave the line open so I can trace you.
Well...What are we doing?
Transfer.
Come on! Six major earthquakes in the last three years? The space shuttle in orbit for every one of them?
Microwave. Five minutes.
I don't know, Ma. I'm all knocked out. I may just hang arounna house.
A cure?
What?! He told you? When?
You two faced bastard. I knew you were full of shit.
You're exactly right, Andy. I enlisted both Serafine and your uncle to obtain ADM. And now I'm counting on your assistance too.
Why the fuck would I do that?
Who's she gonna marry?
It's all right here. Give me the thousand and it's yours.
I wouldn't trust you as far as I could throw that desk.
Wait a minute, Joe. Use your bean. I couldn't afford to hand you a phoney yarn, like that. I'd be crazy. There isn't a newspaper in the country'd give me a job after that! I could go to jail!
Really? Married Kevin? Her junior high sweetheart... What chance would I have had against that? None, no chance. That's just fate.
Without a song in my heart.
Blue moon...
Blue moon... Blue moon...
Technically, I'm number one. I went out with her a week before Kevin did. Her first boyfriend. Me.
Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
Get the Governor on the phone!
The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. Who else knows about this?
Yeah?
Pure politics!
An attempt to ruin us!
I'm not in his shoes, so leave me out of it.
But you don't look very happy.
I know more than I want to know about it. Who's the father?
I don't like watching anyone be sick.
I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
How about California?
That's the way it's done.
What are you talking about?
No really, one of them marries me and then leaves me quicker than you can say Indiana Jones -- and the other, who seriously ought to have known better, casually marries my best friend.
I think you have forgotten... what an unusual situation you have here -- to find someone you actually love, who'll love you -- the chances are... always miniscule. Look at me -- not counting the American -- I've only loved two girls in my whole life, both total disasters.
I got time, Bert.
What's he saying?
This is wonderful!
You want me to tell her for you?
- to her cooking.
Hana was just telling me that you were indifferent -
I don't think it's indifference.
We're always trying to fuck them... they know it and they like it and they don't like it... that's just how it is... look, it's got nothing to do with you, man. It just happened. Felicia's got nothing to do but shop and get her hair done and she knows she's getting older... her daughter hates her, what's she going to do, go to PTA meetings?
And I'm telling you there's nothing there to explore.
I don't believe you.
No!
Twould be to compare one star with another in the summer sky.
Exceeding fair.
Princess Lili, Godwin's daughter. She was with me when calamity struck, but after I could find no trace of her.
Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
With a woman who is completely charming, be she a princess or a woman of the lowest condition, and who, regardless of her rank, will show me some kindness, tonight.
Then I will respectfully take leave of her.
Yes -- but I am afraid of being deceived.
I ask only a payment on account today -- after that, you will find me undemanding, obedient and discreet.
It was in my name so he wouldn't lose it. He stole it from everyone that deserved it by putting me on title.
I aimed high.
Don't put yourself out.
Baby. You are so HOT!
Words can hurt very much.
You know, Miles, after my wife -- wife's mastectomy -- things were never the same. This might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, Massey, but... I like my women with two boobs.
What a touching story.
Good.
I don't know, Willow.
I don't know, doesn't make any Sense. I almost can't look at You. Like it hurts.
Well you're different, no arguing That. But you're a lady all right. I'll take my oath on it.
WHEN I SHOOT, YOU BREAK LEFT..3..2
I GOT NO TONE. IT MIGHT GET YOU.
WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE? SHOOT IT.
I GOT A WINDER LEFT, BUT NO GOOD TONE ON IT.
I CAN'T LOSE HIM, CAN YOU GET OFF A SHOT?
Do you know the... soccer stadium?
Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
And...?
Let's go dancin', peanut. I'm ready.
There's worse things that can happen to a man, honey.
The Man in Black?
His true love is marrying another tonight, so who else has cause for Ultimate Suffering? Excuse me --
-- Fezzik, please --
Everybody ... MOVE!!
Your guess is as good as mine.
I don't know.
Let's see. Where's it from?
Two weeks?
You've been unconscious since you were brought in two weeks ago.
So I'll die without a son.
Why, why do you think that is?
Now get this, Gallagher - Smith. That's the name.
Ah! Thank you, Joe. Tell you what - we'll have one of those parties down at your house - one of those spaghetti parties, you know. Gee, we haven't had one of those in a long time, have we Gallagher?
Joe! A little snifter. Say, wasn't I a lucky guy to fall into a girl like that, huh? Look at that! I don't know how I rate that, Gallagher. Gosh, there's a swell girl. I want you to meet her.
Who - Anne? Sure, Anne would love that.
Remember the time we had a spaghetti party, and while I was serving the spaghetti I dropped it on the floor, and while those mugs weren't looking, I picked it up and served it to them anyway! Remember that? Yes, Anne would love that.
I felt funny about it afterwards. It's verboten, huh? I thought since I did it for real the first time -- but I get you. That's not the reason you're not coming?
Then give me a minute...
Why?
Anything.
I'm still here.
Sure.
Why aren't you understanding?
Nothing.
Wait... He wants to give her...?
You makin' any headway?
Move on. Right. That's what I'm going to do. In a few months, boom, I'll be fine, I'll just grow a new heart.
She just needs time to cool off I'll give it a day.
Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news. As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
He was interested.
-- But he was concerned about the timing?
The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.
'It's up to Joe'?
What is this?
Something big going on somewhere?
Who buys them? Tax collectors?
That dress should be listed on the stock exchange.
Depends on the quote. Let's see -- there's the plane tickets over, import duties, hidden taxes, profit markups --
Good night.
It's just a run-of-the-mill Monday. The calendar's loaded with them.
O.K.! Send that!
Okay... Night, baby.
Of course I like children.
I'm around you and I like you, don't I?
We live together now.
Sorry I'm late.
Oh, well, God, I can imagine what you wrote.
Really?
Hmm.
Yeah.
Well, you know, I-I-I...you know, if you want me to, I'll read it.
Jane's the office manager. She handles payroll and petty cash. But she leaves early on Fridays.
Of course. I'm not a monster.
You promised to let me kiss you.
I swear.
I don't want to kiss you here. I want to kiss you there.
Maybe we'll be roommates, Seeger, and you'll find out how funny I really am...
Touch of the flu.
I know.
I think they missed their chance with her.
Watch out!
You heard me!
Stop bein' so damn understandin'.
I know just how you feel, son. But believe me, you're going about it the wrong way.
Don't look like there's a right way.
Well, you have to be reasonable. Now they say you're a troublemaker. That's no good. Use a little psychology. Make 'em think you're going along - and get what you want.
Kate...
Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there?
No.
What part?
No.
Trying to capture his brother in a flask and preserve the balance of good and evil on Earth.
Right.
Oh, God, no!
Don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. You don't want to look shifty, do you?
I wasn't going to say --
The slip, son, the slip; can you not conceive?
We fuck like minks. We raise rugrats. We live happily ever after.
We fuck like minks. We forget the rugrats. We live happily ever after.
And the left side of your face is the good one. Go again. And try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence -- punch one idea a story. Punch -- come on --
No?
No. No.
Where do the air ducts lead?
Get out!
Wait a minute, Gordon I
Don't "Joe" me.
Joe, listen
What?
Be at the State House, Courtroom Nine, at ten o'clock tomorrow.
Get out of here!
You're being served with a subpoena, Mr. Malloy.
I told you I don't know nothin' and I ain't saying nothin'.
You can bring a lawyer if you wish. And you're privileged under the Constitution to protect yourself against questions that might implicate you in any crimes.
You mean about the Andrews' kid?
Okay, Joe. Listen you know I've always liked you. Anytime I could do you a great turn anytime I ran into a story that looked good I always came running to you, didn't I? Well, I got one now. Those wires I sent you were on the level. It's the biggest scoop of the year. I'm giving it to you, Joe.
I want two men stationed in that tier, and I want men with rifles all along the walkway.
Even better. Wayne call your station, tell 'em we're going live a little early today. Make it happen!
She got gaps. I got gaps -- together we fill the gaps.
Ya really like her?
C'mon, ya screwin' her?
That's what I was afraid of.
Why don't you two get out there and dance?
It didn't used to be that way.
One who's not a mutant.
And if possible, I'd like to marry someone from Pasadena.
Two weeks.
I never drink in the morning. And every time you send my shipment over, it's always just a little bit short.
Where the hell did you come from?
Or the sexual habits of locusts?
No.
Nothing. Good night.
Good night.
Do you know what's wrong with you?
What?
... Uh... we seem to be all out of Ethel Merman.
What do you think?
How about... Zbiegnew Speizak's "The Purple Bread," an intensely portrayed tale of love and envy set against the sweeping background of a Polish bakery. In subtitles.
We need to talk.
Last night a guy named John Townsend tried to shoot me and now I find out you knew him. What the fuck is going on?
Eh, no. Thank you.
We're going to swim "one or two kilometers" across open sea, from one uninhabited island to another. Something goes wrong. What then?
Yes, of course I can swim. How far do you think it is?
Oh. Great. Not far at all. I don't like to be negative, but do you think we should let someone know where we're going?
"Good night, good night. As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?"
What's that?
Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
Please, sit.
Right. The eight billion.
Where the money is.
No news from Manchester yet -- Do you think we ought to postpone the conference?
Now that that's settled, why not make the game a foursome?
What is it you want?
Why? If they could never take title.
I didn't get to see what's on the disks but I can guess. Do you want to hear my terms or not.
You are playing a very dangerous game, I suggest you make it easy on yourself and tell me where they are.
Not all of them!
Good try Mr. Greenwell but a little late. We have analyzed the contents of that drum, the remains of the disks are there, just as you said.
I'm not sure it's possible.
First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
Miss Marsh.
What?
Your mother?
Adonis thought your brother s body d be found reasonably quickly when he hung it in Epping Forest, didn t he? Seemed like a good idea. An ex-junkie, obsessed with death; the perfect candidate for suicide. He just forgot one thing: forest ramblers are rare during your average blustery English November. An Englishman might have thought of that, but a Brazilian...
Leon s not found, your parents worry, talk of hiring help to find him, even mention their manhunter friends perhaps... and Adonis panics, takes control, brings me in reckoning a small- time detective is unlikely to dig up anything awkward, not before Leon s found anyhow. He must have kicked himself when he learned I d exceeded his expectations.
What do you mean, No , Mrs De Moraes?
Does the name Pierre Dreyer mean anything to you? He s a client of mine and a friend of your husband.
What will this prove?
What's that supposed to be, psychology?
Jesus. I don't even wanna ask what you did to make this Melendez guy talk.
They skipped that step.
And that's what caused the contamination?
No shit.
I'd like to come, too. See Susan strut her stuff.
You're on, Quin-cee. Destination Hospital. Joe, you'll be the Tour Guide. Okay? How's that sound to you?
You're not far wrong.
Well, maybe next time Joe goes, he'll take us along.
Perhaps you could remind me.
I'll make a note of it. Anything else?
Okay, we'll see you tomorrow.
Maybe I should. But I was never much on killin'. Anyway, he moved too quick and I just got him through the shoulder. Looks pretty peaceful up ahead.
Maybe you shoulda killed him.
I caught up with Lednov in Nogales. He didn't like the idea of comin' back across the border but he came. I turned him over to the sheriff and -- that's the story.
Oh... that's the time you went away.
The meeting is arranged. Captain Best is waiting for you now.
McKinney's the name.
We coulda got two third-class!
I thought that was your duty, Abbe, not mine.
But we also fall in love; we build cities, we compose symphonies, and we endure. Why not put that in your books as well?
It's a fiction, not a moral treatise.
And such puny scope! Nothing but the very worst in man's nature!
I write of the great, eternal truths that bind together all mankind! The whole world over, we eat, we shit, we fuck, we kill and we die.
It's not even a proper novel! It's nothing but an encyclopedia of perversions! Frankly, it even fails as an exercise in craft. The characters are wooden; the dialogue is inane. Not to mention the endless repetition of words like "nipple" and "pikestaff" --
There I was taxed; it's true.
Enough to discern its tenor.
And --?
My name is Count d'Algout. I telephoned.
I was wondering what that was.
Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it. The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me.
Not now, Elaine!
I've got it, Elaine! I've figured out what's wrong with the shuttle!
But I speak English.
I just upped my price
What?
A hundred bucks a date.
Forget it.
I'm on it
Watching the bitch trash my car doesn't count as a date.
Great. You can go in my place.
Hey, baby, you could get sent to war, get your ass shot down.
I'm not a doctor!
Not sure. I'll have everything you need tomorrow.
He smells like he could put you to sleep!
It's because he's too tired to sleep. He has to.
Good idea... kill me.
Not pure evil. That's correct.
Yes... and you are?
Thank you. Do you work in the building? You coming from the party?
May I help you?
Before you went over to the Germans, before you got Rommel's spy across the desert and inside British headquarters. He took some pretty good photographs - I saw mine in that torture room in Tobruk, so they made an impression.
There are a few million miles to go yet.
You're a molecule in chaos, a discontinuent aberration. Maybe you've just got powers of precognition. Well, maybe you're just out of whack.
I know. Perhaps you could join us for dinner tomorrow, to regale our group with your heroic tale?
A lifelong problem, I'm afraid.
Well? You have all the answers. How is that possible?
Check-out time! Please vacate the room.
God dammit, Stifler!
SUCK ME, BEAUTIFUL!
Tell me, Walter, are all those stories I hear about my uncle true?
Okay, don't stop.
Oh that's really reassuring. And don't call me Nova anymore. I'm a fraud.
Where's Bella?
It's not important.
What pills did you take? You sound more like someone on a general anesthetic. Maybe I'd better speak to you tomorrow.
Down Kensington Church Street, then Knightsbridge, then Hyde Park Corner.
No. Are you going to the Correspondents' Dinner on Saturday?
No. Were you going to you?
I'm sorry nobody could come.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
She was right to leave me.
Bullshit. From where?
Just tell me where I can find him, friend.
You got that wrong, mister. I am.
He's my partner.
It's a pair of earrings. I saw 'em in the mall one day, and I thought, damn, those would look good on those beautiful earlobes. So I bought 'em. And I said to myself, next time Erin says something nice, does something nice, I'll surprise her with 'em. Know how long ago that was? Six months. In six months, you haven't said one nice thing to me. That's a long time.
She needs to be changed again. Sorsha crosses her arms in a hugg and watches as Willow changes the baby. Soon the baby stops crying. Re- lieved yet still anxious, Sorsha paces to a mirror. Willow rocks the baby gently, absently looking at the fire. Then his eyes focus on the fire.
Comrades, if we ring nine times... let's go in.
They tell me when you ring once the valet comes in; when you ring twice you get the waiter; and do you know what happens when you ring three times? A maid comes in -- a French maid.
A thousand dollars! Get out of this office before I throw you out bodily.
About this.
Never mind . . . Listen suppose I should tell you that Ellen Andrews is going to have her marriage annulled.
Just a minute -- just a minute -- I have nothing against the idea but I still say let's go back to the Hotel Terminus. Moscow made our reservations there, we are on an official mission, and we have no right to change the orders of our superior.
You're drunk.
Lois, you're amazing.
How are things in Moscow?
No way.
Quaffable but far from transcendent.
Nice.
You said it! How about a little action?
Now there's a girl who knows how to pour. What's your name?
Could you do away with her dinner, and any evidence of her, and bring me an big glass of vodka?
Madmartigan.
Go ahead, pick it up if you want.
Healy you dog!
Right, right, so g-get back to what we were discussing, the failure of the country to get behind New York City is-is anti-Semitism.
Max, my serve is gonna send yuh to the showers-
Oh, you got a headache!
Bad?
Jesus!
Well, I'm-I'm gonna take another in a series of cold showers.
What was what?
What was it?
How do you shave in there?
You said this afternoon that your husband was mixed up in something.
Look, I know it's asking you to stretch your imagination, but can't you pretend for a moment that I'm a woman and that you're a --
What your husband was mixed up in.
Why? Don't they believe in angels?
You don't huh? Well, you got any money?
No.
No wonder you jumped in the river.
I jumped in the river to save you so I could get my wings.
Oh-oh. Somebody's just made it.
Made what?
Every time you hear a bell ring, it means that some angel's just got his wings.
Where to?
I could go out of town.
Okay.
Could we go somewhere?
That's the physicist's playground.
This is a different one.
Good luck with yours, Kit.
You do, you don't. She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it. Don't you see? No, you don't.
A sleeping pill. Do you want yours?
Into what?
Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation.
I love her.
You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
What does it want?
Everybody okay up here?
Uh, no.
It's up to you now, Angel!
Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!!
Is that all?
And you must be Ringo. Look, Darling, Johnny Ringo. The Deadliest pistoleer since Wild Bill, they say. What do you Think, darling? Should I hate him?
No, the boyfriend.
He's drunk.
I fell in love.
Yeah and you're a slut, so what?
Shall I look after the rest?
I'm sorry but I think you better talk to someone else.
Eleven-hundred. That's my lowest offer.
It's not what it looks like!
Can I buy this Otis Redding single off you?
They got him! Wait a minute -- hold the wire. They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
What is it?
Well, maybe the slope here is throwing it off some. We ought to find a more flat place.
How do you know that?
What about Miss Lawson?
You lied to me!
I just left Joanne Braslow. She told me she saw you doing cocaine at Marsh's house!
Who's dying?
Seriously, Lloyd.
Would you like to have me turn around for you, Bingy?
If I profane with my unworthiest hand This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
Tomorrow? Tomorrow... as quick as that?
Oh sure, it's honest. But somehow, I can't picture you with a guy who sells policies.
I wish you everything I couldn't give you, Hildy.
Yeah?
Tell me.
I'll wait here.
Oh, my holy stars! A Negro!
Nine-thirty, Mr. Preysing keeps us waiting.
Erin --
I'm John Cedar - of the New York firm of Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington.
Yes.
Mr. Longfellow Deeds?
How do you do.
How do you do.
Who are they?
Jeanne, calm down. You can't blame the people -- they've been hearing all about you for weeks.
That's all I wanted to hear. 'Cause I'm never going to give up on us. It's easy to fall apart in a crisis. It's easy to be selfish and say goodbye and good luck. But this is more than love. This is a mental decision. Just wait till tomorrow, when you see your birthday present. Then you'll understand.
With what?
I told you you'd get your money back.
He thinks I care about the money. I care about you. Do you care about me, Eddie? We're together a long time, night and day. So how do you say goodbye? You gimme the car and a hundred bucks. You think I care about the dough, the car? I care about you. This boy is the greatest pool hustler you ever saw. A real high-class con man. He can charm anybody into anything. Did he ever tell you how well we were doing on the road? We had everything: we ate good, we slept late, we had money to burn. Whisky, dames... Excuse me... I'll tell you what -- take her along.
Never been out of it. I'm gonna beat that fat man... with that curly hair, and those diamond rings, and that carnation.
This boy's crazy. They wiped the floor with him. They beat his brains out and he wants to go back. What for? To take another beating?
I'll connect. I'll get you your money back.
Are you figuring on going back to Ames to play Minnesota Fats again? Is that what's on your mind?
Don't worry about it. I'll raise the money.
Oh yeah? Where?
You have to go for help.
Sit here. Cognac -- for you?
--and I guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... I suppose the most important thing, really. I don't know. Anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. It's my shrink, really.
I don't know exactly. I could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... I thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7-11--
You see someone?
I don't agree. Why do you have to keep changing your mind all the time?
Hello, Vi.
She's hungry.
We think she can be dissuaded. Have you had a glance at the diary?
Not too protracted, I hope.
The Queen wishes to publish an account of him.
Well the thing is your room is right next door to ours, and so we thought, well, I thought, if you were willing we might move you to Grammoo's room, and use your old room for the nursery. See we're gonna be up half the night with a newborn and there'll be a lot of noise....
I got a card from your Uncle Phil in Los Angeles today, said he went body surfing.
But I feel like My friends won't talk to me.
Thanks just the same.
Edie.
Oh, it is.
Better now. Where 'you at?
No.
It's been about a year and a half.
Sure you do --
Look, Doctor, I don't want to be rude, but --
Who the hell is Lucy Delaney?
Where is your luggage?
What?
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Sir?
Oh no.
Of course.
I mean I'd -- I'd rather not go to the trouble of bringing it all in. I just have a toothbrush. I can get it myself. If that's all right.
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself. I just have the toothbrush to carry up and I think I can manage it myself.
I'll have a porter show you the room.
Doesn't matter. Move on.
I don't know about this, Dom.
Uh-huh.
What's wrong, sweetheart? Did I do something? What did I do?
You know, a lot of people have misconceptions of how she died.
That's what happened. In fact, when she died, it was considered to be the happiest time of her life. She'd been fucked over so much by men she didn't trust them. She was havin' this relationship with this guy and he asked her to marry him. Now, other people had asked to marry her before, but she couldn't be sure whether they really loved her or were just after her money. So, she said no. And the guy says, "Look, I really love you, and I wanna prove it. So have your lawyers draw up a paper that says no matter what happens, I can never get any of your money, and I'll sign it." So she did, and he asked her, and she said yes. And once they were engaged he told her a secret about himself that she never knew: he was a millionaire.
I'm thirty-four.
...you teach chemistry? That's funny. Where? What school?
Benjamin Franklin, where's that? Brooklyn? I went to Theodore Roosevelt right up here on Fordham Road. It's right arounna corner from my house. I have a cousin who's a teacher. He teaches Latin. He lives in Chicago. He was studying to be a Jesuit, but he gave it up after his first vows.
And as for you, waiter--
I want to see that moon in the champagne.
No.
When you get engaged?
Fast.
I don't know.
Why?
Goodnight.
Well, that doesn't make 'em any less hungry.
What? There must be 2000 of them out there.
Homer liked it! Didn't you?
He loved it! Didn't you?
Bye bye, Jane. And don t be naughty.
I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
Blood.
How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?
The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
We don't have time.
We'll make time. Where's some paper. We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
What can you do when you have to be a man?
Well, now--
Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
No one.
Yeah, you told me that later.
I remember.
Your back to me. In that orange sweatshirt I would come to know so well and even hate eventually. At the time I thought, how cool, an orange sweatshirt.
Vada, we're trying to work here.
Get wise to yourself, Sally--you're no sob story.
Yes, sir.
I don't understand. You just said he said no.
No! Now we're inverted!
I care for her.
Good stuff.
How much skin and stem contact?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
French or American?
Huh. That explains all the tannins. And how long in oak?
Ahm... room service.
I thought she'd get a kick out of it.
Me, too.
We established that we have no communication.
You'll figure it out. I'm not worried about you. Keep writing.
It's hard. We started going to a marriage counselor.
That's ok.
Shut up, Frank.
Wesley didn't even want to come up here. He warned me, but I insisted... I have to ask you, Betty...are you crazy?
Betty, I don't wanna shrivel up alone in some stinking prison. No way. I've got some professional pride. And I don't want anybody else to get the credit for taking me out.
So all this... really was because of that soap opera? My son is dead because you came out here to be with that doctor? A fake doctor?
When a Roman general knew a battle was lost, he'd throw himself on his sword.
Did... did you really come here because you love this guy?
Francesca. Robert.
I found this Chicago station before. Wait a minute... Here it is.
Well, thank you for all your help, Mrs. Johnson.
Want another cigarette?
No, doctor.
Any letters?
Shouldn't we have invited Tom over?
You were so good to me. I swear I never meant to hurt you. We were together what, five years?
Then it's Godspeed, Screwball.
Aye. Before the wee pesties attacked.
Have the engineers corrected for alignment and trajectory?
That's it!
Fire away!
Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
Nothing. Go back to the show, Paula.
She said you told her in every letter how much you loved her, how you wanted to marry her, have children with her...
I wrote. Not every week...
I found them, pard, and read them myself, right after she did it!
I never said any of that!
What did you call her? What did I hear you call her, you son of a bitch?
Okay, I wrote those things... and yeah, I had big thoughts of getting together with your mom... but when she hit me with being pregnant, I saw who she was. I'd had quiff lay that shit on me before!
He's probably right -- let's call a delay...
Well, I --
Es mi novia.
So she did witness it?
Maybe we'll clean that thing out back up, have a barbecue next weekend. We could invite him and his wife over.
A woman can write a check.
So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
You said a woman couldn't have done it.
Could I have that in American?
'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
How is she?
And the guy saying he wasn't gonna take any more shit from anybody...
You're sure easy to talk to. I wonder -- say we met under different circumstances and got to talking, say you were in a bar and I came up to you -- I wonder what would happen.
Rex sent me two humidors full of pre- Castro Cubans.
No. No. I don't have a... no. It was from a client.
Yeah. Mom. Mom and brother.
Me. Yes.
Hmmm...
Wonder what he said.
Well, there you go. On for a video fest tonight? I've got some absolute classic.
Yes, she is fairly fabulous.
Imagine -- somewhere in the world there's a man who's allowed to kiss her.
I'm glad you have such confidence in me.
Honey.
I'm the President and as they say 'The buck stops here.' So I take full responsibility for every one of my illegal acts.
Die, you pond scum!
I'm getting over it. If a relationship isn't working, you can't force it.
There's something dangerously wrong with this ship, Elaine. I know its the wiring. That toilet's just the tip of the iceberg.
I opened this panel and a vacuum cleaner hit me.
We were in love but I'm not sure I know what love is anymore.
Hey, Rona. Sorry I'm late.
It don't matter. It's my reputation. These guys think they can get off light. It's bad for my reputation -- It's bad for business. See ya killer.
You're looking fit.
Just what I said. Don't look so scared.
How about it?
Just a habit. Mr. Schuyler is a bit put out by all the rumors going around.
Yeah. Wouldn't be no picnic for you. I ain't exactly housebroken.
She don't mean nothin' to me. That's all over. Hell, baby - I'm askin' you to marry me. I guess you want a big scene, huh?
And that's how much I'm saying.
Where is he, before we beat it out of you?
Do you want us to call the cops and have them give you the boots?
Come on, you! Before we slap you down.
That's right, you're gonna do what I say. Joey. I want to help you out of this.
You went to school with these people.
It's in Michigan. Honestly, what do I have in common with those people? Or with anyone?
Why don't you want to go to your high school reunion?
See you next week.
We've spent a lot of time discussing those years. Remember we said that fear is a transfer of the bodily hurt associated by experience with the thing feared, to the thought of the thing. Thus we fear a dog without distinctly imagining its bite.
Come on.
We can still take the offer, Rod.
Right?
Let me hear you say that! I so unhappy she runned away that I killed myself-- that what happen here, ain't that right?
There's more than one laceration, more than one cut.
That's 'cause I sticked my own knife in the wound--after she go, I sticked my own knife in there. I poked it all around, I just tryin' to find the same place she got me.
That's right! A girl's gotta know how to defend herself, don't she?
Wait a minute -- let's talk this over first. Just what are you going to tell her?
You better figure it out -- exactly. Suppose she asks you why you didn't come home last night?
Who?
That's right. I know you understand how I feel, Homer--you is breakin' them rules, too. Ain't that right?
Great. Look -- have you seen The Music Man?
No.
Here you are, Baxter. Have a nice time.
Oh, no sir. Certainly not. Anyway, it's none of my business -- four apples, five apples -- what's the difference -- percentage-wise?
You too, sir.
Good night.
I almost didn't recognize you -- this is the first time I've ever seen you in civilian clothes.
Oh -- Miss Kubelik. I've been waiting for you. FRAN You have?
Well, just stay healthy. I will show you the kwan.
Hey, that's my word, okay?
You touch her for the first time, and suddenly... you're home. It's almost like...
A big difference, if someone found it we should keep looking, if they didn't we're just wasting our time.
Don't forget, the girls change their names if they got married.
We had a kid pass out in the men's room. The town isn't much.
I'm gonna have the game of my life on Monday Night Football, and show all these motherfuckers.
He was having some fun. Yeah, well he's dead. Come on, let's go in.
I don't know. For your hair. For your beautiful dress. For... you know, I feel like a man again. You know I love the Opera. You know it's been a long time since I've been to the Opera.
Marc Chagall. A Russian.
Now?
You know how it is, Colonel--first time away from home, dealing with new people--I remember my first hitch--
Substance abuse?
I don't rate it.
Are you screwy?
What truth?
Well, yeah, but I went through the Program. I haven't had a drink since--
I meant on the post. In general. How are you dealing with it?
White or black?
Hey! Somebody's coming!
You be careful. I'm a powerful sorcerer. I could turn you into a toad just like that.
Why.
Do any other daikinis ever come by here?
Sorry?
Fifty will still get you a hundred.
This is enough for me.
I guess that cinches it, eh, Mr. Charles? He killed them both - Julia Wolf and Nunheim.
She's ready to talk. It won't do any harm, though - to find out where he is.
What happened, Angie, was that we thought we were just gonna go for a short walk, and then we thought we were gonna come right back, but we got to talking. Listen, Angie, I want you to meet Clara... Clara, this is my best friend, Angie. I told you about him.
I'm gonna take Clara home. It's close to one.
Waddaya gonna do now?
Where you been, for Pete sakes?! I been looking all over for you.
I been looking all over for you!
I looked for you, Angie, before I cut out, but I couldn't find you.
What for?
You want me to ride down with you?
Where's Charlie? I was in town about a year ago and caught one of his commercials. Really made me laugh.
Edie!
But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back.
Well...
I'm gonna have a corned beef.
Okay. Yeah.
My first... Yes, she was nice, but you know, uh, it was my fault. I was just... I was too crazy.
No, but like my dad said, "There's only so many ways you can wire a plug".
Yeah, that could be job number two. I think it's a sewer.
No, it will turn out well.
How will it?
She's stunted, that's one thing.
We are lost.
Yo, Paulie.
Brett is the name.
He existed. He was some kid I knew from Little League. He was a real jerk. You say he's a friend of Dwayne's?
Here--drop it where they'll find it and return it to him. He's not a bad egg. I'll ship him back the fifty before we arrive.
Oh, my barbaric Ninotchka. My impossible, unromantic, statistical...
Glorious, analytical...
Good choice.
Not thirsty? We've got enough virgin samples to last us the week.
I don't feel too good. I think I'm still drunk from last night.
Never stopped you before. And for God's sake stop plucking your hair. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make sure you wouldn't go bald.
If I were you I'd worry about myself. Haven't you forgotten something?
But no one actually saw him die.
Yeah, I think it is. And I don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids -- It's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... Knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.
Grace told me you have a country house in Connecticut. Sounds like a beautiful place.
Ever think of moving there full time?
C.I.A., Mrs. Lampert. We're an extension of the wartime O.S.S. It was our money and we want it back.
Maybe he really is Dyle. He could still be alive.
We're anxious to know who this man is -- the one calling himself Dyle.
You haven't said anything.
That's the spirit.
Aren't you coming?
What?
Zat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. Hey... Monet!
That's okay I like the metro, it's only a couple of stops from here.
I insist, it is the least we can do.
I'll bet you do, Mr. Felson. I'll just bet you do.
You're very direct, Mr. Felson.
When?
I just got something off the wire. The woman who owns it was murdered last night. Now, I'm not saying I agree with you or nothing, but... what else do you know?
Little place called "Williams," why?
Would you like to come out tonight?
That's right. When?
Just shut up a second and listen... That, uh... that bar in Arizona? Where you said Betty was?
Come on, I have to get this dressing off... it itches! And what about my fish? Who is taking care of them?
That's a nice name for what you need...
Elden, let me out of here. Now! This is ridiculous, I need medical attention!
Until then--the dollar forty stays with me.
--there's thousands of 'em!
But why? Oh, you object to the kind of business I do, huh? But think of all those poor refugees who must rot in this place if I didn't help them. That's not so bad. Through ways of my own I provide them with exit visas.
If I gave you any thought, I probably would.
But think of all the poor devils who cannot meet Renault's price. I get it for them for half. Is that so parasitic?
For a price, Ugarte, for a price.
Well, Rick, after tonight I'll be through with the whole business, and I am leaving finally this Casablanca.
I don't mind a parasite. I object to a cut-rate one.
Myself. I found myself much more reasonable.
Who did you bribe for your visa? Renault or yourself?
One moment. Tonight I'll be selling those for more money than even I have ever dreamed of, and then, addio Casablanca! You know, Rick, I have many friends in Casablanca, but somehow, just because you despise me you're the only one I trust. Will you keep these for me? Please.
Yeah.
Do you still have friends on the force?
I can't handle it. I can't keep my feelings bottled up like you. Can you honestly tell me that you feel nothing for me? ... Tell me!
You know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..
Isn't that a Z140? Alleviated titanium. Neuro charged assault model?
Been here long?
You gotta push the little yellow button...
HA!
I'm sorry I'm late. I was having lunch with Ruth Rabinow's assistant. Guess what? Marylin Rexroth is divorced!
Am I not talking sense? - forgive me, I'm, I've been walking, I've - there's a woman badly injured at Gilf Kebir, in the Cave of Swimmers. I am a member of the Royal Geographical Society.
What?
Well, why'd you shoot him?
We don't know which Buick, do we?
He told us it's in the Buick.
This is great -- just great! Now we don't know where the goddamn stuff is.
That was to get him to talk! Get rid of that thing, will you?
You told me how to do it!
Are you out of your mind? You scalped him!
IT SURE IS!!
See ya at the yard, Meat.
It's not just art, it's history. Something you Americans don't care about--because you haven't got any.
That's because we live in the future. Which is what's on my mind.
Tonight your league night?
Check out my ball.
Doesn't look like much. How come those Commos want it so bad?
"Mas cerveza por favor."
I don't and I don't think you should...
I don't know. Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun.
Look, I'm sorry. You were gone. I just assumed you were off having fun.
But, PG E told her about the chromium?
So what's the story on this thing? This cancer stuff?
So what made you think it was?
If I do it, can we go?
What do you mean?
No tips. I won't give you any tips of any kind.
When you sober up come in and see me.
Thanks, Joe.
Y'know, you're not in England yet, you know that of course, and by the way, I want to just tell you that I lived in England for a few months,
Yeah, I know. I-I can't believe I forgot.
It's okay, Eugene.
No, words. You have never heard words?
They want more money. They are trying to make two days out of it?
Which guy in Toledo are you talking about?
You talkin' to me about Ramada Inn?
I'm a puppeteer.
Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
That's the rumor.
What about your father?
It's more than that.
That's good... that's wonderful. It's wonderful for you.
Oh yeah...
Yeah,, it goes up a little and then it goes down, maybe Nixon will do something. What's the difference, they're all a bunch of jerks. I wouldn't let 'em run my business, I can tell you that much. Not if I had any choice in the matter. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know, I don't know what's right or wrong anymore.
It wasn't smart. Even if you'd gotten away without me --I'd have found you--no matter where you were.
What about Jackie?
You jerk off before all big dates, right? Tell me you jerk off before your big dates.
Think about it: After you've had sex with a girl and the two of you are laying in bed, are you nervous?
No.
Okay, sounds like you're all set. Just clean the pipes and it's a go.
Because I live there.
You know, clean the pipes.
Pipes? What are you talking about?
Your mom and the boys can drop by anytime.
To check up on me?
I'll be around to check up on you.
I'm usually too tired to be.
Can you tell whether an object moved against the head, or the other way around? Or would both look the same.
Hand me the canula.
I'm not myself since I stopped smoking.
Sixteen years ago.
Mean?
Do you want the truth, Anya?
Sure!
You're all right.
May I use your telephone?
You know that I can cook my ass off when I feel like it.
I have hurt you and I am sorry for it.
I am done with theatre. The playhouse is for dreamers. Look where the dream has brought us.
Fifty shillings. Pounds.
Just don't take any course where they make you read Beowulf.
'Cause adult education's a wonderful thing. You meet a lotta interesting professors. You know, it's stimulating.
Hey, don't be ridiculous.
It's-it's got bad plumbing and bugs. Jesus, I'll-My accountant will write it off as a tax deduction, I'll pay for it.
That place is four hundred dollars a month?
So, Ruth. How's Sam?
My whole metabolism is -- off.
Marylin.
-- Ruth Rabinow, this is Rex Rexroth. And you must be Mrs. Rexroth.
Nah, that's okay. My brother has to look up old people's asses all day long. Let's give him a break.
This is Bandit I, come back.
Bandit I, do you copy?
Let me show you something. The secret to opening champagne is that once the cork is released, you keep pressure on it so you don't --
Yeah, well, you should be my agent.
You look fabulous, Mrs. Raymond.
Just a second. Guy's going for 2500.
Three o clock.
My best friend. My very best friend.
What? Oh, yes, please.
Yes, go on.
Well--then it must be my mistake. I beg your pardon.
Um, hi, I'm Ted Peloquin. I'm here to take Mary to the prom.
Hi, Mary.
Oh. Oh, that's a good one.
Just five dollars, please.
Maybe I shouldn't take it.
I taught him to drink beer. He taught me how to fly.
Hey, Frank.
He's just feeling sorry for himself. This is it, pal. Hear me? Two bucks a can.
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
Okay, buddy boy, where ya keepin' Mallory? I know she's still here, and I know you know where. So, start talking or my first work as a director will be your death scene.
You're taking us to that holding cell now. All right, Cut!
She's loyal to her king... it's only to be expected that she...
Ronald?
I thought we should celebrate.
Devastated beyond repair. I doubt she'll ever trust a man again.
You wanted an answer to your question.
I have a flair for drama.
But in order to do so, the church must first prove her heresy, or else you'll be burning a martyr...
What would my being a faggot have to do with that?
Are you referring to me, Madam?
What about this, Burns? Kidnapping, eh?
Oh, trying to frame me, eh! I never saw this woman before in my life!
All right, look. I can make it Right, I can make this up to you, Mattie. I can, I swear.
Did you want to have a cup of coffee or something, Bill?
What question?
Katharine! Oh dear God, Katharine - what are you doing here?
The one in the street. I chased after you.
Are you Annie?
I'm Jonah. That's my dad. His name is Sam.
But I'd do it, I'd get that one Into him. So help me God, I would.
It's freezing my hands.
Uh, it's a deep south expression.
Want to? A million angry octopus people couldn't hold me back!
Could I come with you to getting a Gelati?
But, Elaine --
Could you do it?
I'm sorry I took you in there.
That's funny, Adele. How many more times you gonna gimme that one?
I made their lives better.
No, you don't know what it is. It's not for me. This money's for you, for when you come back from England with honors to set you up, so you don't have to depend on anybody again. Diane, I take better care of these people than their families do. I care for them, I give them flowers, I feed them, I wipe their mouths...
Honey, about what?
How are you today?
I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in "A" ball?
I told you! I've got everything!
What?
How could you?! This is just like home!
Would you like a tranquilizer?
Honey?
Then I don't get anything either.
Do you want something else, honey? We order something else?
Not terrific enough. What were you doing in that part of town? Who were you with?
Yeah, it's like you know every inch of each other's souls -- and then you're free.
OK, OK.
For not being any help?
You're not sore at me?
I got my whole life to drink.
This is great, honey. The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
I'll make it up to you.
Listen, Miss Ladybird, you're here on a rain check and I know it. You're hanging on by your nails. You let that glory whistle blow loud and clear for Eddie and you're a wreck on a railroad track. You're a horse that finished last. So don't make trouble, Miss Ladybird. Live and let live. While you can.
You tell me.
All right. Today for me, tomorrow for himself.
Well, nobody has to sell.
Where's Bert?
Yes!
How'd you know about that?
What?
You're my friend, aren't you?
Listen, ah... We're going to take the Cadillac for a while. How'd that be?
Don't worry, I won't let her drive.
Hi, whatcha doing?
Good a way to kill time as any... She okay?
Did you write that letter to Miss Mitchell?
Go fuck yourself.
Get your hand off me.
I don't see any ladies here. Except maybe you.
Well, ah... that's a personal question.
You don't owe me that.
Who you talkin' to, Studs? Me, or Buddy. I can't tell, you got those shades on.
What's this?
That's what I think of it, Bingy!
Smythe, the - er - gentleman is leaving.
Take care, Paul. It takes a certain kind of courage for you to say that in front of the President of the News Division.
She doesn't leave her room! She has been locked in for the last two days with lawyers and law books!
All right, then make an appointment with her so I can see her!
And Leonitchka! What she said about us...!
And they might believe her in Moscow.
What did she say about me?
I think she covered you with the parasites.
We avoided luxury and extravagance and today... well, if you were to offer us a glass of champagne, we wouldn't say no.
Well, boys, I'd like to help you but what can I do? Yesterday I waited six hours in the lobby!
You do know how to do that, don't you?
OH, and but one word with one of us? Couple it with something. Make it a word and a...a blow.
He didn't mean it nasty. He said that gettin' lost and disappearing from the face of the earth was sometimes a good thing to do-- especially like that.
Crash once called a woman's, uh-- pussy--y'know how the hair kinda makes a "V" shape?--
Well--he calls it the Bermuda Triangle. He said a man can get lost in there and never be heard from again.
I know what it is.
Fundamentals?
Good.
Switch the charts.
I don't mind in the summer -- but on a rainy night -- and I haven't had any dinner yet --
I know, Buddy-boy, I know. But those things don't always run on schedule -- like a Greyhound bus.
Mr. Kirkeby, I don't like to complain -- but you were supposed to be out of here by eight.
You're on your way up, Buddy-boy. And you're practically out of liquor.
That's right. We were discussing our department -- manpower-wise -- and promotion-wise -- -- and I told him what a bright boy you were. They're always on the lookout for young executives. BUD Thank you, Mr. Kirkeby.
Mr. Sheldrake?
Sure, sure. Look, kid -- I put in a good word for you with Sheldrake, in Personnel.
Well, lay in some vodka and some vermouth -- and put my name on it.
I know. Mr. Eichelberger -- in the Mortgage Loan Department -- last night he had a little Halloween party here --
Yeah, sure.
Think about it.
...No.
Hey, ever think about retirin'?
Nothing else.
You took a cab to see three kung fu movies?
Hey.
I didn't say you did.
It's mine to give. I didn't steal it.
Where did you get -- ?
For Jefferson High. For books.
I don't know who this Mr. Dyle is, but it's just possible we were wrong about who killed your husband.
Good night.
Tomorrow at ten at the Prefect's office.
I was having a nightmare.
What time is it?
Alex?
What are you going to see?
Do you have bad dreams, too?
Oh, okay. Here it comes.
Nothing. It's just you're a girl after my own heart.
You see your office?
Too great oppression for a tender thing.
Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
If love be rough with you, be rough with love; Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
Is love a tender thing? It is too rough, Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
Oh, by the way, I think you oughta know -- Lorna thinks she's got the clap.
Lester, it just happened.
She's been acting weird lately, though. I shoulda seen it coming. Babbling on and on and on about "communication". Like I don't know how to communicate.
What's going on?
Exactly.
What would you say if I told you the toilet just blew up in my face.
Well. I'd rather see you get it than the company.
Sure.
Just a minute--Your wife knows her own name, doesn't she?
Oh, yes, I am, because afterwards--up here in the moonlight.
Lula, sometimes I gotta admit, you come up with some weird thoughts...
What do you want from me, Jack? Name it. You want money?
Oh, just traveling through, huh?
How about family? Got any family?
Looks all right
You have more in common than you know.
Don't be deceived, Irene. These are just the clothes. He has to wear them. Something I could never do.
Don't bother him with that. We got to get going.
Whose were they?
I may, I may have to get back into it, 'cause my accountant says that I'm running out of dollars. But...but, um, no, I haven't, I just sort of dropped out for a year...
Don't get yourself all worked up--
No, I liked the way it made me sound. Okay. Be good. So long.
You know what I...
I'm going to miss you -- you're a prick in a great way...
This story they won't cover. And if the network doesn't cover it -- it must not be important so why worry.
No. I don't know how much fun it will be when Martin Klein and Ernie have to drop off their credentials with the security guard.
Certified and everything. Got it right here in my wallet... What? No, he's not here -- I'm in a phone booth.
So long.
Yes? I'm trying.
Well, it's fine. Thank you.
...yes I did...?
What?
Okay, we'll order out.
The 'question' --
Hey, man, you know they have big balloons built into cars?
You watch your mouth when you're in a goddamn county vehicle... You don't think I see what's going on? Del, now this Cooley fella, both of 'em mixed up with Joyce... 'S not no conspiracy, not some episode off the X-Files... 's just a crime of passion, plain and simple. Betty's on some kind'a pre-minstral rampage, that's what is going on here.
Well, do something, then, damnit!
Just plain 'Joe'?
What?
The driver was killed. I think there's a connection --
Yeah. Why, you know him?
I know that...
Come on, Elden, think about it. The driver, all them trunks standing open like that... something's going on here!
You will?
Yeah, Bill, the suspense is killing me.
I know I got you into this, Hildy, but it does seem to me that you can't care much for me if you're willing to let me stay locked up for two hours.
I waited and waited and then I had an idea and wired Albany to send me a hundred dollars so I could get out on bail... I don't know what they'll think -- they sent it to the police station!
For Pete's sake, Hildy, they're waiting for the rest of that story!
Not through any help of yours, Hildy.
But not impossible... Gilles and La Hire are ready to risk everything to save her...
Huh?
What did you call me, boy?
Pardon?
What did you call me?
How're you doing, Sarge?
Hi, son.
I know why most of you are here. We're not stupid. But before you get to sell what we teach you over at United Airlines, you gotta give the Navy six years of your life, Sweet Pea. Lot of things can happen in six year. Another war could come up in six years. If you're too peaceful a person to dump napalm on an enemy village where there might be women and children, I'm gonna find that out. Understand?
I have.
Don't worry.
Keep your voice down.
Before that.
I called you Sarge.
Something better. Open it.
What'cha reading?
It's more than that.
Where are you?
This is outrageous!
Thank you, Your Honor. Are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Your Honor!
A little strange. I can't stop thinking about this girl, Valerie.
You are under oath, Miss Bennett. I ask you again - are you employed by the Morning Mail?
Maybe you love her. But what do I know? I'm baked out of my mind.
We had the greatest afternoon of my life until Adrian made me tell her she had a heart-shaped ass.
I'm out of fuel!
Well, I play the tuba.
No.
Why? It's not dinner time yet.
Sure is.
Tonight?
Let's do it.
Tell me something. What's it like, walk in a bank with a gun, stick it up?
Holy shit, yes!
...Tomorrow we sign off -- photo opportunity, you and Big John, it'll lead network news. Okay so far?
All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
She didn't like me.
A theatre poet?
On your six -- coming hard. Four hundred. Losing airspeed! He's on your six and closing fast! Hard left! HARD LEFT!
I've lost him -- where is he?
Yes sir.
You're father was Marvin Mitchell..
Roberto? How long?
A good man. Good flyer.
Ahhh... Runs in the family, sir.
Maverick... Where'd you get that call sign?
I know. Everybody tells me.
And sit behind a desk? Chairborne?
337-09-9876. But I don't want anyone to know my name.
337.....I'm sorry....
-- and this is confidential?
Can you say that my name is Jack?
Oh, no, no. I am not a highwayman, I'm just a nuisance. All I'm trying to do is make things as difficult as possible.
I suppose you expect us to hand over the jewels?
But how will she look? The fashions this spring are very becoming to her. Gentlemen, the judge will be French, the jury will be French, everybody in that courtroom will be French. Have you ever seen a French court when a beautiful woman sits on the witness stand and lifts her skirt a little? You sit down and pull up your pants and where will it get you?
All right, go ahead, get her on the witness stand! What can she say?
In any case, gentlemen, a charming, beautiful, exquisite woman. I warn you, if this case comes to trial it will be before a French court, and when the Duchess takes the stand...
The former Duchess!
The Duchess...
You think because you represent the former Duchess...
Soviet Russia will put all its might behind this case.
That won't help you! You can't intimidate us!
Look at this! He won't let us leave!
The monkey!! He's everywhere! He'll take over both our lives if we let him.
I'm trying. It's weird, that's all. I never had any good luck, until I met you...what if it's all just another bad dream?
Well... about everything.
Everything about what?
... Everything.
Why? Are they what's most important?
Ah ha. You finally want to know about women.
Mind your own business, Peaches.
One napkin, coming up. I wish we had some champagne to wrap it around.
Just some local Pinot, you know, then a little Burgundy. That old Cotes de Beaune!
Heard you got remarried! Congratulations. Didn't think you had the stomach for another go-round.
Hello?
A little place in Los Olivos. New owners. Cozy ambiance. Excellent food too -- you should try it. Thought of you at the Hitching Post last night.
I just wanted you to know I've decided not to go to the wedding, so in case you were dreading some uncomfortable, you know, run-in or something, well, worry no more. You won't see me there. My wedding gift to you and what's- his-name. What is his name?
I did, didn't I? I distinctly remember bending over and putting it there --
Oh, I found a key there, all right -- only it's the wrong key.
Oh, Buddy-boy. I was just about to call you. I'm sorry about that mess on the living room wall. You see, my little friend, she kept insisting Picasso was a bum -- so she started to do that mural -- but I'm sure it will wash off -- just eyebrow pencil.
It's not Picasso I'm calling about. It's the key -- to my apartment -- you were supposed to leave it under the mat.
Listen to him. Little Lord Fauntleroy!
A lot of guys around here have tried it -- all kinds of approaches -- no dice. What is she trying to prove?
Could be she's just a nice, respectable girl -- there are millions of them.
I'm in your debt, Screwball.
It is? Well, how about that? No wonder I couldn't get into the executive washroom this morning.
And I couldn't get into my apartment -- so at four a. m. I had to wake up the landlady and give her a whole song and dance about going out to mail a letter and the door slamming shut.
They tricked you.
What happened?
Um... no. I don't have a statement at this time.
A statement?
I'll do my best, Mr. Chairman.
Peter Kenneth Appleton. Hollywood, California.
No, marriage is all right for Harry, and Marty, and Sam and you.
You forgot to be there.
Okay?
Stay!
Well, I was just calling to see how you're doing.
How was your date?
Well, I was just calling to tell you I was thinking about you and I miss you. I'll let you go.
No.
Willow, why don't you use your mag- ic to get us out of here?
He turned that monster into stone!
No. I have two. The other one is the one I'm looking for. What's this? It's from my grandmother.
My belt.
Get out.
I'm not leaving this room until you say yes.
Don t you believe in simplicity?
Aren't you?
No, We aren't going to do it.
The way I look at it, I've carried the camel to water and stuffed it's head under - if it doesn't drink now, we might as well shoot the thing and call it a day.
All right, say you're right, say You don't get yourself killed. There's something else. It's too late for Virge, he Already rolled his bone. But it's Not too late for you, Morg.
What're you talkin' about?
Yeah?
Great. Super-fantastic.
Is there a man?
Want me to drive you home later?
Sounds to me like he liked having you around. I'll see you, Karen. Mr. Sisco.
I have to qualify, is that it?
We'll talk another time, Karen. All right? I'd like to know why Foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.
No! You're not dating until your sister starts dating. End of discussion.
Then neither will you. And I'll get to sleep at night.
Enough!
Sit down!
Here's luck to the bride and bridegroom.
You know, Hildy, he's not a bad fellow.
What in the hell for? You think I'm gettin' any at my age? I don't like blue-haired women. I don't like 'em.
You don't like punk rockers?
Say what?
You feeling better?
I feel fine!
That's me, Merv.
Merv, this is the action down at Sunset Cliffs at about six in the morning.
Well, it pretty much speaks for itself. Peter, you want to run with it?
I don't go at all.
School. School is no problem. All you have to do is go to get the grades. And if you know something, all you have to do is go about half the time.
One toy per kid is doing something nice. Four is ... something else.
Don't you get it? They had their 2,000 years. Now it's our turn.
I'd like to do your hair sometime.
Am I what?
If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two.
Hang in there, man.
I came on a bus.
I just had a mental picture of...
Oh, that's nice.
I don't know. Why doesn't it?
So far?
I was in the city.
Because that s where I live.
Look, you don t understand. I woke up here...and this is very strange ...this is not my house...
Oh, umm, yes, this is Dwight Campbell.
Huh?
Yeah?
Right, uhh... I feel terrible about this, we have a prior engagement at another party. But... I'd be honored if you'd come.
What was the color of Tim's belt?
Right. No one. I mean, I'll tell myself sometimes but... don't worry -- I won't believe it.
I do.
I don't know.
I did. We played three games of backgammon and...
--was Wynant's.
What am I? The fall guy?
Ben Gay.
I should go.
I have to. I m the best man.
You're over reacting!
You better take a drink.
Said he stole his invention.
What?
Oh, Shell, that's ridiculous, where are my needle nosed pliers?
Honey, ahh, guys don't wanna appear over anxious, so if you think there's a boy that might like you, let him know that you like him, so he won't feel he's taking such a risk when he's thinking of asking you out.
Yes, lovebirds. We couldn't let you...
After all, you did go to the trouble of bringing up those birds.
Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend. In fact, I've already invited her to dinner tonight.
For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she?
A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco.
I couldn't do it. Not to you.
No, thanks.
Number two is a wider movement a smile goes with that one like this. That means you got a couple of brand new stories about the farmer's daughter.
You think it's simple, huh?
Expert! Going to write a book on it. Called the "Hitch-Hikers Hail."
But the thumb always works. Different ways to do it, though. Depends on how you feel. For instance, number one is a short, jerky movement That shows independence. You don't care if they stop or not. 'Cause you got some money in your pocket, see?
Well, it is simple. It's all in the thumb, see? A lot of people do it
...I'm at least half a bum. Yeah, fightin' is a crazy racket. The roughest part is the mornin' after.
There's something wrong with this yogurt.
Why should you?
So, just 'cause I was born that way... You know, I'm old enough to make a mature decision.
Because I got off to a wrong foot with my own thing, you know. B-b- b-but I need a dramatic change in my life. FATHER You're gonna believe in Jesus Christ?
I know it sounds funny, but I'm gonna try.
Oh! 'Cause you won't exist!
Thank you, sir.
Say, you are nice. You're all right. You'd make a good wife.
Quite so. Quite.
Now I'm sorry. I appreciate your efforts. But I don't need anybody to help me button my pants - I've been buttoning my pants for thirty years all right, and I can button 'em with one hand as a matter of fact.
Nobody seems to want to do anything Why not ask me? Perhaps I can offer a suggestion. Do what about what?
Oh, my marriage to Anne. Now Mrs. Schuyler, we don't want you to go to any trouble about that. We just want the usual blessings, that's all.
Huh... I suppose the idea of a one day trip to Los Angeles doesn t appeal to you...
I d appreciate it if I could use your phone.
Okay.
Los Angeles?
What happened to Mandrake the Magician?
Jesus.
I don't think so. We're celebrating Miles's book deal.
Whatever you girls want. It's on us tonight. Sky's the limit.
Exactement!
No. Entrapment is what cops do to robbers.
And it's not only because the trip's a tough one --
Don't you see? -- Healy lied to us about everything! The landlord said when he got back from Miami he kept talking about falling for some doctor named Mary!
No, its easy.
I see them every morning.
But the first time I saw you was in the elevator.
They have safaris for tourists now. Maybe you can convince your husband.
This is your home. It's not nowhere. And it's not dull.
You're asking a man if he's too tired to talk about himself? You don't get out much, do you?
I'm sorry. That was...
You'll excuse me, gentlemen. Your business is politics. Mine is running a saloon.
Good evening, Mr. Blaine.
You see, Major, you have nothing to worry about Rick.
Perhaps.
Have no fear. This Shoshone Medicine Woman taught me how to make bug repellent tea out of tree root.
For Vienna?
When are you leaving Berlin?
I --
I'll go -- good-bye.
Oh -- yes but -- later.
Cool....So, if we say eight o'clock.
Great....How long will it go for?
Alright!
Hmm, I still owe him.
How did he look?
I'm sorry, I -- I made a mistake. Kid, I'm askin' man to man. I wanna be ya manager.
What? You've gotta be kidding!
You'd better get smart, man. It's time to walk away.
I don't believe that. They're just having a good time, same as us.
Remember what Foley said? His little warning? Those are the girls he was talking about. They're out to marry us any way they can.
I kid you not, Mayo, I am in love. We must've set a new indoor record today. You want to know how many times we did it?
You're joking.
I hope you're right...
...I know I am. Let's just do what we gotta do here, and get the fuck gone.
Maybe you don't appreciate the gravity of this situation. It's bad enough that we don't have what we came here for. It's worse that we don't know where it is. And now this. This was supposed to be my last job. I already put the deposit down on my boat. How can you eat at a time like this? I get nauseous just watching you...
I can eat because I know we didn't kidnap that woman. I can eat because they aren't looking for us. And I can eat 'cause I'm fucking hungry... ...relax. She's gonna end up on a milk carton and that's about it.
We don't. But a '97 Le Sabre'll be easy to find if it's here, town this size... He said he gave his wife some car as a gift, remember?
Mrs. Rogers? I'm Dwight Campbell, with Neighborly Life Insurance. I'm looking for Betty Sizemore.
What can I do?
Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
Is he an enemy?
-- sort of a boyfriend?
I'm hungry, I can't last any longer.
I have to anyway, my mom will be worried.
Think bigger.
Oh, I m hearing you, Alan. That s not the problem. The problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. And I don t care how low on the totem pole I start, I will get it back... So do yourself a favor and don t get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your French country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.
Those were my words, Bill.
See, my problem is, all I have are hundred dollar bills and I need something smaller. Ones, fives, tens. Like that.
I was thinking of selling all the cards.
Oh, that would be wonderful!
Don't pester him, he's had a hard day.
Give me a bottle of beer.
Huh?
Well, you never can tell... I might get a pet.
Me, two hours a week, talking about poetry. This an interrogation Vada?
Because you have hope that you'll get better?
Hello.
Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
Jesus. I'm sorry.
Fine. Get lost.
And you are a son who doesn't love his mother!
Because my mother was dying! But now she's not.
Go ahead. Just make it quick.
Then tell her I'll come by in the morning. We need to talk.
There's this guy. I heard him talking in my apartment. He's one of the eraser guys. And he fell for you when they were erasing you, so he introduced himself the next day as if he were a stranger and now you're dating him.
There's this guy!
Nothing is wrong with you. You're the most wonderful person I've ever met.
He stole a pair of your panties while you were being erased!
I suppose you don't think that's funny?
Two Scotchmen met on the street... and I don't know the name of the street and it really doesn't matter. Well, anyway, one's name was McIntosh and the other's was McGillicuddy. McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "Hello, Mr. McGillicuddy," and McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "Hello, Mr. McIntosh," and then McIntosh says to McGillicuddy, "How is Mrs. McGillicuddy?" and then McGillicuddy says to McIntosh, "How is Mrs. McIntosh?"...
So do I. Now, here's a great one... Ha! Ha! Ha! Well, maybe it's not so good. Let's forget it! How's this? Two men are looking at the moon. One says to the other, "Is it true that a lot of people live on the moon?" "Yes, it is," says the other, "five hundred million." "Whew!" replies the first, "they must get pretty crowded when it's half moon!" Ha! Ha! Ha!
Well, er... let's drop it. I don't think you would care for that one.
Do you like Scotch stories?
What's she doing here?
How ya doin' Miss Evans?
Kim has all this stuff to do, I hardly see her.
Yeah.
I don't know --
It's very hard for him to talk about this stuff. It's like it makes him sadder.
And you crazy? He thinks shows like this are dumb. If you didn't have an 800 number I could never get away with this --
I think that's about the time I fell asleep.
Seriously?
Yeah, she OD'd. But wasn't on her last legs or anythin'. She didn't take too much. It shouldn't have killed her. There was somethin' wrong with what she took.
Keep it down, dude.
I think you need your balls reattached.
Yeah, I think you sounded pretty good.
Hey guys, you came to watch me in action?
I don't want to dupe her, Jessica. If I say it, I have to be sure I mean it.
No, she doesn't, either. You've got tons as well.
Great idea.
"Let all who love me follow me"... Where does God get mentioned? Come on Jeanne, be honest. You fought for yourself, in your name.
Really?
I agree...
No, no, you did fine. I'd even say well done. Besides, most of the ones you killed probably deserved it, don't you think?
Nobody's going to hurt your son...
No, you're the best and I don't want you talking to anybody on the plane.
You know how I feel about you.
Mr. Gazzo says I should get two hundred or break the thumb.
Yeah. That too. I broke up with Avery.
What are you doing!
This is a fine time to be asking that. You're on your way to France.
What's ya name again?
Yeah, we have a van.
Where's it parked?
Sounds great, well you give 'em both one of these for me.
I know, I know, let's go on the quot;sit on the bench and rest quot; ride.
Let's have a look anyway.
I hope you're going to invite me in?
No, not just yet.
Um, nothing, let's go?
No shit? Dick, that's great!
Jesus, are we on the air? Jonah, for God's sake --
If you can't keep up, don't drink yours.
Oh?
How?
It's in the little leaguer who may strike out but knows in his heart that at least swung... Hands to the side...
Dave...
'... It's in the gentle kindness of the family kitchen as we gather together when the sun goes down...'
Dave!
... Somewhere there is a distant light, guiding us through this rocky shoal...'
Thanks, I wrote it.
'America isn't in what we say here tonight -- it's in the faces and the smiles of a Sunday afternoon...' Hand on the heart...
Dave...
What? You make me hot...
Oh yeah, you re a bad girl, baby... You make me so hot...I m gonna take you to that special place...
Not it...?
Oh. Yeah.
Who?
No, no, no. Now that's too much!
Oh, that 'Dukes of Hazzard' show, there was probably ninety-five people there, maybe more.
Well...small world. Well, then, you know firsthand how Hollywood does things. Lights all over the place, generators, a hundred and fifty crew members---
I was on the 'Dukes of Hazzard' set about eight years ago.
That's very nice of you. I don't get many dinner invitations on the job. It would be a welcome change. Thanks.
It sure is.
See what I mean? It's a funny business, isn't it?
Is the dizziness gone?
-- we're kidding ourselves.
-- do you want ice?
-- just before I ask you out? I can't do that. Let's get out of here before good old Les catches up with us again.
Those Arabs won't be when they start chasing you around the sand dunes.
But you knew about this.
Why are people always so happy when they collide with someone from the same place? What happened in Montreal when you passed a man in the street - did you invite him to live with you?
No.
I'm okay. Look, it's a big house. We needn't disturb each other. I can shoot a pistol! I'll sleep in the stables. I don't care where I sleep. I don't sleep.
Fine. I'm not looking.
Why? Can he lay eggs?
Okay, okay...
No.
Home. Watching TV.
Yeah.
All I want is thirty-nine sixty. If you'll give me a check I'll get out of this place. It gives me the jitters.
A whole lot, Frankie.
Like a home, for one thing.
Why not? I'm not charging you for the time I wasted.
What's the matter? Isn't it cheap enough? A trip like that would cost you a thousand dollars!
What ten thousand?
Who said anything about a reward!
With your attitude, Private, I'm surprised you want to stay in the service.
Hi....what....what's up....?
What about for food an' stuff?
Oddly enough, I do.
I guess so.
I don't know.
I don't know. What if it breaks?
Collect.
Send it collect.
Mush. Mush.
Go on. Go on send the telegram.
Don't.
Uhh, Miss devoto, these people are already at ease. This is not a Beauty Parlor, it's a Funeral Parlor.
My kid sister. She just broke up with her boyfriend and she's thinking about dropping out of law school.
Yes, Leon...
Bless you...
I can't.
No! I can't explain now. Oh, look -- the pearls. You wear them now...
Why?
Yeah.
God, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?
About this telegram to Moscow. Why should you bother? I'll write it for you.
April.
February?
A useless talent.
Right. It's incredible how you do that. Remember things.
They were simple songs.
Drove me crazy when we were kids. The way you never looked at the music. Miss Simpson would just play it and ...
I told you. It's a useless talent.
Not for me. I still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? Otherwise, I forget. I just forget. But you. You never forget. Ever. So how come you couldn't remember Ma's birthday?
What proposition?
I just said let's have a little lunch. Room service.
Sure, Mollie, you never looked better in your life.
Naomi.
Oh no--I don't want to impose on you-- It's funny about that billfold--I could have sworn I had it-
She tossed her ring in the pond and bid me fetch it. Said she'd marry me if I did.
Go on... go on...
Have you ever considered piracy? You'd make a wonderful Dread Pirate Roberts.
So?
I don't pretend I came over on the Mayflower--
Just shut up.
I did. But the jury won't s...
Help!
No. Please, don't force him.
Thank you. Verdell... sweetheart? By the way, thanks for saving me.
I called. I never touched you. I didn't leave my name or nothing.
Verdell?
Listen to her! "That's what he's here for"! He's here to loose, that's what he's here for. First of all, I'm unbeatable. Second, how old are you?
Two years younger than you.
Nice to meet you, Betty.
You know, I think it's been five years since I saw you eat anything. That's the God's truth.
Get back in there.
Swim?
It was Jane McKenna who sent you the dumper.
Do you have any idea how much fuckin' coke you got?
I'll keep my eyeballs peeled.
Where the hell are you?
Shut up, Fred.
Tell him we'll be back on the highway in a second.
Oh! Great. That's great!
Well, it was my fault -- the break- up. I'm sorry.
I miss you.
I didn't make you. You thought it best. But, look, I take full responsibility.
It's been a pretty lonely couple of years.
Olympic.
Like a marriage made in heaven?
So... Board convenes tomorrow, you'll recommend, we close and it's a deal, right?
Hi, Jennifer.
Is there something more we should know about this suspect, Sir? I mean besides what's on his sheet.
With respect, Sir, many perfectly innocent citizens have left specimens at as many crime scenes. Maybe he's just unlucky.
You haven't seen Susie, have you?
I'll give you plenty of rings as soon as I get the stones set--what do you think?
Why I'm so lucky. Why I should find you waiting for me to come along.
And I was wondering.
I'm sorry for asking. I forgot we said "no questions."
Uh huh.
OK. I'll stop talking then.
No, ma'am, I'm afraid that's extra.
Relax our center... It's just sitting in a bucket.
You haven't heard the question yet. Truth is, you'd be doing me a favor. I got all these eager young colts need riding and poor old Rimrock here is feeling kind of left out...
I can't believe Will killed him.
Do I know everything there is to know here? You fellas aren't talking with Bob Sugar, are you?
Me?
I don't care what they're forming. I'm on my way and I don't like the idea of being stopped either.
Look, Mr. Norton, I think you've got a lot of nerve having those people hold us here.
Well, if there's nobody holding us here, let's get going. Incidentally, my name isn't Doe. It's Willoughby.
John Doe Clubs? What for?
Yes.
-- stop --
Dinner? Absolutely.
Yeah, I appreciate it. Thanks, Josef.
Honey, I have to ask you this... Is Santos involved in any of this?
I thought this was practically a done deal --
Yep. He really crushed that dinger, didn't he. Musta gone 450 feet...damn...
I can't help how I think. You're trained a certain way when you're a kid and you can't change.
Beat it out and get hold of some guys.
Duffy!!!! Duffy!!!! Well, where is Duffy? Diabetes! I ought to know better than to hire anybody with a disease. Louie.
Butch! I'd put my arm in fire for you -- up to here! Now, you can't double-cross me!... She does? All right -- put her on. I'll talk to her... Hello! Oh, hello, Madam... Now listen, you ten-cent glamour girl, you can't keep Butch away from his duty... What's that? You say that again and I'll come over there and knock your eye out! Hello? I'll kill 'em! I'll kill both of 'em! Duffy! Mousing around with some big blonde Annie on my time! That's co-operation! Duffy!!
Anybody with hair on his chest. Get 'em off the street -- anywhere. Offer them anything -- only get them. We've got to get this desk out of here.
I was merely drawing a parallel, Miss Daniels.
Really!
I see.
Aye! That too.
I am prepared to accept the terms, Mr. Newcombe.
Mr. Newcombe, I have made some difficult loans during the past few years, at very onerous terms, but 18 a year interest seems very stiff indeed.
Yes, of course.
Provided that they can be assured of her ladyship's freewill? Are you serious?
I'll drop a cow on the knave!
I am not left-handed either.
Tell me.
No one of consequence.
Malkovich.
YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR FUCKING MIND!!
We wait.
I think she's about to foal.
We're not dropping it. Now that's the reason, isn't it? I'm a dirty degenerate, aren't I? I'm not fit to --
I'm not good enough for her to associate with, am I? I'm not good enough to even talk about her, am I?
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson. Because I think I know what they are.
Then let's hear them.
They say I'm like Lazarus. You know, the guy who was raised from the dead?!
I'm good enough for you but I'm too slimy to associate with your daughter. That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?
What color flowers you want me to bring to your funeral?
Sorry you're gonna die -- cause I'm gonna make it.
I don't know. I hadn't worked that part out yet. All I knew was that I liked you, and I didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.
Well sure, Colonel --
Why, I--
Really?
Great!
Jeanne's alive!
We have to press home the attack!
I promise...
Auf wiedersehn.
All right--don't spoil the trip with any of those jokes-- there's a nice bunch of people on this trip--nothing but class--I looked over the passenger list and they're all members of the Who's Who!
I would say you're very shy by nature.
I loved him too much.
To hide a black eye.
Why wouldn't she leave?
I'll watch for him, sir.
It'll never hurt you---Got any money?
I'll give you half of it. Here's seventy cents.
Hey. Where's Monkeybone?
Back? You're sending me back?
Death! Thank you!
Oh yeah?--My personality put this thing over--
But it's not true, I feel good with you... It feels right...
I'm not from the sea... I don't understand what you're talking about.
You're an hour and a half late.
Impersonally.
Finch, don't you think it's about time you learned to take a dump at school?
Of course, Finch. What?
What are we gonna hear?
This. Right now.
You're just gonna sit there and drink your coffee?
So what?
You want me to call you a cocksucker?!
It was a cocksucking call!
No! I said It was a cock-sucking call and you can't run me for that!
You spit on me!
What was this desperate urge to see me?
Yeah.
Around.
How many could you handle?
He's with the Prince in the Castle. But the castle gate is guarded by thirty men.
You don't look so good. You don't smell so good either.
True!
Yeah?
Perhaps not. I feel fine.
No. I see the hand of Tremoille, and Regnault, and Yolande, and you... and they are dirty hands.
Tremoille... don't. Please...
What do you fear most now... my sword? ... or his hands?
I didn't mean it that way.
Oh, that's nice.
I can't, I'm sorry. Forgive me.
Look, it's too much of a tangle. I already cast my lot. I can't go Back and I can't sneak, feel back Enough as it is.
Are you going to help me up?
You really scared me, you shithead.
Where are we going?
Yeah.
Well. I'm glad we... WHOAA!!
I'll tell you when we get there.
Mary . . .
That's absurd on the face of it, Mr. Burns! He's talking like a child.
I understand of course. It is to be expected.
Killed last night, in a tavern! Come, then, we'll say a prayer for his soul
I'd want "One Step Beyond" by Madness. And "You Can't Always Get What You Want."
Because it's in The Big Chill.
Haven't seen it.
Liar. We saw it in the Lawrence Kasdan double-bill with Body Heat.
Oh. Right. But I'd forgotten about that. I wasn't biting the idea.
Not really.
No, no. When are you going home?
-- oh -- sweetheart...
You would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand.
-- Otis?
What's wrong, Mary, are you drunk? Look, I've had a rough night, one of the roughest I've ever had, now I'm not in the mood for any sulking bullshit, what's wrong? Are you sick? Are you drunk? Can you work?
-- please, please forgive me...
Ma, I'm gonna stay home and watch Jackie Gleason.
Oh, Thomas. Ma, it's just a big dance hall, and that's all it is. I been there a hundred times. Loaded with tomatoes. Boy, you're funny, Ma.
Ha! Who told you about the Stardust Ballroom?
Sooner or later, there comes a point in a man's life when he gotta face some facts, and one fact I gotta face is that whatever it is that women like, I ain't got it. I chased enough girls in my life. I went to enough dances. I got hurt enough. I don't wanna get hurt no more. I just called a girl just now, and I got a real brush-off, boy. I figured I was past the point of being hurt, but that hurt. Some stupid woman who I didn't even wanna call up. She gave me the brush. I don't wanna go to the Stardust Ballroom because all that ever happened to me there was girls made me feel like I was a bug. I got feelings, you know. I had enough pain. No, thank you.
Ma, when are you gonna give up? You gotta bachelor on your hands. I ain't never gonna get married.
Screwball you know, and many other of the wee folk. We serve as escort for our grand champion, Jack o' the Green.
Twas Jimmy done that, I merely stood for the blame unfairly... but, here now, Ogg, this be no time to rehash old differences, I've friends along in need of safe haven for the night.
Keep going!! Keep going!!
How long do you stay up there before you go?
A day or so.
But, no, you've been doing that all night! You're gonna...you're gonna burn a hole in your... You're gonna develop a third nostril! Really, don't, please.
Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
Good morning, Jennifer.
Oh yeah.
Cool pictures. You a fan?
Kat a fan, too?
Macbeth, right?
Don't give me that shit! I know you're still a virgin!
Are you still a virgin?
I didn't say that.
I did find him!
Good day.
For the time being.
Are you quite finished with us?
I am making out the report now. We haven't quite decided whether he committed suicide or died trying to escape.
Looks like you were in a bad car accident.
What's that?
I'm not, but do you have to point out how stupid everyone is.
That's your full name?
Better safe than sorry.
Get in the boat, Rose.
Well if you don't get to marry Mr. Bixler.
Hi Vada.
What are you doing.
I'm not going... You know that I'm not going... Do you think I could leave you alone here? After that --?
The veronal -- you. I'm going to stay here with you.
You are beautiful!
Beautiful but so sad. I did not know it was so dangerous to look into a woman's bedroom.
That is not the truth. You do not want to be alone -- you're afraid of being alone -- I know you're afraid. I know you. You were desperate, just now, if I go away you'll be more desperate than ever. Say I am to stay with you... say it.
I'm at your service.
Good night!
No, thanks--I'll take a walk around the deck and then turn in--
I don't remember seeing any ponds up there.
Thank you all for your efforts, but I'm afraid we can no longer get into Malkovich through the portal.
A'ight, this time we gotta get the motherfuckin' trajectory right... Okay, on three: One... Two...
I don't trust that chatterbox.
Cause I don't just stick my dick in anything.
Four.
That what you think?
I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
No.
Yes. She had a husband and a son.
Yes.
You've always loved the animals.
What's that?
What?
No they're not.
Listen, he just needs to sleep it off. Someone will take care of him.
Look Mrs Spitz... I don t know to whom I m indebted for the recommendation but... I m not in the business of making oaths of allegiance or giving myself character references. What I do is listen to what the people who care to call me have to say and judge whether or not I can be of help. I hope you can appreciate that, Mrs Spitz.
Spike. For God's sake -- she's in trouble -- get a grip.
Oh, I don't know. I mean look around. Isn't this a fun place?
Well, I like it here.
What can I do about it?
Your brothers are upsetting the balance of good and evil.
I'm sorry. I'm just here to shower.
Really?
He can peddle over anytime he wants to for it.
Hand me a towel. I'm getting out.
Know so.
Yeah. Maybe. I dunno.
Then you get us out of here.
You've been there?
Like what?
In sections! And one other thing, doubting Tom -- it just occurred to me that all the calls Thorwald made were long distance! If he called his wife the day she left -- after she arrived in Merritsville -- why did she need to send him a postcard saying she'd arrived?
Anybody been hurt?
Actually I was trying to catch up on my reading. There's a lot of Dickens I never got around to --
Hostages?
All right, well, good night.
Oh, yeah? What?
And you're in love overnight?
Honey, I gotta start makin' money.
You're welcome. Rose.
Well, here you are.
Uh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead.
That's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out.
That penguin last night, is he one of them?
No noise, no sound, no movement, nothing! Hello, Diane?
Diamond. Yes it is. 56 carats.
I want you. To tell the truth.
Uh... w-we're going back to the Pierre. We're staying at the Pierre... and we're gonna meet Jack and Angelica, and have a drink there, and... if you'd like to come, uh, we'd love to have you.
Maybe. Listen. You wanna know why I chase women? I find women charming.
...of possibly working together.
No, I don't-I don't know, but I-I know your work. I'm a big fan of yours.
Thank you very much. It's a pleasure.
This is, uh, Shawn, and, uh... Bob and Petronia.
I'll remember that. What do you do?
...About five years now.
Well. This'll be over soon. Venza's such a nut job, we're bound to pick him up soon.
Well, T.J.'s... seniority... and all. I'll talk to Garber about it.
What did you watch?
You talked to his wife?
How often does this happen?
No.
I'd say you'd better take her to the nearest psychiatrist, psychologist, neurologist, psychoanalyst, or plain family doctor. And have him check you both.
No.
Huh?
I just couldn't sleep. I got up and went back... and then got up again. These last few days... whew!
No.
Then, after the first number, I tell the one about the Scotchman trying to open a Pullman window--the Scotchman says to the window--"Gee you're tight."-- and the window says--"You loosen up a bit and so will I."--Good?--And then I do the one-- Oh--you don't like it, eh?
It's you.
What for?
There you go again -- you know I didn't mean it that way, Fran. Just get well -- do what the nurse tells you -- I mean Baxter -- and I'll see you as soon as I can. Bye, Fran.
Gas?
I could kill you now.
Siddown, Dick. They're trying to open the safe, not your maid.
Oh, sure.
I told your wife. Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad. And it's real.
Horticulture? Wow. I didn't know there was a college here.
A paper?
Mrnmm, yeah... but not really. It shifts around a lot. Like you also start to see everything from the point of view of the father. And some other stuff happens, some parallel narrative, and then it evolves -- or devolves -- into a kind of a Robbe-Grillet mystery -- you know, with no real resolution.
Um... yeah but it's more...
If your neighbors didn't mind, how'd you get put out of business?
Yes...
You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
Where did you get that?
Baby? Right on time.
Oh baby... oh baby...
Hey Blaine, did I leave my... holy shit.
What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
Why? You can't even lift one.
And break her heart and mine?
It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38.
Same old stuff. I'm watching a man who won three Overseas Press Awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.
You want to go out there -- get out of this for a second?
Why don't you lead? I'll just follow the flurry you cause.
You've made my dreams silly.
How you doing?
Great. Network news, Washington... I love it. What do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?
Keep it to yourself.
You know the other day I really wanted your reaction to how we did with the Libyan report -- I was going to ask but I guess I feel a little intimidated with you.
On the night table.
They pass this picture around you can go anywhere you want, nobody'll know you.
I wasn't feeling my best that day. I'd just drawn thirty to life.
Man, forget you then, stupid.
I think we gotta kiss now.
Baby...
Yeah?
Don't mind the Colonel. He hates people.
Oh, that's 'cause we both play doohickies. I met him in a box car a couple o' years ago. I was foolin' around with my harmonica and he comes over and joins in. I haven't been able to shake him since.
All right, boys, here he is.
But, he's gonna jump off a building!
I don't know.
Thank you, Desmond. What's the reason for your truancy?
Hey! Wait a minute! There's no birthday party for me here!
Food will be eaten on your time! Why are you continuously late for this class, Mr. Spicoli? Why do you shamelessly waste my time like this?
I don't know, mon. The food lines took forever.
You mean, you couldn't? Or you wouldn't?
I couldn't make it in time.
No.
I don't know.
I don't understand.
But Elaine --
Dr. Paley, where were you the last time you saw Miss Lawson?
Get out.
That's awful. The poor woman should be taken care of immediately.
Yes, sir.
If she was his wife, she should have all the money. That's only fair. I don't want a penny of it.
I'm glad to see you're willing to be reasonable, Mr. Deeds.
What kind of wife did you say she was?
I leave it to you, Mr. Deeds. Can you conceive of any court not being in sympathy with any woman who gave up the best years of her life for an old man like your uncle?
A child? My uncle's?
Common-law wife. On top of that, there's a child.
Please, just leave.
You'd better get right down there. That opera mob is about to break into the Mad Song from "Lucia."
Yes, I believe I do.
He didn't fall? Inconceivable!!
The three of us cleaned up and took him to the post and put him under. Can't say I was much help.
And the ten thousand?
Widow's benefits. He figured it would make the disappearance look better, and that Mexican gal was just scrapin' by after Charley killed her man. They didn't get hooked up till late--
Don't think the Rangers are likely to find out any more than they already have.
Word gets out who that body was, people are gonna think Buddy done it.
No pistol. Ever.
You ever handle a pistol like this, Samuel?
You ever miss it?
Okay.
I can't, it's yours.
I am so glad to see you!! I thought I'd never see you again!
Lean on him.
Good God... they're shooting Midge!
Mightier than the sword indeed.
What about Carter?
Wait, are you saying that I don't appreciate?
Ahh, why don't I come in first thing in the morning and you can check out that left blinker for me.
Wha...what do you mean? We have a date every night.
I can't make it.
What?
Yes.
Say it. Scream it. All the way out the front door and into your van. And if you stop screaming, I swear to God I'll blow your head off.
Got it.
He knows something's up.
He saw the wire.
We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
But you already confessed this morning...
Not too sure about that.
Thanks for your help.
There's a charming crowd here tonight, isn't there?
Will you do me a favor? Stop talking about the good old days.
I wanted to give it to you first.
At last I find you.
Please. I said I don't want you to do this.
Yeah.
I... I don't know... it'll sound like we... betrayed her...?
You told me what you could. I guess I'm through with your part of it.
-- wait, just wait --
You'll be able to find your way back, won't you?
I know exactly what I want, Mother.
I know, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself.
Mother?
You'd be doing hair and makeup and answering the phone.
Great, you can start right away. Call me Harry. Now, umm, is this what you'd normally wear for work? Don't get me wrong, I like it, very much, but the....
Pardon?
Oh, You still want it? Even though uhh...
Fuck off.
Then a little nap--
He didn't have one.
Oh. Swiss. His profession?
I'm very confused.
Your husband possessed a ticket of passage on the 'Maranguape.' It sailed from Bordeaux for Maracaibo this morning at seven.
Swiss.
He was American?
I'm very cold.
You loved him?
Leave?
We discovered your husband's body lying next to the tracks of the Paris- Bourdeaux railroad line. He was dressed only in his pajamas. Do you know of any reason why he might have wished to leave France?
Do you suppose it's ethical to watch a man with binoculars, and a long- focus lens -- until you can see the freckles on the back of his neck, and almost read his mail -- do you suppose it's ethical even if you prove he didn't commit a crime?
Yes, sir.
That depends on who "they" were.
The police Department at Merritsville. They called to report. The trunk was just picked up -- by Mrs. Anna Thorwald.
But you continued to fight.
Lawrence is getting derogatory again.
The hard deck for this hop was ten thousand feet. Jester, at what point did you call off the fight?
Is that how you remember it?
I had him in view. I was peeling over the egg, into a dive. He saw me when I moved in for the kill. There wasn't any danger...
Crimson!
Right. In the middle. Of the floor.
Boy!
What?
Once you been up there, you know you been some place!
Oh my God...
What happened?
Yep. You know, my father -- who is a scientist -- says that everything is a miracle. Everything. Until recently I wasn 't sure what he meant by that.
Oh my God... Hello.
A condition...
I will see it next time.
It was yellow.
Well, it's... It's sort of an... an incident' really...
You...
Aw shit...the crowded restaurant... so there's no scene...
Hey, Eve!
No...
And then I saw her. And all I know is, when I looked in her eyes I saw something... light. And life and passion and yearning. And something else I can't even put my finger on, something I'd never seen before--
Murder, uh?
I don't know... I felt like... like I was suffocating... Christ, Zack... I was so scared... so godddamn scared...
Sid, what happened?
It doesn't matter what he's going through. That's the whole purpose of this zoo. What matters is he freaked out for some reason at twenty-five thousand feet and that can't ever happen again.
You didn't kick him out...? Wait, didn't he tell you what he's been going through?
He's right, Zack. It doesn't matter.
But you don't understand. There's this girl he's gotten pregnant and she's putting him through hell, sir.
Just like that it's all over? With less than two weeks to go, you're out?
I would love to come for dinner.
I'm sorry I didn't call sooner, but I just read your note. I stuffed it into my pocket. The light was fading and I had to get my shot.
I got the nurses for fifty grand a piece and the doctors for a hundred. The older one wanted head of the CDC.
Listen, I have to shoot Cedar Bridge until a little after sunset. I want a few night shots. Would you like to come with me? If you're interested...
Okay. See you later.
Uh-uh.
Let it ring.
Nobody can hear it.
You're from Muncie?!
...A Muncie girl! Talk about the cat's pyjamas! Tell you what, Amy. I'm gonna cancel the rest of my appointments this afternoon and get you a job here at the Hud.
One of my few virtues is discretion.
I came here to let you go. 27.
I'm fine. What's up?
You okay?
Gimme a second here... Tidwell... Arizona contract... new glass cabinet...
Damn right.
Marcee, things are changing around here. You and Rod will have my total personal attention.
Not a chance.
Isn't that wonderful! You see, madame--
Oh?
You don't tell Her Majesty how you feel.
Why not?
Yes, ma'am.
Archie.
To the foot doctor.
What you find tonight on the floor between the seats?
Fifty lire...
Somebody stole it.
Does he love you?
I called your room from downstairs.
Stop freaking with her head man. Just stop playing with her mind, you know? She's a human being. She's a person. She's very talented, you know.
Joe. Joe. She's written sixty-five songs. They're all about you. They're all about pain.
How much is your soul worth if you don't?
Party? Oh no, I can t go to a party...
What's eatin' you, Jocko?
Cigarette?
Yes.
Like that Merchant-Ivory clap-trap. All those assholes make are unwatchable movies from unreadable books.
I hear you talkin' Clarence. We park our cars in the same garage.
After five years.
Don't remember that being my fault. Seems like you divorced me same time as your mom.
Look, I'm busy.
I can see that. I know things look pretty bleak right now, but you can't get down on yourself.
What do you want?
Came by to check on you.
Now?
Right. Raymond... a priest.
I stopped taking your advice a long time ago, or did you forget?
No.
You got the right attitude, anyway, look, we gotta talk.
Tear into it, will you? Don't sit there like a frozen robin!
Finished!
You said it! But this'll teach him a lesson. He won't quit his paper without giving notice after this.
Save it.
I don't have one.
-- because I go there all the time. I don't think I ever saw you before.
Really? Because --
The weirder part is I think actually I recognize you. I thought that earlier in the diner. That's why I was looking at you. You work at Borders, right?
I noticed your hair. I guess it made an impression on me, that's why I was pretty sure I recognized you.
...Like I said, I'd make a boss sparrin' mate.
Not a very good one I'm afraid.
I wouldn't take no cheap shots. I'd be a good sparrin' partner.
I guess all the suspects are here.
Sure, an' I'm smart enough to know that no sparrin' partner should take cheap shots at the Champ. He's just there to help condition the man.
Not with those smokestacks it's not.
You don't want to go all the way to San Francisco in a limousine, do you? I don't.
I'll guard them and you with my life.
You talk kind of funny, but I like it.
Dusty's just bought a huge house in Southampton and he's in the process of decorating it.
No, baby. Now look, that girl that called -- I have to talk to her, she'll do something.
No.
So Nilsen had a report on her -- so what. You don't know what the hell was in it?
Catherine told me what was in it.
I'll call you back...
That just hurt a lot.
That means his hands are considered a weapon like a gun or a knife. Am I correct on that point?
She came to me with a wild story about demonic possession.
Lawyers. I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you. It's going to be hard to get over. There will be therapy bills for you.
See? You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time?
Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now...
Undisclosed conflict of interest --
An indictable offense.
I think I'd like to talk to my lawyer --
No lawyers, Drew. We're going to offer you a deal.
And what do I get?
You get not to go to jail.
Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
You have to tell me --
You ever actually read any of this guy's books?
He wrote a great one on Burgundy, and I used to get his newsletter, but then there were doubts about whether he does all his own tasting. Plus a couple of times he declared certain years vintages of the century, and they turned out to be turkeys. Fucker never retracted.
I never told you the reason I was telling you everything for.
What would you say if you found your safe had been robbed?
Those audition tapes I sent out... I've been hired by your network for the Washington bureau. So I'll probably see you at work. Sorry.
Didn't have a father?
Call the police?
You shared it with a dick.
Gibarian. He was here.
Hang in there, buddy, you'll get there.
I know.
Yeah. So you want double condiments on that?
No, no that's fine. So you doing okay?
I'll just say that we had a great night together.
Yeah.
What?
What would you think of a pitcher who wore women's panties?
Can I ask you something?
Yes, but... So, you haven't got a room left?
Clean.
The guy's a Boy Scout, Bob. He declared frequent flyer miles on his income tax return.
No one gets to be Vice President by being that clean.
Clean.
What about the wife?
Of course you wouldn't. The Rembrandt wouldn't fit.
Maybe the thief thought you had something valuable. You are in the business, that's what Roki says.
Sure. I really like Annie.
Surprise. We re pregnant... Yeah...that must ve been...I mean that was very unexpected. But what are you gonna do, right?
Does it hurt? A lot? Good.
Tom.
C'mon, Betty, open up! I got some questions for you about...
Did you talk to Corey?
Yeah, hi. Nice house.
I already apologized.
I thought that's what we were doing -- asking questions.
My mistake. I apologize.
Shut the fuck up.
Hi.
Like what?
Well, maybe he wants to stay here. Do...do you want to stay here?
Absolutely, Buzz, I'm glad he --
No.
Too aggressive?
Is that all? CHARLIE What else do you want?
Um. You.
Well, what you need...what you have to keep looking for...what you want to get is a wingman who can stay up with you. Who can match you move for move. Then you've got something. I'm sorry.
It is combat. Every second counts.
That stuff about the MiG. I was out of line.
You tell me. I remember a lot of things. I remember a garden, plunging down to the sea - the Devil's Chimney we called it - and there was a cottage at the bottom, right on the shore, nothing between you and France.
Or my wife's.
Don't DO that!!
Can I see you tomorrow?
How close?
This is dangerous. I'm sending backup.
You don't call, you don't write.
Yeah yeah yeah. What's the status?
Don't overestimate yourself.
We're letting them slide?
But, Edward...
But I have never seen this before. I am not complete.
If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't you?
Thanks for the lift, Cecil.
Well, son, you're home!
Nine and-a-half years...
Nine and-a-half years ago.
You never came back from the war. We were told you were missing and presumed dead.
You joined up one month to the day after Pearl Harbor. January seventh... nineteen forty-two.
When did I leave?
Oh, this is Andy --
Here -- Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
No thanks.
My job, my rules. We've got a job to do. No mixing business and pleasure.
Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
Sure was.
The way I see it, you have an unparalleled opportunity to become the richest woman in the world.
Let's make a deal. You shut up.
How do you know?
Look. You don't know good. All right?
It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
No offense, but for a person who says she's lived an extra lifetime, you certainly are thick. Money is power.. Money makes people respect you...
It'll be fine.
Why don't you just beg some money off my dad and move into something decent with a real kitchen and a real bathroom?
I don't like it either, but I'm just trying to find horrible secret place to --
I scoured the city for it.
Happy Birthday.
Oh, don't be silly! No! Don't be ridiculous.
Said who? Sugar?
Twelve years.
... It's easy. You go down. You come up. ... Right, Johana?
Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
Stupid yourself.
You're, uh, you're Minnesota Fats, aren't you? You know, uh, they say Minnesota Fats is the best in the country out where I come from.
Oh God, it's major. He's kissing her on the lips. I have to stop this.
Yes?
Should I?
If I let everything that should worry me, worry me, I'd be dead from worry.
Oh, okay.
Where do you come from?
I'd be you.
Hey, hey... Haaa... bad but temporary. The nurses say it's much better than you looked three weeks ago... the hand will come back... they're sure...
Your government always been pretty happy to have that line. The question's just been where to draw it
I better go. You sure you're all right? It's been a pleasure. Sincerely.
Maybe it went. Where Carl went. Over the side.
I think you'd look good in red.
But I can throw it out of the window.
-- these preposterous inventions, would be better suited to the pages of Amazing Tales Magazine. If the editors of the Manhattan Argus see fit to publish the rantings of a disordered mind, perhaps they will see fit to publish this letter! But I doubt it. I most seriously doubt it. As I doubt also that you could find a home at Amazing Tales, a periodical which I have enjoyed for many years. Yours sincerely, et cetera.
While you're out here, Max, I want you to see some of my TV show. And we're invited to a big Christmas party.
Right-well, Santa Claus will have sunstroke.
There's no economic crime, you know, but there's-there's ritual, religious- cult murders, you know, there's wheat- germ killers out here.
Max, there's no crime, there's no mugging.
Did you ahh, love him?
Actually, I do.
Anyway, Victoria's nice.
What are you going to do about it?
What can I do? I'm dead. Debbie's going to go crazy and end the whole thing.
I'll stop him... You stall him.
Welcome, welcome, one and all.
Oh, no!
That what you do?
You telephoned me to meet you. I've been standing on the corner back there -- waiting for you.
Hallo, Peter.
The football stud?
He's from Kansas City. I wouldn't be surprised if he was your rat.
Blaine, if I knew who it was that person wouldn't be alive right now.
Where did you say she's from?
Kansas. Who the hell do I know in Kansas?
Greg McConnell.
Unbelievable. Some fag, no offense -
- none taken -
- wrote a letter to this chick and saying shit about me.
Any ideas who it could be?
Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
You know, most movies that win a lot of Oscars, I can't stand. "Sophie's Choice", "Ordinary People", "Kramer vs. Kramer", "Gandhi". All that stuff is safe, geriatric, coffee-table dog shit.
Hm? Yeah, but it's no good if you haven't got a long face with it.
I dunno. Didn't think about it, really. It was the asking that was the important thing.
Shut up. I'm only trying to explain.
This stuff. Love and marriage. I want to think about something else.
I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.
Fair enough.
What do you mean?
What's it like where I'm going?
No, I got time.
Well... I have to take this over to Debi.
Uh, who gets dropped first?
How come you never talk?
Oh my God! Sorry.
So we got a deal. Four deputies---
Maybe it's better that way.
What?
What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
We should just do it.
What do you mean? Bruce'll be waiting for you in Albany.
Sure.
Where'd you wire him?
Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper -- and being Mrs. Walter Burns.
I can take care of myself.
I lost.
Of course you did. I said a great flyer, not a smart one. You fly reckless. Great instincts. No discipline. That ambush today, you followed your emotions instead of your wingman. Of course you got killed...and well deserved to. It was a really stupid mistake. In battle, it gets people killed.
For the same reason you are.
Oh, you mean the thrill!
It's my own way. It works for me. I don't care about the rest of that stuff.
Then why are you here?
The flying. The fighting. I'd go up there ten times a day to fight. I'd win at least nine of them. That's all I want to do. It's what I do best. I am real good. Just give me the jet.
We're going to do this.
That's true.
Are you alright?
I don't know. It all happened so Fast. If I'd had a chance to Think about it I guess I probably Would've been scared but... Swear To God, Doc, I just don't know.
Never.
I gotta go. We're on borrowed time.
She was murdered by Hanoi Shan on our wedding night.
I wish he was. He's real enough.
Please, Penny. You just gotta trust me now. Okay? And don't panic. Because it's gonna be all right.
We--
Well -- until the policeman whistles again.
You walk right out the door.
There's no risk?
How do you get out of the house?
Always?
What do you say to him?
The important thing for the stability of our rule is to maintain the balance between good and evil. And I don't think any of you are ready for that responsibility yet. You need the wisdom that comes only with the passage of time.
Please. Now tell me. How do you know he won't wake up sometime and follow you.
I mean... tough break.
Such a sweet boy. But after much thought and careful consideration, I've decided that the ruler for the next ten thousand years is going to have to be... me.
This was a very difficult decision, because I have three wonderful sons. I mean, Adrian, so smart, so ruthless. And Cassius, so strong, so tough. And Nicky, so... so...
Don't worry about coming up with anything. It's cool.
Good. That was the plan. We couldn't stand him and George needed help.
Lois will stay with them. Or we can pawn them off on your parents.
What?
Do you remember anything I've said that wasn't negative?
Sooner than the Fall.
Your writing. It's amazing, Josie. You're really talented. And far less depressing than Dorothy Parker.
I'm thinking.
So what are you thinking for college?
That's crazy. I'll get you some applications.
What?
No. We got a picture, though. One of the waitresses had a camera. God, we were just kids. That was something, wasn't it?
People.' You think Streisand, right? Hot that night. Chills. Through the whole audience. I could hardly play.
Hey, will you look at that?
Are you angry at me?
You can have one.
Ready to stomp sod?
We're not getting any younger, right? And my career, well, it's gotten pretty, you know, frustrating. Even with my new manager. Maybe it's time to settle down.
I'm... I'm not the king...
Can I ask how much is this?
I already have.
I don't know if there's anything wrong with me because I don't know how other people are.....Sometimes I cry a lot.....for no reason.
Hello, how are you?
Yes it is.
So... pretend it's not a game.
You don't believe me, see for yourself.
I can look and see.
Well... I don't think that'd work.
I don't think so.
Ninotchka, I love you.
Yes. No. Yes.
My darling.
You don't like it?
Now, let's hear from you . . .
Yep--everybody's having a good time but me--What do you want, Mary?
Vada I wanna ask you a favor, remember you can absolutely say no if you want to.
Well, let's hear the poem--
Uh-huh.
"Surprise!" you were doing a story on me?!
What? Happy? Why? Because it turns out all along that I was allowed to be attracted to you?
Listen, did you impress it on Butch that I want him and his gang here right away? You did? Every minute counts. All right. Duffy's getting old!
Two guys. Now you want me to help you with some big drug deal. Fuck, Clarence, you killed somebody and you're blowin' it off like it don't mean shit.
Goddamnit, Josie! Drop the act. Do you have any idea what I went through every night because of you?! I was attracted to a 17 year old! When I wasn't taking cold showers, I was trying to figure out what the hell I was going to do when I couldn't teach anymore! I thought I was the one being unethical.
Well, we Montoyas have never taken defeat easily. Come along, Fezzik. Bring the body.
Shut up. I'm playing. Oh you won't regret it, young girls don't forget it, lost in their own wilderness ... But it's all so easy--Just try a little tenderness...
I'm trying to thank you.
Club's expanding its roster to finish the season--
Let go of me!
Over here, Deb... in the Smokehouse.
Oh, those. Why do you ask?
You did that deliberately. You knew all along I'd like them. It was a trick.
Ah! My lady! The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you!
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps
No, thank you.
Absolutely.
Call me David.
I'm going through a period of my life where I just can't be around people. I didn't want to wind up abusing anyone.
Don't expect me to be all broken up over poor Drexl. I think he was a fuckin', freeloadin', parasitic scumbag, and he got exactly what he deserved. I got no pity for a mad dog like that. I think I should get a merit badge or somethin'.
Let s go.
Uh-huh. You could ve waited for me inside.
Right now your big friend at the Diplomat is bleeding fast, Martin. He might still possibly survive if attended to soon. And he did cooperate.
I don t know what your problem is, but...
Six weeks ago. He bought a boy of yours.
Am I supposed to know him?
This one came back and was never seen again. I understand Friedman looked after him.
Clients come and go.
Oh... some, two thousand years, or more.
The Japs did it.
When 'we' . . .? You mean, you'd like to have me live here in your house?
We could have the whole left wing? Wouldn't that be nice! Would that be room enough for us?
A deal's a deal.
How'd you do it?
It's about time.
They're in the basement.
Do what?
Get her to act like a human
I have. And chinks to show for it.
We haven't.
Ben -- this whole idea sounds pretty half-baked.
About an hour ago.
Wait a minute. You talked to Elaine this morning?
No -- they don't.
No. Actually -- she doesn't know about us getting married yet.
No. She doesn't know about it.
She doesn't know that you're coming up to Berkeley?
Alright, high level air safety tips. If anything happens, it'll usually be in the first five minutes of the flight, right?
Did I hear something about jewels?
Her oxygen would have run out.
Ed Bailey, you look like you're Just ready to burst. Well call me A fool but I guess I'll just have To call. Cover your ears, darling.
No.
I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
Just get him to stop.
My girlfriend. If she still is...
Kelvin, she'll disintegrate. You don't believe me? Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it. I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
I'm starving...somebody, help.
Nah. I'm not hungry. I'm sorry I didn't call. It was just, you know, hard to get away.
I'm sorry. How was your evening?
What?
Can't you understand me?
Have you got it now?
Should throw a great weight into the balance...
The ferret?
Right.
Make them talk and you got Williams, Pinky!
Come on, Pinky! Give 'em a little third degree.
Close that door. Don't let anybody in or out.
Get out!
You'll ask me to what?
If you've any accusations to make, Hartman, make them in the proper manner. Otherwise, I'll have to ask you to get out.
There's something down there! A bear or something! A god damn monster! Beau coup teeth! Huge, Grande, with yellow eyes, all this hair, it killed Serafine! My God...
No... I...
You smoke Pall Mall?
Well. I'm not going to let that stop me.
Going to run him through the fluoroscope?
Looks okay. I don't see anything.
Mom, we can't let something like this mess up the family.
This is just about money, you know that.
I mean, how many times have you told me yourself to watch out for these ho's?
So you're gonna take the word of some trick over Pop's? He wouldn't lie.
Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
Do you remember his exact words?
Oh, yeah, yeah.
What's that?
Hiya, Marty. Well, it's old home week.
Bless you, darling Darling! Are you mad? You're not Wearing a bustle. How lewd!
Yes. Take your time. I'm fine.
This is the home of an angel.
Don't know. My watch went the way of the car.
Of course. Wow... you look extremely beautiful.
My pleasure, sir.
I can... The question is, can you lie to your ex- husband?
You guessed wrong.
They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
Plato?
I'm here.
Boy, I'm blind as a bat! You got a match? I'm going to break my neck in here. Where are you?
I've got a gun.
I know. Light a match, will you?
That's swell. How are you?
I'm fine.
You think the end of the world will come at nighttime, Jim?
No. At dawn.
The door was open.
What?
I wouldn't let Adam or Ryan see you doing it.
Dale wants to know if we should run an outside outlet for Christmas lights with a switch inside?
Absolutely. Have him put it on a separate line. At Christmas, we'll pact it so full of lights, we'll make God wear sunglasses.
Why not? I give 'em a great show--and you know-- We're doing capacity, Sally--and all Nice people--
Right. We felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...
No.
Do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?
Get the inkling, Sam. I'm getting tired of your attitude.
I know.
I know.
Ok.
I know.
I won't.
It bugs me.
Why?
Your brothers are right. It was the most god-awful smell I've ever had my nose around.
You snore at night. That bugs me. Can I take you out?
I've moved into Scotty's... Good news about T.J., though. Looks like that tough son of a gun is gonna pull through.
Are you okay?
Oh that thing in Queens.
Where?
When can I see you?
Jesus, Patrick!
She was beautiful. So sweet and funky and voluptuous. I kind of stole a pair of her panties, is what.
She was unconscious, Patrick.
I gotta tell you something. I kind of fell in love with her last night.
--and I can tell you where to get off.
We take off our hat and coat. We sit down -- we make ourselves comfortable. We adjust ourselves to the prospect of a most enjoyable evening. We look at each other. We smile. Well... we don't smile. How about some music?
Well, may I offer you a drink, or how about something to eat?
Go to bed.
It helps. It has ever since King David wooed Bathsheba with the harp. As I am not so fortunate as to have my harp at hand, I shall turn on the radio.
Yeah. Good food. You've got quite a wine collection. Very impressive.
I don't believe you have "things."
Well. Well. Well. Look who made bail!
I don't know. Maybe I should grab my mace. I'm a civil attorney. I have little experience with "the criminal mind."
What do you want?
It was ten days till the wedding. The King still lived, but Buttercup's nightmares were growing steadily worse.
Yeah, you can. You could just quit. People do it all the time.
Bon voyage.
Oh, no--I played with your cards--in your cabin--at your suggestion--If you've got a kick coming, make it to the Purser.
Any bit in particular?
On a Sauvignon Blanc?
Ahm right, right, I liked the bit in space very much. Did you enjoy making that bit?
Huh... I have no... ... hard evidence...
Moreover, the possibility of the successful termination of negotiations now pending with the Manchester Cotton Company...
A man? -- To Switzerland? -- That must have been nice -- for him.
Moreover... He was a lucky man -- that man.
Don't misunderstand me. I'm a married man -- with grownup daughters. Uh --
With the same friend?
Look. I'm happy to entertain you, as always, but I have a question for you. Are we really "friends?"
Every glass high to life -- the splendid, dangerous, mighty, brief -- brief life -- and the courage to live it. Baron, you know -- I've only lived since last night -- but that little while seems longer than all the time before -- all the --
Shut up! Where s your wallet?
Okay?
But I don't play anything.
Good, I love swinging a shovel.
No, why?
Yeah, that was Honza's idea, I had to buy him a few beers in return for the gear.
You mind your own business! She's an old friend of mine and I like her--what're you going to do about it?
Well, excuse me for askin', Milt, But isn't it kinda dead in here?
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
What is wrong with me?
Her portrait?
No.
Very much.
Aye.
Maybe we could get together some time and talk about it.
No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter Street -- and I've been getting to some classes --
Here? In Berkeley?
Oh.
Oh. Your mother -- well, of course, that relieves my mind.
Madame, let me ask you: Who is M'sieu Laval, anyhow? Where does he come from? What is he?
I'm sorry, madame, but there are still certain matters which I think you should attend to yourself. And I, personally, would not care to refer them to--to--
I take out the garbage.
Your friends use the pool. Your friends messed it up.
Mom says to clean up the pool.
Sorry to keep you waiting so long. Those opera people are funny. They wanted me to put up 180,000.
Oh - we'll have to do something about the common wife.
No, I mean - about my client.
You know what Paris is saying about the Countess Falconier and her chauffeur?
You're coming here?
What are you on about?
Um-hum ...
Mrs. Peterson.
So we'll get egg nog.
Jersey? You know what the traffic's gonna be like?
I've got plenty of places to go.
If it's something you feel strongly about.
I don't know.
This is about her negative attention, not mine. Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?
You're the Tribune man?
This way.
Fine. Have a seat.
Is that the fish you won at the carnival?
He's getting big. Vada, come here and sit down for a minute.
Vada, something happened to Thomas J last night, he stepped on a beehive.
No sweetheart, you can't.
He was allergic to bees.
Yeah, I like that! Where you go, I follow.
Fully. I like her. She has wit.
How did you know?
They're kind of fuzzy.
No kidding.
Could be, I guess.
Well, I have things to do --
How come you're alone on New Year's Eve?
That's right, Mr. Sheldrake. I won't be needing it -- because I'm all washed up around here.
But this is the key to the executive washroom.
Just following doctor's orders. I've decided to become a mensch. You know what that means? A human being.
What's gotten into you, Baxter?
Save it. The old payola won't work any more. Goodbye, Mr. Sheldrake.
Now hold on, Baxter --
Sure, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- we're having a little party and we ran out of ice -- so I was wondering --
I asked you a question, you're writing a tract, h...
Greedy.
He didn't want to lose any more.
This is a great house, really. Everything. Saunas, Jacuzzis, three tennis courts. You know who the original owners were? Nelson Eddy, then Legs Diamond. Then you know who lived here?
Your line of work. You must meet a lot of men play fast and loose with the truth.
Both pilots!
You can have it to use. Why-why are you smiling?
Charlie Chaplin.
Waring Hudsucker! Na-ha-ha-ha-ha! Say, buddy!
Just the same, Wynant wouldn't mind having him out of the way, would he? How long should you say this body'd been here, Doc?
You did miss --
Dad...
Edward, we've been together ten years.
And I don't like what we've become. I'll cover any losses you have on this one. Now get out, you asshole!
You broke my nose.
I think I broke my hand. You're fired.
...What's your pleasure, buddy?
Forty-fourth floor, and it's very --
It's just Pearl Harbor. People are a little crazy, right n...
Yes.
You heard from Reggie?
Told ya I would. You still riled?
Ain't never had no girl pull a blade on me.
I said that the file is incomplete.
That's too easy! Every time I beat a record there's always some dumbshit asking me: "D'you know that French guy, Mayol? He's supposed to be very good! Too bad he doesn't compete." So, you're going to come with me to Taormina! First, because you're my friend and second, because you don't have one reason to keep on spoiling my pleasure. ... I'll see you there...
How so?
In every way.
I had no thought of offending you, Oona.
That was in jest.
Uh --
It's difficult because you're sellin' it to a particular group. Big shots. Fat cats. Guys who can use that kind of quantity. Guys who can afford two hundred thousand. Basically, guys I don't know. You don't know. And, more important, they don't know you. I did talk with one guy who could possibly help you.
That's why you got the gig, isn't it?
They were fucking called that before I was in it, okay? It wasn't my idea.
What band?
You are not in a band, Barry. You are not a musician. And no posters.
The band that found me and asked me to join.
Barrytown. Barrytown? Is there no end to your arrogance?
Thanks for your support, Rob. Really appreciate it.
You can't be called Barry and sing in a group called Barrytown.
The 'coffee shop' --
I - uh --
Sure...
Then that's our play. But we're still going to need some insurance. Come on.
Well?
Affliction is enamoured of thy parts, and thou art wedded to calamity. Hence from Verona art thou banished. Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
There is no world without Verona walls, hence banished is banished from the world and worlds exile is death. Then banished is death mis-termed. Calling death banished, thou cu'st my head off with a golden axe and smiles upon the stroke that murders me.
Sissy, Sissy, blushing bride, you can desist from wearing paths in those forgotten highways. The Countess has arranged a job for you. And what a job...
You were the Yoni Yum girl from, let's see, from nineteen sixty-eight through nineteen seventy. You've always smelled so nice. Like a little sister. The irony has just killed me. You, the Dew Girl, one of the few girls who doesn't need Dew. I loath the stink of females! They are so sweet the way God made them, then they start fooling around with men and soon they're stinking. Like rotten mushrooms, like an excessively chlorinated swimming pool, like a tuna fish's retirement party. They all stink. From the Queen of England to Bonanza Jellybean, they stink.
Shit O goodness, you won't be thirty for another year, and you're more beautiful than ever.
No, that's my sister Margaret's husband, Frank. My sister Margaret, she's married to the insurance salesman, and my sister Rose, she married a contractor. They moved to Detroit last year. And my other sister Frances, she got married about two and a half years ago in Saint John's Church on Kingsbridge Avenue. Oh, that was a big affair. Well, let's see now, that'll be about a dollar- seventy-nine. How's that with you?
That's right, Missus Fusari. It was a very nice affair.
No, that's my other brother, Freddie. My other brother Freddie, he's been married four years already. He lives down on Webb Avenue. The one who got married Sunday, that was my little brother, Nickie.
Missus Fusari, Missus Canduso over there, she's inna big hurry, and...
Oh, come on -- tell us another.
You're almost there, you can do it -- can do -- can do.
Shit, shit, shit...
What do you mean, it changes?
Maybe your marriage should lay off grains for a while.
Mr. Burns --
You seem to know all about my destiny.
I wonder if you do. I wonder if you know that you're trying to escape from yourself and that you'll never succeed.
You love her that much?
I know a good deal more about you than you suspect. I know, for instance, that you are in love with a woman. It is perhaps strange that we both should be in love with the same woman. The first evening I came here in this cafe, I knew there was something between you and Ilsa. Since no one is to blame, I, I demand no explanation. I ask only one thing. You won't give me the letters of transit. All right. But I want my wife to be safe. I ask you as a favor to use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.
Apparently you think of me only as the leader of a cause. Well, I am also a human being.
Scratched -- We did not take the initiative.
Well -- gentlemen.
Tell me about Doctor Paley?
You mind if I try? You have to slam the door in my face? I try to get to him--what happens? Don't I give you everything you want? A bicycle--you get a bicycle. A car--
You buy me many things. Thank you.
Not just buy! You hear all this talk about not lovely your kids enough. We give you love and affection, don't we?
Let me just explain to you--we just moved here, y'understand? The kid has no friends yet and--
Tell him why we moved here.
Hold it, Jim.
You can't protect me.
Was it because we went to that party? You know what kind of drunken brawls those parties turn into-- it's no place for kids.
You got weird kids, Frank.
She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
They don't. They're always asking about you.
Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
You're their uncle.
She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
It was an accident.
It's going to be hard to convince a jury that he's testifying against you in a murder trial because you blew him off.
That way, huh?
It's ok.
Yeah.
What I know is that as long as you keep your work zipped up around me, I don't give a fuck what or where you shove your show. Are we being neighbors for now?
Simon, you've got to get dressed.
Definitely a package you don't want to open or touch.
Hope you find him. I love that dog.
Yes -- I feel I must apologize to everyone for my behavior for the last six months. I have, as you know, been slightly down in the mouth.
Any more announcements?
Well, yes. Groovy.
Wait a minute -- I'm your brother and I don't know anything about this.
Looks like somebody took a dump in it, that's the worst color job I've --
What does he direct besides traffic?
It was just a joke. I was pushing the arrow. I wanted to get to the next question. I wanted to find out who was gonna win the Series.
What great aunt?
Ashamed? No -- I love you, Lynette. I mean that. After I leave them, I'll meet you at the motel, okay?
Old Building and Loan pal, huh . . .
Now you just turn this way and go right straight down.
No, I didn't mean that -- whatever that means. I mean, you just don't look young enough.
You can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. It's unseemly.
Oh, stop it.
You have the job you have...
I'm not buying into any of that. I have a load to learn. I'm not going to act as if...
Okay. Pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?
Shut up a second...
And the rule was...
I made one rule for myself when this started and I realized I was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...
Can you name all the members of the Cabinet?
Never to pretend to know more than I did.
Oh -- no. I'm just sort of disturbed about things.
That's right.
Is what a girl?
What?
What am I a headshrinker? Maybe the man was unhappy.
How is Studsy? I didn't know he was out of stir.
Listen. "Studsy" Burke told me you used to be O.K. That's why I'm here. Do they....
Why tell me?
I haven't seen her in three months. We were all washed up.
That's all swell. Only you're peddling your fish in the wrong market. I've got nothing to do with it.
I wouldn't have any reason to hurt her. She was always on the up and up with me. But that dirty little Nunheim -- he got sore cause I clicked with her and he didn't, so he put the finger on me.
All right - you didn't.
I didn't knock Julia off.
Magic.
Yes. A different wife.
This - what's it called? - this place, I love it - this is mine! I'm asking the King permission to call it the Almasy Bosphorous.
Madox knows, I think. He's tried to warn me. He keeps talking about Anna Karenina. I think it's his idea of a man-to-man chat. Its my idea of a man-to-man chat.
It's a long song - Szerelem means love and the story - there's a Hungarian Count, he's a wanderer, a fool. For years he's on some kind of quest, who knows what? And then one day he falls under the spell of a mysterious English woman - a harpy - who beats him and hits him and he becomes her slave. He sews her clothes, he worships the hem of -
Ouch! See - you're always beating me..!
Again?
Oh, several things.
You see, the bag has just been found, and the reaction of relief from her former excitement and strain is just a little too much for her. It's not very serious, but just the same we'd better not take any chances.
We'll see which way the wind blows.
Come on, let's go.
Hi Vada.
Sure.
Look on the back. What do you see?
Damn, I knew I forgot something.
That's what you're buying. Put it in your pocket.
Aye, but will they?
Don't be embarrassed, madame. I'll take it. I need the money. I wish I were in a position to ignore the whole matter. But you know, madame, the stock market, bank crash ... To make a long story short--a member of the nouveaux poor.
Wow and wow. You have a date, after this?
Fine. But we're not going to let you do your job. Because we're gonna do it. And then, after we do your job, we're gonna do another little job...
I was just kidding.
No--Inexperienced-- A red-headed kid--homemade clothes--Broadway was Paradise--and a slot at the Automat was a Banquet.
I see. And are you in touch with Mrs. Sizemore?
I see. Did Chloe testify?
He thinks you're being a little careless. He made the point several times.
Oh... Yes... I don't have it with me. It's at home.
I'm supposed to call in.
Right. That's true.
What're you trying to do? Wake up the whole goddamn hotel?
We were just having a little discussion about morality.
Yes! And you don't even know where you're going!
No. Nobody will find us.
Yes... a little white house.
You want me to go in there?
All right, we'll make it red.
To the pools. Now she's Miss Rock Climber, and I'm more the Non-Rock Climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and I have the ring in my pocket, and I'm a little nervous, I'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this -- "Hurry up, klutz."
Mmm, I don't know if you remember me, but we had the worst night of my life together.
Get out.
Get out
Yes, you do recall, right?
I don't know, honey.
Emily Dickinson.
Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
Don't lie to me, motherfucker. You apparently think I'm the dumbest motherfucker in the world! Don't you? Say: Clarence, you are without a doubt, the dumbest motherfucker in the whole wide world. Say it!
Right now?
Right. Here's eighty cents. Send it.
What's your name?
Jack, don't!
The foulest. Mayhap I can cut them free.
Foul fellow, this Couer de Noir.
Aye. He's enchanted the lot of them. His reward for delivering the unicorn.
Blackheart?
This is ogre's magic.
I was just thinking what Ma would think.
I didn't get her number.
What's the matter?
That's not true.
Nothing.
You won't do that.
I know the feeling.
I like how it feels not to feel.
I know. Why?
I took some of your Vicodin.
What are you now?
What I'm not.
What would you like to be?
How do you become something you're not?
Met him through Santos... Clyde - your daddy - had some sorta business deal with Santos.
You upset with me?
And your gun.
Well there.... What's the difference?
Young lady, you're drunk!
Something like that. But I'm sorry it ended like this -- tossed off a train like a sack of third-class mail.
Come on. You can't stay here.
I'm a simultaneous translator -- like Sylvie, only she's English to French -- I'm French to English. That's what I did before I married Charles. The police probably think I killed him.
Instant divorce you mean?
Try and get my old job back at UNESCO, I suppose.
Doing what?
Charles sold it all -- at auction.
Do you know what you're going to do?
Where did everything go?
Thank you, Jennyhaydn. You are good. I must go alone now.
No deal.
I'm afraid we can't let you go.
If I talk to you, I will miss my ship.
Hold on a minute... Let's take the chance, George.
No, they won't.
Arf... You gotta help me.
Which way did he go?
Don't tell anybody.
No way, mon. When I graduate U.S. history I ain't even coming over to your side of the building.
247 home runs in the minors would be a dubious honor, if ya think about it.
That's my job too.
You're pulling your hips out.
No. Please.
Please, don't you realize? She is dying.
I keep hearing it and I don't know what to do..I don't know what to do... .
Are you the Buljanoff who fought on the barricades? And now you are afraid to take a room with a bath?
I think I've made my point with you tonight.
Constantinople?
Hi.
So how did Stephanie know it was Saturday? We didn't get into that with Gary.
Huh. Let me think.
Yeah.
I'm going to need an operation. Maybe a couple of them. They have to wait for it it to heal first. Then they break it again.
Good thing you have a voice-over career.
Gonna fuck that up too. I should sue her ass. Only reason I won't is to protect Christine.
That's thoughtful.
I don't want to hurt Charley I don't want to hurt you...
I know what you want me to do!
A literary feud. Quite normal.
How does it work?
Whatever his name is, that actor.
Thank you.
What do you wanna watch? We've got crap, crap, crap or crap
That must have been quite a disappointment, Mrs. Mussburger.
Oh, yeah... probably...
We think so.
Yes.
Exactly. A condition.
It's actually kind of serious, Dave. I'm afraid the President's not in very good shape.
Oh my gosh...
Will he be alright?
Can you wake up Loretta? I need to talk to her.
Then you go to the left. There's a landing.
How's this for a solution. We'll take a drive over to his place, you can introduce yourself....
... Fine. I ll go for the safe place.
You found my car?!
Uh, I'm fine. Just wanted to let you know I'll have your car back in a couple hours, I'm still staking out this girl's apartment.
Call you back.
I've hired you to help me start a war. That's a prestigious line of work with a long and glorious tradition.
Well, remember when Frysal's men paid off the Deejay in Cairo to announce a bogus press conference in the --
There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
You should come into the shelter.
Look over there.
See what's happening to them - the stars.
In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
Listen to me! Is there any way I can warn her what Monkeybone is up to??
No, thank you.
Many, many days and nights...
You want the baby to laugh at me.
My career is shot.
There.
I didn't ask you to come away with me--
Eight. Eight O' clock.
It's the only way it makes sense.
All right. When is a plate of bean soup not a plate of noodle soup?
On my mother's side the Ardens
She had a cottage. One day, she was three months gone with child, so
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford. A cold bed too, since the twins were born. Banishment was a blessing.
Where's the doctor -- the undertakers?
There is -- I've seen things through that window! Bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope -- and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! Now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!
Lisa, please!
It's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?
Who said it was my first time?
It's okay. I didn't think you were.
Yeah.
I'm not a stalker.
Well, I probably wouldn't say if I were, but no.
I'm not sorry for what I said.
That was quite a show you gave them today. We shoulda sold tickets.
Cigarette?
No, of course not, why should you be sorry? You're the new Peter Appleton. You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that. Very noble.
I like to read.
Finch, listen -- Stifler slipped some sort of laxative in your Mocash-chino or whatever. It's fast acting. I mean really fast.
I'll get you some quick work --
Good deal, man.
Two weeks and three days.
Examination! M'sieu Laval, what are you insinuating? I have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. How long have you enjoyed Madame's confidence? Three weeks, I believe.
And you, M'sieu Giron, seem to be disturbing my examination of this report.
No wine.
Now give the signal.
I have been in love with you for so long.
I...I'm-I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. I have to talk to you for... There's so much that I want to tell you.
Lee! Lee! Lee, I'm in love with you.
With respect, Sir--it may be the only unaccountable specimen but the profile suggests--
Thank you. We'll all keep that in mind. 'Bye now.
He's gonna hurt you, Debbie. He'll never be true to you the way I would.
Thanks, Dad. Cole, go away.
Huh? Wha...
Oh... I got something for that.
...But the word "yet..." Yeah, you know what, I'd get the impression that you wanted to see it. Otherwise you'd say you didn't really want to.
Fine by me. I still want pay to 7 o'clock.
Let's pack it up. We haven't had a customer in four hours.
They found the safe.
Not one this big.
That's Luke. He doesn't like strangers.
You don't say.
I thought I was the English.
Some young page was boasting about having seen it. Lucky.
Yeah, she's got a great-lookin' fa- A pat on the androgynous side. But it's...
I'm cool.
Yeah, and gradually you get old and die. You know it's important to make a little effort once in a while.
Let's see. Those are the flaps, that's the thrust, this must turn on the landing lights.
Don't think about it, Toto. Don't even try. With feelings, there's nothing to understand.
But why? There must be some way to make her understand!
I told you, the blue-eyed ones are the most difficult.
The Treasury Department asked my cooperation in his undercover investigation of John Bontecou. They were convinced that Bontecou, on past deals, had structured his mergers and acquisitions in sus- picious and complicated ways so as to evade paying the taxes he is liable for. The IRS wanted to go after him, and this deal offered them the opportunity. I agreed to cooperate.
If I marry you my mother will die.
She wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.
Loretta, I can't marry you.
I'm sure she did.
You told me that part already.
This better be worth 1t.
I'd say she's a size 6 who wears a size 4.
What the hell!!!
Don't say that!
Do you know I wasn't even supposed to be in Rome? My boss was supposed to come to this conference, and at the last minute he got the measles. The measles. Who gets the measles at forty-three? So they sent me. And I wasn't supposed to be in that piazza that night either. I'd gone to the movies, only it was sold out. So I was wandering around. Just wandering... When I got hit in the head with this shoe.
Who's being selfish now? I'm the one getting married. I thought this week was supposed to be about me.
Okay. All right. And what do I say?
Romeo and Juliet. I cried at the end.
Yes! Lying is always a very effective dating tool.
Okay. Thank you, my friends.
Move your shoulders down.
But, madame, you keep a hundred thousand francs--in your safe--at home?
They were using M-1's, yeah--
This is the stuff we picked up the other day, right? The rest of this is all .30 caliber--
What's the matter? Ya don't like the room?
Mikey--
What--it's a bullet. I'm lousy with bullets here.
Mikey look at this--
Why?
Yes.
Message -- What message?
Nothing's wrong. I think I found something. I was snooping around Tex's room and I found this in the waste basket. I've stuck it back together.
No, it's all right. What's wrong, Adam?
Look kind o' natural, don't they, Fred?
A sight for sore eyes!
I hope Jean-Louis understands about last night -- it's just not safe for him to be around me right now.
Because I have to!
Huh. I d have thought a tough guy like you would know better. The sick ones are out there, friend. They make up the client le. Get rid of them and we re out of business.
Mikey--
Her parents acted like I was gonna blow my nose on their curtains--
Priscilla says they think any woman over 30 who isn't married must be a lesbian. She figures they'll be so relieved I'm a man--
Always heartwarming to see a prejudice defeated by a deeper prejudice. But marriage, man--I did two tours in Southeast Asia and I was married for five years--I couldn't tell you which experience was worse.
Hey, Mikey--
I knew she was Japanese going into it, but she didn't tell me the ninja assassin part--
I think it's beyond what you'd call dating.
Maybe.
You met her family? They gonna be cool about you being a white guy?
Does that bum have to say that?
I WANT MY FATHER BACK, YOU SON- OFA-BITCH!
I know.
I would like to.
I swear. I don t have a signature move.
That ain't my idea of friendliness.
Then why do you want to talk about it?
You're not interested in art?
Art. Well what do you want to know about it.
Are you interested more in modern art or more in classical art.
Yes I do. I know quite a bit about it.
Oh.
There s a guy on 81st and Madison. You get your results in 24 hours. Do you make your lovers get tested before you sleep with them?
How's school?
Don't do that...Sooner or later you'll be left empty-handed.
Toto, this isn't for you. For the moment, the Cinema Paradiso needs you, and you need the Cinema Paradiso. But it won't last...Some day you'll have other things to do, more important things... That's right, more important. I know it. Now that I've lost my sight I see more. I see everything I didn't see before... And it's all thanks to you, who saved my life. And I'll never forget it... And don't put on that look. I haven't gone off my head yet. You want proof?
Why? What do you mean?
Ah, yes, I forgot... God sent us an illiterate peasant to carry out such an important mission! Do you think that God made the right decision, to take an ignorant girl to save the kingdom of France?
Don t stop asking questions, okay?
That is not what is written in the evidence... look for yourself!
Where are you headed?
Oh, yes! You live near here, don't you?
How about you?
The girl?
Who are you?
I brought the girl remember?
There's not a moment to lose! Wake her up, but be gentle about it! This woman is mankind's most precious possession! She is... perfect!
So you do know her.
He's a she!
You noticed...
Uh yes, we're cousins..distant cousins..
It's thirty feet.
I'll see what's going on.
Shhh! Be quiet, man! We're not alone -
Which is everyone you couldn't get in.
I disappear. It s not about me.
The mirror -- it's broken.
Huh?... Eh... no, there isn't
"D.W.R." That case you worked on... the guy who threatened to kill Wynant... what what was his name?
You're not a permanent part of her life. You're a distraction.
Tell him you're afraid of love. Afraid of needing.
Lucky thing for us they weren't in that lime.
You don't miss much.
Nadia, I can't --
Uh...
Um...okay...
Romeo
Right.
I put the diamond in my coat pocket. And I put my coat... on her.
When I have fifty pounds.
I am still owed money for this play, Burbage.
Romeo. Wit, swordsman, lover.
A comedy. All but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.
So that pudding was bought, I bought that pudding because of a pretty interesting promotion that's sponsored by Healthy Choice and American Airlines. It's designed to encourage airline travel and obviously designed to encourage buying Healthy Choice products. They make frozen meals, deli meats, pasta sauce, breads, soups and ice creams, this sort of thing.....
You like her?
How long have you known her?
That's nice. It's nice. I've been looking around a lot lately at promotional giveaways, cross promotional work by some companies. Do you remember all that pudding?
Did you really come to meet me on purpose or are you lying about that?
Why?
Well -- I'm not the guy who's going to run. I stick.
Tell me -- let me help --
What --
Well, I took you across my knee and I started spanking you.
What old mill? Is that somewhere we --
No, not that bad. It was a fella that sends you flowers every day. Er, what's his name? Mr. Norton's nephew.
Yeah, that's the one.
But here's the funniest part of it all. I was the fella up there doing the marrying. You know, the Justice of the Peace or something . . .
Well, yes, I was. But I was your father then, see? But the real me, John Doe, er, that is, Long John Willoughby, I was the fellow up there with the book. You know what I mean?
All right, then, an ordinary matter. I'm a quite well off man, I have a -- position to respect. I would feel personally uncomfortable to be connected with a -- certain kind of woman, I'm sure you understand. Do you? Well I'd like to buy Jane McKenna's book.
-- We can talk --
Can't we talk together reasonably, just -- ordinarily? I know you're expecting some kind of -- extravagant behavior, but believe me -- do you believe me? --
You're right. I better use two.
Have a look. At nothing.
It's on the twine, too. But it's not r...
You stayed after all.
Be a friend. Leave.
Forget it. Just get out of here.
You want me to fuck you? Is that it? Okay, come here. Take your clothes off. Get into bed.
They all know you?
I'm starving.
Romeo will answer it?
...No.
Any man that can write may answer a letter.
I ve got this bad taste in my mouth. What is it? I think it s the words: morally repugnant.
The what?
I burnt down the Chemistry building.
I'd have liked to talk to him.
Why?
Why, what is Tybalt?
I dunno. I guess I'm just stupid.
More than prince of cats. He is the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as you sing prick- song, keeps time, distance, and proportion; he rests his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very first house, of the first and second cause: the immortal passado! punto reverso! the hai!
They know. It's the scent. We Better split 'em up.
I got whiskey here.
Was someone rude to you?
But she isn't due for an hour, sir.
An hour? What's an hour! You know how time flies, Walter. My tie? Get it.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir. Here it is right here, sir. There, sir.
Just as I suspected, wise guy! I don't mind you making a sap out of yourself - but you made one out of me, too.
Will you tell the gentleman I'm not in?
Mary Dawson, huh? Mary Dawson, my eye. That dame took you for a sleigh ride that New York will laugh about for years. She's the slickest, two- timing, double-crossing
She's the star reporter on The Mail. Every time you opened your kisser, you gave her another story. She's the dame who slapped that monicker on you - "Cinderella Man." You've been making love to a double dose of cyanide!
Shut up!
Ho Ho, Capital Punks!
I don't have any.
Do you love Drew?
When you put your mouth to his, Susan, it seems a frequent thing.
I'm sorry. Do you live here?
I guess what I'm trying to say is -- I'd like us to be friends.
I deny your Grace's accusations, and beg you to say how you have been cheated?
I suppose you know what you're doing, but I wonder if you realize what this means?
The cards are now my only livelihood. Sometimes I am in luck, and then I lay out my money in these trinkets you see. It's property, look you, and the only way I have found of keeping a little about me. When the luck goes against me, why, my dear, my diamonds go to the pawnbrokers and I wear paste. Do you understand the cards?
I can play as soldiers do, but have no great skill.
-- Not so fast, Louis. Nobody's going to be arrested. Not for a while yet.
Have you taken leave of your senses?
I have. Sit down over there.
Put that gun down.
Bianca Stratford. Sophomore. Don't even think about it
Why not?
I could start with your haircut, but it doesn't matter. She's not allowed to date until her older sister does. And that's an impossibility.
No kidding.
Nope. Just filling in the blanks.
He left with Sophie.
It's true. She swept him out the door whispering little French things into his ear.
What are you going to do? Go over to her place and kick in the door?
I don't think so.
Oh, I forgot.
Okay. So what's your name today?
I got my things over at the hotel. I'll bring them over later... Come here.
Well, what do you want to know? And why?
Where you been all day?
See you next week!
Yeah, but it's got to be by Bone- Setter Brown.
Well, that's fine. Now I want you to sign this agreement. It gives us an exclusive story under your name day by day from now until Christmas. On December twenty-sixth, you get one railroad ticket out of town, and the Bulletin agrees to pay to have your arm fixed. That's what you want, isn't it?
Well, okay. But we don't want more than a couple o' hundred people in on this thing. Now the first thing I want is an exact copy of the John Doe letter in your own handwriting.
Oh, you trust him, eh? Well, that's fine. I suppose he trusts you, too?
And where're you going?
Yeah, Boss?
Do you use drugs, Ms. Tramell?
But you said you liked men to use their hands.
Writing a book about it gives you an alibi for not killing him.
That's true. Why is that?
You think so?
Yeah. What's that?
I heard you, I heard you.
Then say it.
Reggie -- listen to me --
Never mind -- I'll go by myself.
A billion people speak Chinese. Don't be too impressed with yourself. As for that scroll, I can resell it for double. In 30 minutes.
If Casanova suddenly ... turned out to be Romeo ... having supper with Juliet--who might become Cleopatra ... How would you start?
You give me your permission to kill Johnnie Farragut.
On one condition...
Do you want to get a drink first?
Call me... Ishmael?
I... no, I... I just can't...
It's possible. I just don't remember.
Thanks.
Through the forehead?
Marry Christmas.
Your luck's not with you now!
Roger. And I'll get that other key.
What gave you that idea?
Does it? You forget the power that always watches over the Morning Post.
That wraps it up -- Tex has the money. Go back to bed -- I'll let you know when I've found him.
There's no time -- I'll call you in the morning.
If the police find him first they're not very likely to turn over a quarter of a million dollars to us, are they?
Adam --
Aiding an escaped criminal! And a little charge of kidnapping I'm looking into. But that's the jail! There must be somebody there!
Oh shit... No...
What?!
All right, all right. Here, give Daddy the flower. I'll give it a drink.
Wait now. Where do you think you're going?
There it is, good as new.
Yeah, all right. Now, I'll paste this together.
Those are dreams.
Meaning Man can do whatever the fuck it wants?
That's fantastic.
No... He is supposed to live there?
NEVER!
Then it must've been love --
I dare you. Stab my flesh. Which one of us will bleed?
Tomorrow, we'll cut out your tongue.
All the lawyers in the world aren't going to help you!
Yeah, uh, I'm gonna give him one more year and then I'm goin' to Lourdes.
I never forgot that.
No, of course not, Lois. You just get carried away sometimes. Believe me, I understand --
Who ????
How could you win a crazy bet like --
But it's my new tape. My Monday morning tape. I made it last night just for today.
Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier.
Don't you want to hear what's next?
What's next?
Play it.
Say it.
"Little Latin Lupe Lu."
Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
No. The Righteous Brothers.
Oh well. Nevermind.
Now what's he know about garbage, huh?
I have something to tell you. But I must talk to you alone.
Too bad!
I don't know. Let's just go and... we'll see...
Sorsha.
Can I really believe you this time, Adam?
Reggie -- trust me once more -- please.
You lied to me so many times --
Reggie -- listen to me!
Don't be a fool! He's Carson Dyle!
He's -- with the C.I.A. -- I've seen him at the Embassy.
This is where I proposed.
Whatta you get outta this?
...I'm doin' it for a friend.
What do you mean you made it all up?
We could start a two-person stock company. If things get tough we can play some small town auditoriums. We'll call this one "The Great Deception."
That's my trick!
After that "The Three Musketeers." I'd make a great D'Artagnan.
No mushy stuff. I'm running this troupe.
Yes. Sure.
I see. I'd better stick to running the paper, huh?
Well, I'm stuck with two and two but I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it. Where do you come in?
Look, D. B. I'm supposed to know my way around. This John Doe movement costs you a fortune. This convention's gonna cost plenty.
I'm sorry?
Blanche.
Right.
Okay. I'll meet you at the dock in ten minutes.
There's no such thing.
I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint?
Oh. Sorry, Andrew. Valerie?
Wouldn't be here if I hadn't.
Yellow Room where they dance --
Yes? -- Tomorrow?
Unfortunately no -- to bad -- tomorrow though.
Shall we say five o'clock -- downstairs?
Really?
The night clerk has already gone -- you are late.
Why don't you start with that?
Chaos.
Why do you think they let us in on the "deal"?
Do you think you've been discriminated against on this post?
Any serious problems with your sergeant or your fellow soldiers?
Me too...Hey...if it gets dull a little before 11:00, drop by the studio.
Yes.
Well I'll hand it to you.
Come to the railing and I'll hand it up.
Mrs. Robinson?
Well here's the purse.
I have to go now. I'm sorry.
Where is it?
Hey, have you seen Pearl Harbor at night?
He wants to talk ya.
I wanna be able to announce this deal at Cannes. If I had time for a courtship, Lee, I would. I'd take ya out, I'd hold your hand, I'd kiss you on the cheek at the door. But, I'm not in that position. I need to know if we're in bed together, or not. If you want my movie, Lee, you're just gonna have to come to terms with your Fear and Desire.
Well, then, what's the hurry? Is it true the rights to "Doctor Zhivago" are in arbitration?
No problems on both counts.
He says Wednesday at three o'clock at the Beverly Wilshire. He wants everybody there. He'll talk to you. If after talkin' to you he's convinced you're OK, he'll do business. If not, he'll say fuck it and walk out the door. He also wants a sample bag.
Mr. Donowitz? I told you, through Dick. He's in my acting class. About a year. Yeah, he's good. They grew up together. Sure thing.
With pleasure at finding the ribbon.
What?
The zoo? Is he rational?
Is he all right? Why didn't you call me? Where was he?
Have you read the papers today? Have you listened to the radio or television?
All right, I did, but I was in a weird place then.
...Not until I get a little something to remember you by.
Oh, Mary, honey, you're taking this all wrong. I'm not leaving...
Who the hell's Woogie?
Yup. That s why you get to keep your money.
That s a big one for me, too.
Your pay check is a disgrace to pay checks.
Now...I don t...
Uh... it's the end of October.
Odbody . . . A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
Hey Sherman. Scopin' the babes.
You've got something going?
Feels like warm apple pie, dude.
Apple pie... McDonald's or homemade?
Nothing, nothing at all.
Can I ask that when you clean your hands you wipe the ink off the inside of the sink before it stains the stainless steel.
They're putting me on film tomorrow.
... First time in my life I'll be a voice with a body. Do you know what that means? What this could lead to?
It is my fault! I'm responsible for her!
Did you hear what I said?!!
Goddamn Venza assaulted a taxi driver in the Bronx, thirteen months ago. It's coming to court and the judge let him walk because of the pending case law.
Take it easy! I set her up. I saw it coming.
We're not going to the game, are we Mom?
Yesterday.
It s been my experience that the people who hire a prostitute, need a prostitute. You did the right thing.
You don't have to do this.
I'm not good company. I should be alone.
No.
I want it back.
Now, please, Swana.
You believe in our cause?
On the contrary -- I don't want to have anything to do with them.
Are you sympathetic to the former Czaristic government -- the White Russians?
Confess what?
Hello.
It's stopped snowing out, hasn't it? What's happened here? Come on, soon as these clothes of ours are dry . . .
I can't fly. I haven't got any wings.
You haven't got your wings. Yeah, that's right.
You have no car.
Can it be that you want your brother found?
Take care, okay? You're my entire client roster.
What if you don't wanna be found?
Yes, I suppose you would.
I'll have to get lessons. It wouldn't be much use without them.
Well Baines the music lover, I never would have known. Hidden talents George.
Yes, I thought that.
Roger in Op Ed. Don't make me send you another memo about my policy on inter-office dating.
So. You and Roger in Op Ed.
Just passin' through on my way to who knows where...
You saved a lot of lives, you should be very proud.
I think I know my son.
You, Zack?
Now, let me tell you--
Well, sir, I'm an excellent filer.
Here's Judy Garland!
Stay forever.
Oh. Right. Won't you have a seat?
I told you we know each other, baby. Mr. Massey represented my ex-brother- in law. Martin Reiser?
But they'll put me in jail.
Maude, do you think you can help me?
Good idea of yours to come out here, Harold. It's a lovely spot.
Yes, sir.
Aw, he's some old fart holyman who lives in the hills out West. Gives my ranch the creeps and the willies, too. But though he be old and dirty, he's alive, I'll bet, clear down to his toes. They don't have his juice in a jar in New Haven. Well I suppose that I'll have to write Sissy out on the road.
Chink's the guy's name, for Christ's sake.
I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law. Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
You think I'm crazy.
What was your horse's name?
For instance?
I think you saw something -- that probably has a very simple explanation.
She -- was -- an -- invalid!
His wife took a trip.
All right -- you don't believe me.
You told me. I've got to run, Jeff.
Thanks.
I -- uh -- won't report it to the Department. Let me poke into a little on my own. No point in you getting any ridiculous publicity.
Do that.
We know the wife is gone. I'll see if I can find out where.
What about tonight then, are you going to that party at Valhere's?
About what?
They don't scare me any more.
You're looking great, baby.
Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.
You owe me an' are supposed to treat me good!
Get away from me -- I could never even get married 'cause you couldn't live by yaself -- ya'd die by yaself! So instead I put you two together -- Did ya think of puttin' in a good word for me? -- You owe me!
You a virgin? -- Ya let 'im in ya pants, didn't ya! Ya pulled down ya pants an' let him have it, didn't ya!!
You busted?!
Job.
Gotta go.
Funny job.
Yes, he was.
It's the way it happened, I know it is.
Put this on!
What is it?
What's tira misu?
This is going to be tougher than I thought.
Some woman is going to want me to do it to her and I'm not going to know what it is.
I think they're getting the hang of it! When we re-enlist I'll teach them baseball!
A lot of people made plans before the war. Like George Zipp.
Well, I'll see ya.
Mary ah, forget it.
-- Love story of our time.
Wow. I thought I was the only one.
Hmmm . . .
Sure Sam Wainwright.
Yes. Sam's crazy about Mary.
That's right--here's the eighty cents for you. I'd rather see you get it than the company--send it right off.
Hand it over. Basic plot?
Yes, I have --
But I just -- Look -- what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?
Of course he does. But he might get the wrong idea. Anyone might.
But they would! Don't you see?
True love. You heard him. You could not ask for a more noble cause than that.
So what's up?
Exactly.
Ya know, I used to fuckin' hate airports.
Yeah. Well -- we'll let the blindfolded lady with the scales decide that.
I accept.
I have a suggestion...
Then why are you compulsively eating? If you're not hysterical?
We're about to find out.
Look at it this way, however bad I feel, it isn't as bad as becoming extinct in a bottomless pit of tar.
And that s when he peed in his pants? After the tart?
Dumbfuck Glenn was right, there's about five million worth in there, wouldn't you say, Richard?
You know what I should do with you? I should sock you right in that funny little nose.
Excuse me, Gallagher. I wouldn't miss this one for the world.
Sure, sure. That's all right. That was a great story, Bingy. A great story - wish I'd printed it.
Well, then put him at the singles table.
They look like plain old rocks.
Life is changing you, Mr. Kringelein.
You know something, lady, if you sold life insurance, I'd go for a policy in sixty seconds.
No? Why not?
Decent? Why Miss Schuyler, I want to be noble.
All right, two thousand.
I'll tell you something, Annie -- I stood there looking at what was happening to that horse... And, I swear, it felt like the same thing was happening to me.
I'm not just talking about sex.
And frog don't fly and bite like tomcats. It be magic, Jack... powerful ogre's magic.
There isn't much time!
Lisa Fremont.
Right now I'd even welcome trouble.
How can you tell that from a thermometer!
Don't you ever heat that stuff up.
May I have a suggestion?
Fuck you, Clementine.
Pink. There was a number on it. I remember. AL 1718? I have to follow through with this. I have no choice.
I might be making a mistake.
The driver waved. So casual, friendly.
It was snowing.
I can t tell you that yet. But he s being well looked after.
I believed her: the Dumper was not Tom Grunemann.
Look, Mrs De Moraes, however much of a let down it might be, your brother s not back to his old weekend tricks! Impressionable as he is, he probably grew tired of healthy girls in grisly poses, tried moving on to bigger things, came upon more than he d bargained for and somehow fancied he could take on the real world. Which he no doubt chanced upon on his way to that thing now sitting on your table... Have a look at it, Mrs De Moraes. I told you I had bad news...
All right, suppose it wasn't Tom Grunemann; where does that get you?
So, what's your point?
She wouldn't be reliable anyhow -- a narcotics addict.
I believed her, Pete.
I don't want anyone else ever to have you.
Oh, my God.
This is not an easy situation.
Let's fill it with confitures, des prunes...
...des petites fraises des bois... de la cr me de Bretagne...
...des raisins de Mad re, des framboises...
Comrades... I'm out of the omelet.
And the surprise is there's nothing in it.
...so it blows up that big... what they call an Omelette Surprise!
What's your favorite color?
Your mother will be down in a few minutes, Judy--
Geller, this is way out of your league.
The Queen will be riding to St. George's on the fifth.
Part adventure...part miracle.
I've been sittin' in the church.
Uncle Terrence?
Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
Sort of...
Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
I went to St. Severin church. Now look -
Mine say stuff like "Lloyd, see you around maybe"
Mr. Gayle, do you have the slightest idea how dangerous Knox is?
Mr. Wurlitzer, I assure you, I am very familiar with Mickey Knox's career.
One...I can take care of myself. I grew up in a tough neighbourhood, and I've handled some pretty rough customers in my day. Mickey Knox doesn't scare me. Two...I'm a journalist, and I'm prepared to take that risk. Three...it ain't gonna happen. Believe me when I tell you, it is in Mickey Knox's own best interest to play this game according to Hoyle. Wait a minute. We've gotten into a advisory relationship here, which is not what I want. But seriously, Phil, look at this.
What are we talking about?
Sure. Men cook. We don't all eat bananas with our feet, ya know.
My name's John Klute.
Yeah? Say, you're sold on the John Doe idea, aren't you?
Sure.
Yeah, you bet!
Listen, pal this fifth column stuff's pretty rotten, isn't it?
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell, 'cause he's been marvelous about the John Doe Clubs.
He's coming.
C'mon. I want to know.
Okay.
Mission accomplished.
What about Ian?
What it was like.
What crap?
No...
I figured you'd get to the good stuff eventually.
Thank God! If I had to hear one more story about your coiffure...
The "real you".
Let her go.
I have to, Valerie.
The plumber's due out on Friday.
You were the only neighbor I could tolerate.
My life is a warning. I just can't figure out for what.
His father is a man.
She makes me stretch! I got inside my character last night like I haven't done in six years on "Reason". It was a totally rejuvenating experience.
That part in the movie where they get shot? Warren Beatty and... I can't think of her name.
You're full of interesting facts, aren't you?
A rosary for Mama, a dress for
Jeez, I didn't catch it.
Guilty as charged. I'm not gonna play games with you. I could give you a song and dance but what's the point? I did it and we all know it. The hitcher himself told me it's illegal. The irony...
Isn't that just my luck -- I get caught for everything.
Big O was always there with a smile or a loan or a free drink.
"Hey, Delmore, where's your Daddy?"
Dad--?
Dad, I talked to the track coach--
Okay.
Ain't you goin' to say something?
Thank you for everything.
The man that marks them is an artist--two hundred and fifty bucks for six decks--and they're worth it.
Thank you.
Can't hardly tell. Don't swallow the blood -- Go for his ribs. Don't let 'im breathe.
Don't play with this man, he's fightin' hard -- Let 'em feel some real heat!
You know what a hurry we're in.
I will go. But not you.
If I don't meet the ship, my people will go home without me.
I don't want you to be hurt.
There never will be, you know, unless you actually clean your clothes.
Whoopsidaisies.
Your Honor
Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
I run a temp agency.
Cows. You know, cows?
I guess.
You mean when I'm not running the country?
Home of the brave.
Okay. Good night.
I'll see you at the office. Good night.
Well, can I at least call you deer? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Seriously, Amy, the whole thing is what your beatnik friends call 'karma' -- the great circle of life, death and rebirth.
What?
So what you doin' with a cat like me in a joint like this?
Have the car painted.
So can I.
You asked for something dramatically different! You got it!
Swell. I get myself half-killed for you -- and you reward me by stealing my assignments.
Stop sounding stuffy. I'll take pictures from a jeep. From a water buffalo if necessary.
Okay. When do I leave? Half-hour? An hour?
Didn't I tell you! Didn't I tell you it was the next place to watch?
All right. I've done it. Now, are you satisfied?
What do you do on the other days?
Give me a minute, talk to Buddy.
You got two minutes, that's all. Make up your mind.
Uh... I-I-I know. I deserve this.
I've never read it. I just -- Every time I see one I buy it. I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
Never heard of him.
Damn...
Is he dead yet?
Absolutely.
Sure thing.
Thanks for the advise, sir.
But how can I do that?
I've tried to change her mind.
And in a theater full of empty seats, why did you sit by me?
All in good time.
Captain Oveur, your navigator, Mr. Unger, and your first officer, Mr. Dunn.
What's the story behind you takin' a cab to the most dangerous part of town alone?
People change in relation to each other. Love changes on its own.
That has no place in this house.
Is the English dead?
Sure. But that's only when the love itself goes unchanged.
Looks dead...
You know about this stuff?
Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.
Here's a man says he's looking for you girls.
All right. I'll be in the physics lab. Make it four thirty. I have a rocket club meeting.
Then don't come sneakin' around a man's camp.
So did I. They were in it.
Edie I I never said this to a girl before, I never knew a girl worth trying to say it for, but you you're... .
What's the matter? I've got something That's chokin' me. I've gotta get it out.
From your mouth.
What?
You's the novelty, Champ!
If Laszlo and the cause mean so much to you, you won't stop at anything. All right, I'll make it easier for you.
No.
I don't have to. I've got them right here.
Not that I'm glad you were sick, but I had a chance to do some thinking last night.
Why? I like spending time with you. You know, you're quite attractive for a woman your age. You have killer legs. Killer.
Don't be insecure, Doc. You're a big help.
Let me tell you something, doctor. Chicks love a guy with a bad rap. They say they don't, but they don't mean it. They all think that they're the ones that are going to "save me." The trick is to let them think it's true.
Same time next week?
It works a little.
Everybody thought I'd gone crazy. The cops, my mom, everybody. But you see, they all missed the point of the story. I wasn't crazy. But when I was holding the shotgun, it all became clear. I realized for the first time my one true calling in life. I'm a natural born killer.
Don't make this a joke, Rafe. You're talking about war, and I know what war does to people.
You going to sleep here, all by yourself?
I can't screw. I can't screw.
Yeah, sure. Good luck.
What was all that?
We didn't tell him any different for years --
Mom, great. But what I want is for me to be proud of me.
He's only pretending, to teach her a lesson -- only -- only he is dead, Peter -- I saw him -- he's not pretending. Somebody threw him off a train. What am I going to do?
No.
Like what, sir?
You know, I been thinkin' - how 'bout us gettin' married?
I'm shocked. With a child bearing body like yours... ... why a man would have to be out of his mind!
This food's delicious. You're a wonderful cook. And you have a lovely home.
Well talk back. He won't bite you.
No --
It was. It was.
Well... everything. It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now.
Let him alone.
Yeah, maybe.
Is Johnny here?
That s right. Imagine facing it alone.
This happened to you?
That road can be a bad one at night, Melanie.
Yeah, but she'll be hitting all that traffic going back to San Francisco.
Look, Norman, I'm not the shampoo girl.
Hey you're little, aren't you?
Like what?
Here take mine.
Hello?
Destroying a glass is one thing..killing people with the weapons you produce is quite another.
They are robots!
A single room or a double room?
A room. I'd like a room, please.
Yes sir?
Where is it?
We don't have to do it that way. We can catch him this time.
What's all this for?
Shermin...
Hello George.
You will have this baby. If you want it. If you don't, I can stop it now.
Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais. As you were captured in my diocese, the duty of conducting the trial falls upon me.
Well, either we're gonna hit the hay or get married. Now you don't want to hit the hay, and I don' want to get married.
Since I can remember, Ma'am.
All right, so I'm primitive. So what d'you want with me?
I can't read, Ma'am. I just look at the pictures.
I have a wonderful new play!
Take his feet out. Where will you get
I don't know.
That's not mine it's one of the guys that works here. That pudding's not mine.
That must be nice. That must be really, really, really great.
Yes. LENA Elizabeth has a picture of you guys -- your sisters and you, it's a lot of family, it must be nice.
Do you have brothers or sisters?
It's ok. That's ok. How long have you worked with Elizabeth?
What?
What? No you're not..
Well, Nadia, It it's all the same to you, I'd like to give it a bash.
Ah, a philosopher.
No you're not. How... Nice one. How dumb do you think I am ?
Well, okay. Thank you very much.
I've been up country, you know my summer place, my camp. I don't even have a telephone there. This morning they sent a messenger out, that you'd been trying to call me.
So I'll see you this weekend.
Sure you're okay to drive this?
Okay, honey, I'll see you later.
I'd better go. I gotta get up early. Go over to my parents'.
Oh, right. Alright.
I'm sure it isn't.
Whiskey.
I use it but I don't understand it when other people use it.
I'm going to marry the woman I love.
I don't care what people say.
At a funeral.
I don't want to rush you. Take a couple of seconds.
Well, if she looked like you -- Say! My brains and your looks -- that mightn't be such a bad combination.
How was I leading you on?
Buzz... off! Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Sorry I'm late, Sid. That back nine at Riverdale is really murder.
We don't crawl at Hudsucker Industries! Get out of my office! Leave your uniform in the locker room!
I'm sorry, buddy... I'm sorry...
Get up!
I understand if ya don't like the Buzz-Sucker! Just lemme keep my job, I'm prayin' to ya!
And don't call me buddy! Out of here! Out!
Aw, please, sir -- this job, it's all I got!
Sure, sure, it's a tough course. Well thanks for coming, kid. I thought the board room would be a swell place to chat undisturbed -- it seems we're having some security problems here at the Hud.
Ya don't say.
Repeat the words again, and I run you through the body.
Oh, I thought you was gonna go to work with all them muscles.
Joe and I have no secrets from each other.
Who are they?
Then why did I bother bringin' it up? 'Cause I'm dumb, that's why... Y'know, I think we make a real sharp coupla coconuts -- I'm dumb an' you're shy.
Ya gotta be a little soft to wanna be a pug... It's a racket where ya' almost guaranteed to end up a bum.
Why?
After a rough fight, ya' nothin' but a large wound. Sometimes I feel like callin' a taxi to drive me from my bed to the bathroom... Ya' eyes hurt, ya' ears hurt, ya' hair even hurts... But the thing I'm proud of is I been in over sixty fights an' never had a busted nose -- Bent an' twisted an' bitten but never broke... That's rare.
...Guess.
Have you come from my brother?
You finding lots of cactus and shit?
It's got to be tiring to beat that machine.
Why not?
Sure.
You don't remember.
Well now it's undone, okay? Forget Bontecou! Scrub him! I'm tired of his fancy name and his fancy offer. I'm not going for it.
Sad and wonderful! I have a blue velvet cap which will do well, I have seen apothecary with a cap just so.
No, there. There's a good one. Do you like that?
Will you, Judy?
When was that?
I don't need your charity. I don't need your grandmother's jewelry or your parents money - how could you do that?
That's me. I've been ionized, but I'm okay. I'm, switching on the homing beacon, mark two minute intervals.
The deuce you say. That crate!
I think I'm on to something. You and the guys go back to the house and dig up everything you can on an outfit called Yoyodyne.
No, I'm an actor.
I finished it.
You want to join us?
The Bijou?
Sshhhh!
People have worked this whole big thing up around my father. If it's built on a crime, they deserve to know. Now I understand why you might want to believe he couldn't do it.
And I understand why you might want to think he could.
My abode... My domicile... My neck of the woods... Hungry? Breakfast? A fruit pie perhaps?
No... thanks... Listen --
My name is Parry.
Hi... Where are my shoes?
They're -- -- What?
What!?
What?!
We'll speak soon.
That's just another part of the price to pay.
You got nice tits.
Put your shoulders back, I said.
Are you going to provide me with an opportunity to prove my love to my girl? Or are you gonna save yourself some trouble and step up like a gentleman and apologize to her?
This is a snakeskin jacket, and for me it's a symbol of my individuality and my belief in personal freedom.
" thou need'st not to be gone."
That's pretty good . . . Well, shut my big nasty mouth!
You were wearing your belt.
That's great if you're a computer. In the real world that pane weighs 200 pounds. The building's 600 feet high.
Love you, man.
Back at you.
Hey, don't pull away till they see the car.
Yeah. Hey, why wasn't I injured?
Why don't you come in?
Uh-uh. You're on your own.
So I'll see you at the rehearsal.
Yeah.
You can bring them with a word.
I can play the piano?
That was beautiful.
You were...overjoyed yourself, to hear the news?
She's with me.
Sure. This girl said...
Well, I understand the problem about the supermarkets, but I was talking to this girl last night, and she made the point that a likeable personality is a valuable business asset.
Yes! You shall. Of course you shall --
Something to make the angels weep, and the Saints to gasp for air...
Go on, child.
-- who'll whisper it to Bouchon --
How do these work I wonder? I got- ta save one to show the High Aldwin.
You did. Well... thank you.
Sorry about your friend. And I'm sorry about...
You're not safe anywhere nowadays.
Maybe it was yesterday. Been seeing me in your dreams?
Oh, yes I would. I'd know you any time --
You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
Others are...multi-sexual. It seems...they can be both masculine and feminine...simultaneously.
I'm going to give it to you straight. There's no point in beating around the bush. There were survivors. Apparently, the fallout has created....a subspecies of mutants.
It's not a pretty sight. Some eat out of garbage cans. Others are...cover your ears, Son, and hum. I mean that literally and I mean right now!
Really?
No, I can't. I'm sorry! I have to go! I have to...
Oh... some songwriter. In the studio apartment. Lives alone. Probably had an unhappy marriage.
Yes I'm fine. Everything is ok. It's fine. Everything is fine.
Hildy, I thought you were gone --
Nothing.
Yes.
There's a better place for us to eat.
I have a better idea of where we can go.
Nothing.
Thanks, Duane.
I would have taken a bullet for I you, Dave.
Just a minute just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr. Potter. You're right when you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life was . . . Why, in the twenty-five years since he and Uncle Billy started this thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy? He didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did help a few people get out of your slums, Mr. Potter. And what's wrong with that? Why . . . Here, you're all businessmen here. Doesn't it make them better citizens? Doesn't it make them better customers? You . . . you said . . . What'd you say just a minute ago? . . . They had to wait and save their money before they even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their children grow up and leave them? Until they're so old and broken-down that they . . . Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll ever be!
Lloyd?
You bet you should have called. You still live at home. Don't make me call the police at three-thirty in the morning, don't make me call hospitals.
Sit down.
Let me explain you something, kid. Stooling is when you rat on your friends, on the guys you're with. When Johnny needs a favor, don't try to figure it out, just do it. Now go ahead, join the congregation.
I took the couch. I had some work to do. About last night...
And where are you now?
We'll fix that, too.
You're not going to tell me, are you?
To get some frozen poultry.
Yeah! That's thinking.
I don't know. I like to think so.
Since when do you shop at the Flea Market anyway?
Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
There are places. I'll scuffle around.
Hey, wait. What are you gonna do about the money?
Yeah, you already told me that. You cut that slice down to bite-size and maybe we can talk.
I'm already rich. But I like action. That's one thing I think you're good for is action. Besides, like I say... you got talent.
Kiss off.
No, we don't talk. I don't make bad bets. Seventy-five, twenty-five. That's it.
You saw me beat Minnesota Fats for eighteen thousand dollars.
I never saw you do anything else.
Why back me then? Why not back yourself? Go find yourself a big fat poker game and get rich. You know all the angles.
Look, you wanna hustle pool, don't you? This game isn't like football. Nobody pays you for yardage. When you hustle you keep score real simple. The end of the game you count up your money. That's how you find out who's best. That's the only way.
Guess I made a boo-boo, huh?
We're not going on vacation..we're on a mission..
What kind of mission?
I suppose that means "Hi" ?
I'm sorry to have to resort to such methods, but we heard about your good luck on he radio and we need the tickets to Fhloston.
Is that the usual way priests go on vacation?
...Sorry, General, but we've got no choice! It'll only take a minute! Let me set up another meeting and I'll be back.
Oh, yes you will...
Now take that guilty look off your face, Pete -- and stop trembling like a horse.
Parry!
Hello, Olsen... Listen... Shoot to kill... That's the orders pass the word along... No! We dont want him! And listen, Olsen, five- hundred bucks for the guy that does the job... Yes, I'll be right out there. Well, I hope that's the right thing to do.
You know what you just signed, Jeanne? You just signed away my existence... For you I'm a lie, an illusion. You see? In the end, you were the one who abandoned me...
Are you sure you didn't leave the room... that one of the bellhops or maids might not have been in there alone?
As often as you like -- now, please -- for the love of God -- sign!!
That's all right. Well, we'll be going.
Goodbye.
What kind of joint are you running?
What -- what's that got to do with me? I'm not running any bookie joint.
Look, Baxter, I'm not stupid. I know everything that goes on in this building -- in every department -- on every floor -- every day of the year.
Would you mind repeating the question?
Think.
I don't know.
That's right, Baxter.
In 1957, we had an employee here, name of Fowler. He was very popular, too. Turned out he was running a bookie joint right in the Actuarial Department tying up the switchboard, figuring the odds on our I.B.M. machines -- so the day before the Kentucky Derby, I called in the Vice Squad and we raided the thirteenth floor.
You do?
Sort of.
All right.
No.
Thank you, but it's an appointment. I really shouldn't miss it.
All right.
The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin.
Thanks for waking me up. Picking me up. You're loud today.
In other times, with other purposes, there might be a band and bunting here at the bus depot for J.D. Singer's return from war. Last week he was decorated by a president for heroism in a war. But it was the civil war -- in Angola -- and he was in it for the money.
C'mon. I'm supposed to give you the tour.
So they tell me...
North, actually. How'd you ?
So -- which Dakota you from?
It was a bratwurst. I was eating lunch.
You the new guy?
Yeah. A couple. We're outnumbered by the cows, though.
I was kidding. People actually live there?
I can't hold them much longer, Ben. You better get out here.
Rocky, d'ya know what I done?
Twenty-one-years-old, ladies and gentlemen; four of those years spent accomplishing some rather extraordinary things at one of our nation's leading seats of learning --
Nobody wants a hare-brained product like this! Ya see, Buzz, it lacks the creative spark, the unalloyed genius that made, uh...
Yeah, but, buddy --
This is the most idiotic thing I've ever seen in my life!
Huh?! But, buddy --
...Why, this is worthless.
I done it all. I've done an' seen everything'. Believe what I'm tellin' ya -- Ya shoulda seen the night in Brooklyn, I smacked 'Ginny' Russo outta the ring, September 14, 1923 -- same night Firpo knocked Dempsey outta the ring. But who got the Press? He did. He had a manager -- September 14, 1923.
Nobody ever said that -- There's his picture.
Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
Just sounded like an old gal havin' a good time to me... You ready to dance?
Really think so?
Yeah, ya kinda remind me of the Rock. Ya move like 'im.
All right, let's go.
Well... to be honest... I'm really crazy about you and it's making me nervous and when I get nervous I'm not myself and I'm afraid I'm going to doing something really dumb before we get started so I think I should just lay back until I regain my composure.
Look, Mary, the truth is... I'll be in town for a while now but I don't think we should see each other for a few weeks.
Uh no. I think I'm gonna get out while I'm ahead.
Wow. That's too bad. He sounds almost perfect.
Consort? What does thou make us minstrels? An thou make minstrels of us look to hear nothing of discords. Here's my fiddlestick. Here's that shall make you dance! Zounds, Consort!
I guess it would be all right if - Lois, now that you know me, I think you ought to know it all.
You have a real philosophy of life.
I can't wait for you to meet her!
No, he's ruining yours.
"Hey, yourself."
Very much--
Yeah, just started.
Tight as a nun's asshole but qood concentration. Nice fruit.
Yeah. Tight.
Absolutement. They have their own label that's just outstanding.
It's going to be great. Here's to us.
Pour us a couple.
Here's to my last week of freedom.
As if you care. I saved your life, Peck. Those guys woulda killed us! You wanna give your baby to them?? They eat babies!
Oh, yeah. That's Maya.
You know her?
That's right you travel so much.
I forgot about that.
I thought that you were anyway.
Probably on their first date, right?
Dad!
Nothing important, but may I speak to him now?
Don't debate him; he'll say anything.
Oh, right.
It's just the God damned English doing everything by the book.
You can go wait out in the car, you want to.
Do you remember what we talked about?
Here is Seattle. And here is Baltimore. Case closed.
Take the radio, stay down here in the lobby, watch the elevator.
Yes--
I'm Willow Ufgood. I'm here to find Fin Raziel.
This can't be right. This isn't a sorceress. This is some kind of animal.
We need your help. To take this baby to Tir Asleen. She's a prin- cess.
She doesn't want us to go to Baltimore. She wants to meet us in New York City on Valentine's Day. On top of the Empire State Building.
Sweet Princess, you begin to sound most reasonable.
I can keep a victim alive for weeks... months, if I desire it... it's an art. They beg for death... I keep it just out of their reach. The pain remains constant.
We'll get you cleaned up, find a suitable gown... I imagine you'll enjoy a good meal?
At the moment, very little. Your company at my table...
A few day's nourishment will see your strength returning.
We'll make it, we'll be fine.
What for, Buster? What would you do if you met them?
...'Scuse me?
Hey! D'you have any other complaints? Just make a list and we'll stick it on the porthole! Okay?
I'll say she is!
-- oh I don't know --
Tortures so arcane, so medieval, even I haven't the words to describe them. If you've an ounce of pity in your heart, you'll throw caution aside, and unlock my door...
My newest book begins at my right cuff, continues across my back, and completes itself at the base of my left shoe...
Your Honor, I object.
Yes, I know. A week's gone by and we haven't got the Power of Attorney yet!
I don't care what I said. I can't strangle him, can I!
If he tells, it won't come true!
These are really swell! I mean swell!
Your roller-skates! I redesigned them! I think this new design will work even better!
Well, we did in my family!
Sorry. It's important.
Where's Timmy and Buck?
Say, you were pretty good. Jumping in like that. Got a brain, haven't you?
We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands.
I won't tell.
Funny.
I don't see any.
Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed.
Let's go right now. Let's go to the zoo.
Funny... I better go to bed.
Like being back in the yard, huh?
Hello.
Oh, grow up.
I'm going to Kentucky. To Louisville. With a friend. Try to make some money. I need it, the money. I'll be leaving early in the morning.
Now, I never hustled you. Even when I thought I was. You know it.
Sarah, I'm going to Kentucky to play pool, with a guy by the name of Findley. Now, I need the action and I need the money. I told you I'd be back.
I got no idea of love. And neither have you. I mean, neither one of us would know what it was if we saw it coming down the street.
So it's to be torture.
You've had a pretty tough break at that. Twice a Missus and still unkissed.
I didn't think I wanted to.
Sweetheart, what day is today?
Yes, I've been asking for weeks, a month, I don't know, also my leg was -
A nurse? Well, sure, a nurse is great. A nurse? Great.
It's impossible. I was buying or selling something. I've been to Cairo many times.
You should get the order you want.
It's fine. Mind your own meal...
Here -- find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in Havana.
Oh, right... 's fine. Thanks.
Oh, you know, the usual... keeping the world safe.
It was half-full -- about a dozen or so. You going to have to take her to the hospital?
How many pills were in that bottle?
And you should keep your nose out of another man's omelette... It's no big deal, Betty.
You got up! You did something! If you keep this up, you might be in danger of making a decision !
Go anywhere? Of course not! That would be doing something, wouldn't it? We wouldn't want to do something. Let's just sit here all night!
I'm not trying to be anything--I'm just doing nothing! If I wait and see long enough, then--with any luck-- I won't ever have to make up my mind! Decisions can be painful, after all...
What else? Can you give me cover, Mister B?
Are you kiddin'? He loves you.
Maybe.
How do you think I'm doin' with Lee?
That's enough, Fran.
You didn't really believe me, did you?
I mean -- about my getting a divorce.
Remember what we talked about?
Fran -- remember that last weekend we had?
I love you, Elaine.
Right. I'm sorry, Jonah, I'm sorry.
Stressed.
Simon's home. I was sort of hoping you could keep the dog until he's had a chance to think and adjust...
I think I know how to have a spice rack.
Shouldn't you have used a toggle bolt?
Stop it.
I'll never agree with you. Never, Elena.
Poem. Dylan Thomas. I thought of it when I saw you on the train.
You didn't look very happy.
And tonight?
I'm not losing it again!
No short game.
Why you son of a --
What line? The day you first laid your oily rap on my future wife you started a war!
Future wife? Get real, man -- you're nothing more than a glorified brother in her eyes.
Oh yeah, the plan was going along just fine until you showed up.
Hey, hey, hey, I'm not the one who started telling bald-faced lies about the competition -- that's crossing the line!
What are you?
You've never been in Constantinople?
But you have been in Venice?
Amsterdam?
Maybe if you quit running around after other women you wouldn't have so much trouble with this one.
Want to take a poke at him?
What did they look like?
Hey, Brad... how's it going?
I'm just picking some things up for the barbecue.
I don't want you to look up. There's someone on the skylight.
-- OK?
No thanks.
DEATH FIRST!!
Listen! I know a place! PLATO showed me before. An old deserted mansion near the planetarium Would you go with me?
Where you going?
Where can we go? I can't go back into that zoo.
Awful? No. It's just lonely. It's the loneliest time.
I felt like it.
This is a ludicrous situation. There must be dozens of men dying to use my shower.
Then I suggest you call one of them.
I dare you.
What are you doing?
Have you ever heard of anyone taking a shower with his shoes on? What a nut.
I usually sing a medley of old favorites when I bathe -- any requests?
Shut the door!
She's rich. We're still married. We have no pre-nup.
So, that's good, right?
Who was that?
That was -- oh, shit. What if he's on his way over there?
Huh?
Marylin! What have I done?
I don't know, but don't call me Marylin.
Jacques, take me back down... Please.
Look, Mattie, I know you're-
That shelter was in this bill.
Alan
Lots of shelters were in this bill.
Listen, you little...
Dave, the budget's a very complicated thing. Even I don't understand it sometimes. Now occasionally we have to make some cuts and...
Proms always make me sad. They're so final. Graduation. Everyone's scattering, moving on.
Don't talk such bunk! She's one of the acts on the ship. I just ran into her by accident.
You made your point... I was wrong.
We all expect the world to be fair. As if we have some right t...
Tell her what?
You gotta be hard, Eddie.
It's what Eddie wants. He, uh, told me to give you some money.
You're afraid of displeasing God when telling the truth?!
I think maybe I'll bring him back next week ...
What do you do to him?
I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
Jack, you with us?
Aye, lad... we've little else to go by.
We'll trust in faith, Gump.
Never knowing when it takes a turn or changes course.
Heading true north. We continue in that direction.
Easily said... the raven passed this way hours ago.
We'll find it.
This isn't working out for me anymore.
It's not you, it's me. I'm completely fucked up.
I'm still trying to ditch this Texas Smokey. I don't know what the sucker wants.
As far as John Law knows, I'm just a joy ridin' Georgia redneck. We keep 'em outta your backyard, we're cool. Now just give me five to ditch this idiot and I'll meet you in Ole Miss.
What they all want -- to handcuff a hero.
Do I have a choice?
On its way. Give me a coupla minutes, okay?
'Bout fourteen miles this side of Mississippi.
What's your twenty?
Well, I always painted. Always. And my mother always encouraged it. She was sort of fabulous about it actually... and she used to... I was too young to think there was anything at all wrong with it... and she was very natural. She used to pose nude for me... and I thought or assumed my father was aware of it.
This stuff is pointless.
You like sad stories -- you want mine.
... my father didn't leave his room for 11 years -- he hit my hand with a yardstick if I made a mistake on the piano.
Early eighteenth century. I should say around--seventeen thirty.
Passionate! He's a pervert. He should have to register when he moves.
To him? He's a sick freak.
Why not? I'm going to have her for a lifetime.
I'd just like to have a word with her.
Excuse me, Mr. Doyle, if I could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.
Yeah, Skip, you wanted to see me?
We were in love... weren't we?
If it makes you and mom feel better, go for it. I gotta run--
Dad--if my curveball is hanging, God ain't gonna help me.
So why do you keep the picture up? You wish you hadn't quit?
The President's in Europe. Tomorrow he'll be in Turkey. Right along this fault line. They launched the space shuttle yesterday.
He's cutting funding for NASA. The milk cow of the aerospace industry. We're talking billions. Motive enough?
Not exactly the kind of thing a Secret Service Agent can throw himself on top of.
You going to warn him?
And the money goes--
You're a guest here?
What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
I'm not alright. We both know that. The only reason I'm here now is to warn you. You're still in danger. Gaston told me that Claude has got the curse too. He's a werewolf.
Sure. Don't you?
Nice looking group.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
What do you want?
What do you want?
You do?
Hurt me again? Not a chance, don't worry about it.
What?
No, it's got a little left. They'll be in to change it.
What's the thousand bucks for?
Don't get sore, Joe. This is something you got to do for me. I need a thousand dollars and I need it quick. I'm in a jam.
That's it. I got it all written up. Ready to go. All I want is a thousand dollars.
Huh?
What!
To tear down the Walls of Jericho.
That she's going to marry somebody else.
Blue moon...
Liza?
I did. Hold the wire.
Tell 'em to hold the wire.
We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --
Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
What do you want?
How's that?
Is that so? Well, have you seen enough - or would you like a photograph?
Now get this mug. You've got the kind of chin I just love to touch. And if you don't get out of here, I'm going to hang one right on it.
Well, we can't force her. It's her decision.
I'm not jealous of the dogs.
I am no one to be trifled with, that is all you ever need know.
Now, Jack-lad, no one's asking ye to skewer the worm. Even St. Michael'd have a job on his hands for all that. But the serpent hoards a pile of booty, Achilles' armor among his treasures... if we find our way within the mound and him asleep...
Knaves and robbers...
No less a creature than the Lindfarne Worm.
So I'm to be a dragon-slayer, is that it?
There's the spirit, lad. If ye run into trouble, give a yank here and we'll haul ye up.
What's left of me... How do I recognize the armor of Achilles?
Better pray the worm's a sound sleeper, Jack.
You do the praying. I've work ahead.
You'll know it when you see it... tis a splendid sight, all covered with gold... Don't fear making noise. Dragons be deaf as tree stumps.
Have you not a man whom you value?
Know what? Know what, goddammit!
What's your twenty?
But, for a time... a passing fancy?
How can I believe that there is not a man who has inspired desires in you?
Have you had one?
I'm pulling up.
I'd like to take Jamie to dinner on New Year's Eve.
EVERYBODY'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE. ..NOW WE'RE RIGHT WITH YOU. YOU ARE INVERTED. ROLL IT, COUGAR.
Ever again.
We're on vapor, Cougar, you got to put it down.
It's crazy, man. Instruments are crazy. We're gonna have to eject.
Hollis probably told you we found Charley Wade.
Fellas.
Of wa?
Yo Rock. Did I give you a job this mornin? How come ya didn't break this guy's thumb like I asked ya? When ya don't do what ya are told, it makes me look bad, kid.
I figure if I break the thumb this guy gets thrown outta his job and can't pay nothin' no more.
Just relax.
The plane is fine.
Yeah, I guess it is. We did it! We did it...Damn! We sure did it!
Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
You mean him.
Well, I'll tell her I ran into you.
Kim and I are close friends!
Where would I have seen your work?
Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
With pleasure, Madame!
As a matter of fact, I was just trying to decide the color of Anne's eyes. I can't tell whether they're blue, or whether they're violet. What would you say, Mrs. Schuyler?
...that way we have someplace to go when we cut. And I just sit here, I nod my head and look nerdy.
Don't be silly. What are you sorry about?
I just need you for another minute now, so we can shoot from behind towards me, and, um...
You bet, honey.
You're forgetting Howard Doyle?
Mr. Rexroth.
Dogs?
Then was it worth it?
Rex, please.
Miles Massey. Please sit, relax, and consider this office your office, your haven, your war room -- for the duration of the campaign.
No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it?
Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was.
Did Lester know about him?
I don't like cake.
Who's Annie?
No thank you, Quince. I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
Oh, the goddam party --
But he does give a shit. Don't you, Bill?
I miss you, Annie.
Nothin-- --I just remembered the name of a guy that owes me fifty bucks.
Taking forever. I just got an additional list of sixty-two employees to interview before Monday. I don't know how I'm going to do it.
So, how are you doing in Marlboro country? Is the magazine complaining at all?
When are you coming home?
Well then... maybe I will take some time... come visit.
You'll do what I tell you. Now get the fuck inside.
Keep moving --
Nobody's gonna get you but me!
Great, great, fantastic. Fantastic. Incredible. Incredible, really incredible.
I'm gonna open the shop, baby, I'm gonna open the shop. I'm getting it together.
Okay...
Thanks for coming.
I missed ya. What can I say?
It doesn't matter. The publicity's the main thing.
Well, I don't know if that's ethical. You see, all statements are supposed to come from me.
A joint interview, eh? That might be all right. We could have our pictures taken together, Doctor.
You said it!
Me, too.
What...what about your script? So what's it about?
You have to remember, we-we-we didn't agree on one thing.
Okay, okay. I'll just call your mom and have her come pick you up.
Mmmm, you're right. Those clothes don't do you justice. Why don't you take them off.
I'm sorry that was out of line.
Why not? ... Oh wow, she doesn't know you're here. In fact, you're grounded. Jesus, you could get in a shitload of trouble for this. I think I should call her anyway.
You got him involved?
Like we had a choice? Besides -- when you let the enemy think he's orchestrating the battle, you're in a position of power. We let him pretend he's calling the shots, and while he's busy setting up the plan, you have time to woo Bianca.
So what you need to do is recruit a guy who'll go out with her. Someone who's up for the job.
Sure it is, Sweet Pea, but he should've warned you 'scuzzy' female types about the 'Puget Dudes.' They'll tell you they're wearing a rubber but they've bit a little hole in the end.
Think there's any truth to what he was saying about those girls? Is that still going on?
That Foley looks like he's been through a war or two.
I've seen better.
To fetch your napkin.
Damned hunters. It was a trap, and you were the bait!
Who?
Some new things would be useful. I don't need any "new help."
You'll be in trouble, son. Now just how do you intend to support your family?
It ain't in me.
It's for your own good.
So I been told.
What's she so emotional about?
You can be cocky now, boy. But you won't make it. You won't last. I just feel sorry for Josie. I knew it wouldn't work out.
I don't know. She got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?
They want to replace me! The Board of Trustees wants to replace me!
Paris?
I'm sorry...
What s going on?
You look great.
Did not.
You said we could go to New York.
I can't know what I said, but we're not going.
Did too.
Shut up.
What's wrong with Annie?
This conversation is finished.
Shut up? Shut up??? Mom never did that. Mom never said shut up to me. Mom never yelled at me.
Geller, we've been over this. You're a great copy editor. Maybe my best copy editor. You're not a reporter.
I think she's great.
Used?
This is getting serious.
I don't know.
What time did you make it for?
I love her.
I know what I look like.
I got beat up. They... They broke my thumbs.
There's a wonderful smell about Iowa -- very particular to this part of the country. Do you know what I mean?
Oh well, great. Perfect. Oh no -- shittity brickitty -- it's my sister's birthday -- shit -- we're meant to be having dinner.
there's this thing out there. This paternity suit.
Yes?
Me. It's Eddie.
Yeah, what if I am? What about it?
There's just one thing more. If it weren't for Miss Dawson being here with me, I'd probably bump your heads together.
Come on!
Get me into a plane!
'Her'.
I won't eat cheese for no cops, that's for sure.
Edie, your old man's right, go back to that school out in daisyland. You're driving yourself nuts you're driving me nuts stop worrying about the truth worry about yourself.
You know what you're askin'? You're askin'
Don't say that, Edie, don't...
Who is he?
Gangster. Drug Dealer. Somebody you don't want on your ass. Look, Clarence, the more I hear about this Drexl fucker, the more I think you did the right thing. That guy wasn't just some wild flake.
Whatever I got, I always got on the slide. This shot's no different. I didn't earn nothin' -- I got it on the slide... I needed ya help about ten years ago when I was startin', but ya never helped me none.
If ya was wantin' my help, why didn't ya ask? Just ask.
They're all divorced?
Bites what?
I don't want to be alone.
I didn't know that.
It does?
Are you bringing your laundry woman?
Nope.
If you don't hang around in this circle, no reason it should.
But those instructions, they're recorded in the computer.
OF COURSE... Well yeah, a bit. "Sin City" by the Flying Burrito Brothers is an all-time top five, but I wouldn't play it at the club. It's a country-rock ballad. Everybody'd go home.
A man after my own heart...
If it were up to the Doctor, you'd be flayed alive.
The nineteenth... How come you didn t know?
I can't sleep anymore. It's too much like death.
Am I bothering you?
Sit down, Drew.
A flack jacket.
I ve been away. Did Leon speak to you about his sister?
I came all the way here for that? To walk the lobby?
Ya still light seventy.
...The juice is climbin' every week.
That's it? -- Completely?
How about once more around the park?
How would you like a spanking?
Him: 'Do you mind if I come in for a nightcap, Reggie?' Her: 'Well -- it is awfully late.' Him: 'Just one, all right?' Her: 'Promise you'll behave yourself.' Him: 'Sorry, baby, I never make promises I can't keep.'
We're here.
Don't you know I could already be arrested for transporting a minor above the first floor?
On the street where you live.
Where?
Then stop acting like one. If you're really in some kind of trouble, I'd like to hear about it. Otherwise, it's late, I'm tired and I'm going home to bed.
How would you like a punch in the nose? Stop treating me like a child.
No, I...
Well, no wonder. We just met, made love and broke up all in the space of thirty seconds and I can't even remember the first kiss which is the best part.
So are you, but I think maybe you should shut up now... ... I'm not coming up to your apartment. That was never my idea.
Oh no, I want to. I've got a hard-on for you the size of Canada... but I don't... want just one night. I have a confession to make?
No.
So from there to there?
Nice work.
I made it.
Peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
That's not the country Luke fought for.
Next time, it might be the FBI. The time after that, it might be the President. But it'll always be someone. Count on it.
It's wrong, Leo.
Lest we forget, Peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than Luke's.
Not this time, Kat.
Enjoying our hospitality?
No!
We'll have to see what more we can do for you, while you are still our guest.
Thanks, but I don't intend to stay.
Did he ever refer to the hostility between them?
I've had many... when the sea doesn't want you.
Warm? Man, it's ninety-five degrees in here, sometimes a hundred -- the way Emanuel always kep' it so his boys'd sweat, get lean and mean like Tommy Hearns. No, I ain't talking any business in here. To me this is holy ground, man. You understand? I got to be someplace anyway. Y'all want to talk, come to the fights tomorrow night, we'll sit down and look at it good. The State Theater.
Is there anything to understand?
Are there truly no extenuating circumstances?
And you still haven t told me why you sent me after Friedman.
Let's go outside and talk.
Sometimes she gets me so crazy, I'd like to split her head with a razor.
Don't get mental, man.
Ya caught me in a bad mood.
Ya always in a bad mood --
...Adrian ain't sharp.
I don't get it, but at least Gary's got the real stuff coming up here in a few minutes.
Why? Just because you left us standing on the side of the road?
Hans was very attentive to you.
You know, Elden, some people actually read more than just the Classifieds...
Okay. Recommended...
Didn t you say I came recommended? That s what I thought. May I know by whom?
Recommended?
Well, I would have to point out that we could have dealt with that question when you called this morning, Mrs Spitz. I wouldn t like to think I d kept you waiting for nothing.
No really, I can stay a while.
Well I guess I don't have to go Right now. I guess I could stay a little while.
We're going to get some food.
Mission accomplished.
We don't have much time. Let's move. I'll explain everything.
Lovely.
Yes. Sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I know. I know that it's....
Each pudding cup has to be scanned individually so that...it's for a giveaway...a product giveaway by this company...
No... and you're supposed to be sensitive and sharp.
Because... ... you love her?
So long.
I should've danced with you.
I'm a great guy -- "extraordinary"... ... and she doesn't want contact with me. I'm dying here.
What did she say?
I'm coming.
You going to come talk to me or not?
Yes I do. Your son is a material witness to a homicide.
It's that Doctor fellow, isn't it? He's come to usurp your place here, hasn't he?
I guess we all did. You know, I didn't marry Leslie because I loved her. I married her to forget you...
They can't be serious.
More than your writing's at stake. The Ministry has threatened us with closure.
You're late, Eric.
Our future lies in the stroke of your pen.
Fuck 'em! They're half-wits and pinheads. Let 'em die on the streets, as Nature intended.
Put yourself in my place. I've your fellow patients to consider. If Charenton falls, they've no place to go. No manner in which to clothe or feed themselves --
You among them?
All right.
It's in the report.
No. They never did, really. But that's what I'm going to recommend. The next step. Unless something --
Goodbye, Pete.
Is he dead?
Is this your dad?
So what's the question?
I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
You can turn that finger around.
Not yet. I had a phlemless morning. I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer.
It's nice that they're still friends.
That must have made you proud.
Excuse me? Could I say something?
You got plenty of money?
Of course.
Then lemme remind you, the polite thing is to say, thank you, that's a real nice offer, I don't mind taking you up on it.
Sorry about this hand. You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment?
And then --?
She said lots of thing.s
Sure.
Everywhere and nowhere, Paula the Polack.
Italian. My mom was Irish. I got her ears. But the rest is all wop.
Hey, what kind of name is Pokrifki?
Yes, ma'am. Four long, hard weeks of sacrifice for my country... for my people... for you. But I survived.
You told me I can come 'cause I caught you digging the fuckin' tunnel, saw you and Lulu coming out of the bushes, thought maybe you two were making out.
I mean with the Manchester people?
My secretary?
Yes. I'll meet you at Grand Central at noon. Okay. Do me. I command you.
Dad, Adrian's got the whole city after me. He's always a step ahead. What am I gonna do?
What are you gonna do? Look at me, Nicky! I got no legs, I got no hips, I got one ear...
How are you, Jane?
Ooooooh-kayyyyyy.
Well, by saying that, you're acknowledging the existence of a higher power. Which, to a narcissist, is impossible.
A narcissist doesn't admit it. It's the extreme of self-denial.
Tedious. I now authorize you to throw away all personal mail.
Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm running late.
Now what did you lose?
Mr. Preysing -- one sixty-four.
Hey, you did better than I did, Nova.
...okay...
I'm not good in math.
You actually said that?! Haaaah!!
-- Uh... Buzz, I'm sorry, I -- Buzz, you gotta forgive me! I shouldn't a fired you, I didn't know what I was doing! I was a little funny in the head, I --
Aw, buddy, I don't care about that.
...It is?
Sure, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid said I could have the job back.
...You don't?
Nah, that's all forgotten.
But he told me you stole that swell hoop idea from me. What gives!
Claude.
Oh God. Shit...
People come here to catch bass and to get laid at the Boy's Town in Cuidad Leon--
What?
Ben, can I say something to you?
How long have you and I known each other? How long have your Dad and I been partners?
How long have we known each other now?
Sir?
I know.
La what?
Why you talking to me?
When your husband get hit by the bus?
How many men since then?
I don't care about Luck, you understand me? It ain't that.
Now and then. You know how it is.
Yes sir, boy, they, heh, they say that old Fats just shoots the eyes right off them balls.
Is that a fact?
California. Oakland.
That's right.
California? Is your name Felson? Eddie Felson?
What s his problem?
This isn't some Picasso print you steal out of a car dealer's rec room.
...I am at home with the me. I am rooted in me, who is on this adventure.
Do you mind taking those things off the Walls of Jericho? It's tough enough as it is.
Okay. Repeat this after me.
Gladly.
Me?
What else? Say more.
I wrote that.
This is Miss Marsh.
You'll have a good time with me. Want to? I've got enough money. Ten thousand two hundred in my pocketbook. Three thousand four hundred that I won. It will last a long time. I can win more -- we'll travel.
Tastes good to me. You live around here, Stephanie?
Well, I've come to never expect greatness from a Cab Franc, and this one's no exception. Sort of a flabby, overripe --
Oh yeah? We're just over in Buellton. Windmill Inn.
You know a gal named Maya? Works at the Hitching Post?
No shit. We just had a drink with her last night. Miles knows her.
You have to give them your phone number or they won't let you go on the air.
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I am an SWF"-- What is that?
She hasn't told anybody, what am I supposed to do?
They called and asked for it. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle. You are the most attractive man I've ever laid ears on."
And I can't believe you are so stubborn and so blind as to let some stranger, some phantom you've never even met destroy it.
What-
Thank God. Something you don't know. It's a single white female.
Jesus, last night it was some guy honking his car horn. I mean, the city can't close down. You know, what-whatta yuh gonna do, h-have 'em shut down the airport, too? No more flights so we can have sex?
Don't get upset!
Hey, come on, it's quiet now. We can- we can start again.
Well, I can't li- We can't have this discussion all the time. The country makes me nervous. There's... You got crickets and it-it's quiet... there's no place to walk after dinner, and... uh, there's the screens with the dead moths behind them, and... uh, yuh got the-the Manson family possibly, yuh got Dick and Terry-
Yep, there they are... They always look the same every year...
Is it the machines? The noise? The people?
Okay, um, so it's Lloyd and... uh... uh... let's go out. Do you wanna go out?
Maybe she doesn't need any. Should we check?
What do you want?
What plan?
No. No, not Miss Sinclair. I'm talking about Adele Lardner.
What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
Yes.
Busy?
I go to funerals.
No.
Oh, yeah. Hey, little fellow you worry me. You got someplace to sleep?
Okay all right. Double bourbon, quick, huh?
You'll see a lot of strange things from now on.
What's the matter with him. I never saw Nick act like that before.
I've been dreaming about you.
I been sendin' her money.
Like where?
I have lost my gift. It's as if my quill is broken. As if the organ of the imagination has dried up. As if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.
I take it you learnt to live with yours then. Take it all the mind-dulling pills in your medicine cabinet are surplus to your well-being...
Am I mentoring the wrong mentee?
Didn't I tell you, she dumped me Monday night.
It just happened.
She's cool.
Well she --
Oh, come on! Let me give you ten dollars for this, and you can give the rest away for all I care.
What's the -- hey, Liz --
It's true!
Suppose I go in for a little while and you wait in the lobby-bar. How's that?
Forty-four, the top brass floor say, buddy! What takes fifty years to get up to the top floor and thirty seconds to get down?
I --
It's what I've learned.
Thanks.
It's okay.
Yeah.
One cervical stabilizer, two sets of dilators--Douglas points. One medium- sized curette, one small; one medium speculum, one large; two vulsellum forceps.
Jesus Christ, there's Norma Stern. Look at her hair.
What's that? What's it called?
Mr. Rose, I'm in the doctor business. If you want, I can help you. You don't have to go anywhere.
What business is you in, Homer?
Just look!!
How do I leave here?
I promise.
The sky!!!
Up there!!
I guess we'd better try somebody else.
No, we won't! The next time that jumping jack comes out, I'll straddle him while you ask him your questions.
Uh...actually, yes. Two... good ones.
You have kids, Jack?
If you graduate.
Do you have a guy like me every year? A guy to... I don't know, make a show of. Teach other kids lessons and stuff?
Well, you'll find out next year.
Hey, Mr. Hand, can I ask you a question?
What's that?
You're gonna flunk me?!
Don't worry, Spicoli. You'll probably squeak by.
I can see that, Alan.
What kind of life have you got here? Scufflin' around the small rooms, picking up eight, ten bucks a day?
Aah! I've got no stomach for that any more. I've had that kind of life.
How do you want me to play it? I'm broke.
Oh, don't play it small, Charlie. It don't look good on you.
You walked out on me like that. No goodbye, no nothing. Like a thief in the dark. We were partners. We were more than partners. He was like a... like --
So am I... Sit down. Would you get us a couple of drinks?
Yeah, yeah, like a son. I've known this boy since he was sixteen. The first time I saw him, back in Oakland, I said, "This is a talented boy. This is a smart boy."
A son.
I want you to come back on the road with me.
Talk to me, Charlie.
I was a sales associate, at E.F. Hutton.
I don't want to fight either. Look... uh -- I love you.
You're discharged.
An embezzler -- you're going to take that back, right here in the presence of this young lady -- who do you think you're talking to? You think I'm dirt, if I'm dirt, you're a lot dirtier, Mr. Industrial Magnate Preysing.
Yes you -- shut your mouth -- get out -- you're discharged.
Me?
Go away -- go away.
Who are you? -- An embezzler most likely.
You don't like to see me enjoying myself.
I'm a little cold.
What's wrong?
Whatever.
It was the PLO.
--Nooo--
That's strictly B ader-Meinhof stuff.
--Yes. And the Munich Olympics in '72. A local radio station started broadcasting news of the massacre two minutes before it happened.
Say what?
Where have I been?
Kitty...my situation is really not important. The thing is, my girlfriend is now living with, and possibly engaged to, a demented monkey.
I hope she's all right. How much more do I have to do of this?
No. But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading. And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting.
What?
No, indeed.
Quite. I think I'd best take it back.
I wanted you to.
Well not far, just down the hall. Plus Grammoo's room's a lot bigger, and you get a view of the whole neighborhood.
Okay thanks, atta girl.
Oh, she's fine, she'll love her new room.
Jimmy...
My pigeons... .
Every one of 'em... .
I missed you. I'm sorry. Tell me the plan.
And didn't you order the citizens of Paris to surrender the city in the name of the King of Heaven?
To tell you?
Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
Well -- goodbye then --
Yes?
What?
What was I gonna do, call dad? I don't even know his number.
No, it was a table.
Five.
You know when you sat behind me?
I finally knew what I wanted when I grew up.
You can trust me, Mister. I'll keep my mouth shut.
I won't say anything. Honest, I won't.
Yeah ? How do I know? I gotta good mind to plug you. I shouldn't take any chances on you.
Orange, New Jersey.
Got a couple of kids, huh?
Where do you live?
Yeah. Just babies.
You love them, don't you?
I cry a lot too. I'm a big cryer.
Yeah.
So there you are. So I guess I'm not such a dog as I think I am.
Oh, I cry all the time, any little thing. My brothers, my brother-in- laws, they're always telling me what a goodhearted guy I am. Well, you don't get goodhearted by accident. You get kicked around long enough, you get to be a real professor of pain. I know exactly how you feel. And I also want you to know I'm having a very good time with you now and really enjoying myself. So you see, you're not such a dog as you think you are.
I don't know either. I think I'm a very nice guy. I also think I'm a pretty smart guy in my own way.
If you don't know shit, why does he think you can sell it?
Totally groovy huh?
It has to be Tom. You said he ripped up his own pictures, he --
Hey, man.
I remember you turned around. Your face was dark and your hair was backlit -- I could see a halo of frizz -- you asked me if things were okay between Naomi and me.
Uh... I'm shipping out sooner than I thought. I just wanted to be sure you were settled in--and happy enough, considering... Are you bored stiff? Or can you stick it out for a bit?
Okay. I wish you could come.
I hope you get your work done.
Just a little overworked, maybe.
He had the club out on the old trail road--
It's over.
She denied it. Said I was crazy and paranoid.
That's what I love about Wyatt. He can talk himself into anything.
You do want me to keep the job, don t you, Mrs De Moraes?
You were right. It's nothin' like I thought. I almost wish...
I just want to show you how foolish you are. When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
You know I never stop you from anything. Believe me--you're at a wonderful age. In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
Yes, I said it. Sure, I said it. I didn't say it for publication, however.
Hell, peanut...
Actin' funny how?
Roger, I've got it.
Do you remember Beethoven? The Beatles? Movies, books, restaurants, friends?
I know.
But, it's great being with them, after they can talk, and can do things with you.
Where'd you grow up?
We used to have fun, she used to like to go to places with me for my movies and we would laugh at all the weirdos, but now she's tired of it all. She never wants to leave the kids, she doesn't need me, and they don't need me, I feel like I'm in the way. It gets complicated when you have kids... that changes everything.
When they're born its like Vietnam. It's terrifying.
So if defendant had tied up to deceased's boat. With that last one. Would those cleats have lined up?
Found on Carl's boat, too. Starboard side, second cleat from the stern. But it doesn't match Carl's lines. It matches Miyamoto's. perfect.
You bet. And if Miyamoto there had been in a hurry to cast off, he coulda left this line behind on Carl's boat.
Jesus, don't do that! If it gets around that you fired me, I'll never land a pilot.
That's not a bad idea. How many episodes before he comes back?
I don't think she can do it. You saw what happened.
What about me? Don't you wanna know how I feel about it? I'm the one who...
Are you by nature a sadistic person?
WHAT!
Three kids. What's she going to do?
Oh! You caught me.
Men sill give women flowers, don't they? I mean, as a sign of appreciation? I'm not that out of date, am I?
In the Yellow Room, where the music's playing and the ladies are?
I'm going to change and we'll meet for a drink in the Yellow Room.
We've been together all day... and in an aeroplane.
Yes, quite.
Yes, thanks to the Baron. The best shops, the very best. Look, Doctor, silk -- feels so nice on the skin... a London hat, see -- made in England, that's silk, too -- fifty marks... Look, the price is on it. That was half my salary before. The Baron is a very fine gentleman -- no one in my life has been so nice to me as the Baron.
Your chauffeur's been waiting, Baron.
Madam Grusinskaya -- at once --
Baron, we must have gone a hundred miles an hour, at least...
They've fired the moat!
Water doesn't burn...
Very thrifty. Even got your arrow back.
Purely a precaution...
Take your time.
Sir?
My old lady swallowed a bottle of pills one day while I was at school.
What's stopping you?
That's no excuse for not going after what you want.
I don't want to move. But somebody has to move sometime. Eventually.
Where'd she go?
It's a risk.
No... Friends from the diner maybe?
That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
One question, Doctor, please! You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
Oww, the arm, the arm!
She's a friend of Jill's.
Well she...
Yeah, well, if it turns out I get shot like a dog, it'll be in the street, not off a goddamn fence.
Oh, you mean of Bonnie and Clyde? Hm. You ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat? You could tell he had that don't-give-a-shit air about him.
Is that right?
Thank you.
I live right near there. The 800 Block of Maple. Come here. Marylin -- come here right now before -- just come here.
No. Don't stop.
Yes. I just got that, actually. It was a gift.
Can you see the other PIRs?
Ahm -- combination of factors really. No clean clothes...
Hey.
Hi...
Martin -- your customer.
I'd like to get in my two cents' worth.
Yeah, but we got a little bit done. And if you do a little and I do a little... then maybe the next guy'll do a little...
Yeah. And it's better than not believing it Their faces are inches apart.
Why would I be angry? It was beautiful.
Well, we laughed. We laughed all the time.
Right.
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be all right.
I'll go up.
Call it.
Let's cut out the small stuff, huh? Hundred dollar freeze-out. Ten games, ten bucks a game, winner take all. And then we'll see who quits.
Shoot.
You know what, kid? I think maybe you're a hustler.
Okay, I guess.
Yes, that's right.
Me? I was a minor missionary, a heretic really. But where else could a red-blooded American boy lie, cheat, steal and kill with the sanction and blessings of the All-Highs? Besides, now I'm trying to pay my penance.
And what did I say?
My dog. One I intend to put to sleep. Extrapolate from there.
I'll bring her in. You let them go, and I'll bring her in.
Claire!
I brought the girl. She's outside.
I'll prove it!
She's good with that knife! She's real fast. She's a lot better with that knife than you is, Muddy! And who do you suppose taught her?
If that was your knife, Muddy, I wanna thank you for givin' it to her-- no girl should be goin' hitch-hikin' if she don't got a good knife with her.
She just plan misunderstand me--I was tryin' to give her my knife, I was just reachin' to touch her hand. But I understand if she misunderstand me--it's all my fault, ain't that right?
Where'd she get you?
My point is, that's probably what you're gonna end up with.
Who are you calling, Miss Kubelik?
Ma'am?
I didn't really do anything -- honest -- I mean, you take a girl out a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're serious -- marriage-wise.
I'll fix you some coffee.
Mrs. Dreyfuss, can I borrow some coffee -- and maybe an orange and a couple of eggs?
Oh, you don't have to worry --
Not that I have anything to hide.
Relax, Baxter.
Oh -- terribly sorry. It's that cold --
Yes, of course.
You know how people talk.
Now remember, Baxter -- this is going to be our little secret.
Pardon me?
Yes sir!
Sir?
Okay -- I'll tell you what -- we'll just sit around all day long being frivolous -- how about that?
I'm calling your office so you can send out a man to trail him. I want to see where he goes.
It's a spice rack.
The hopes are perfect -- beautiful, identical, smooth -- and they are for something really amazing I feel it in my bones --
It's never happening again. Right?
Dad? About last night?
We desperately need a spice rack. Desperately.
Sit down! We didn't come here to watch you and that broad dance around a May pole. Where were you the afternoon the girl was killed?
I don't mean to alarm you, but I'm getting a nose bleed from the altitude.
Who're you calling?
I never did understand that story, did someone find the needle or not?
I think we're on the right track.
You're a wise guy--Gimme back--
Well, what'd you think?
What're you doing?
I didn't hear you come in.
...Stay in school an' use your brains, dig -- Be a lawyer, be a doctor, carry a leather briefcase an' forget about sports!! Sports can only make ya grunt an' smell -- Be a thinker not a stinker!!
He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government.
Quick, let me have that money. I'm broke and I'll need it for tips.
So Unruly Julie's comin' with me and planning the interview. You two go down to the editing bay, take the old footage and the new footage, put it together, and see what we got. Get it into shape so when we finish the interview, we can just stick it in.
Believe me, if anything had happened, that would have been one of the highlights. For you.
Oh, no--You're not gonna give my hard-earned money away.
Sign this, and I will confess you myself if you want.
Jeanne, I beg of you... sign! In God's name, don't you understand? I'm trying to save you! If you don't sign, the English will burn you to death! Is that what you want??
You're the most beautiful woman I have ever known in my life.
No!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Isn't that weird? I mean, I dated a little bit after my divorce, for four or five years. Six years. I know when my son was younger...maybe when he was ten or eleven even, he'd run up and wrap his arms around me.
And I'll have the special fish.
I don't know.
Thanks for your help, Peck.
Are you okay?
Peck! Quick! Douse the fire!
Happy Birthday. Happy Birthday.
I don't understand.
And we'll digest our food better.
Okay?
Yeah, why not, because we're just gonna go home later, right?
And-and uh, there's gonna be all that tension. You know, we never kissed before and I'll never know when to make the right move or anything. So we'll kiss now we'll get it over with and then we'll go eat. Okay?
Sure....As for the crap, I've got an idea.
Somehow, I'm going to have to band-aid that thing since we can't really replace it and then put a walkway over it.
Don't worry, I'll give you a hand as soon as I can.
Scout around and see if there's something, check that other corridor. If there's nothing, nip out and buy a broom and shovel.
No, he was talking about girls, I think.
Too right....Now the other thing we've got to do is start clearing up the rubble. Can you make a start on that?
No problem, I enjoy talking in my sleep.
Barricade the gates! Quick!
You're a sick puppy, Geller.
I will.
Hi.
Okay, just calm down. It's going to be okay.
No, but her words are in my head. I know what you think, that it's a trick, that I'm making it up. No, the words I heard, were her words.
Ten years, I think. What I miss?
Vivian...
Qualify for what?
I'm sure I could have.
You really had other offers?
I'm sorry. I think I was crying.
Is that all?
You're the one who said not to change anything. She's my ear to the investigation.
So it's not just the Hoovers who've got you rattled.
If you say so. The stripe.
I've got enough on my mind without that.
And you have sixty-eight dollars and thirty-seven cents in the bank. Your only source of income are my veteran's death benefit of forty dollars a month, to which you're no longer entitled since I'm alive, and these ten dollar a month cash deposits you make. What are those?
What was I doin' up there makin' a speech, anyway? Me? Huh? Gee, the more I think about it the more I could . . .
Well...
Between a new screen, paint, plumbing for the concession stand, and about a hundred other repairs around the theater... it's going to cost at least nine hundred dollars to get the Bijou into shape to open up.
Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that?
Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life?
Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue?
Central station, locker number 139 - combination JFK.
Go on back to the hotel.
I know when to quit. You don't. Win or lose, you don't know when to quit.
What do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just say it and you got it but PLEASE don't get off me now.
Please don't get off me now.
Ah, that's unfortunate, Mr. Felson.
For who, Mr. Findley? ...Bert, he only beat me by one point. Now, you can't get off me now.
Yeah!
Would you like your things now?
Release Mr Greenwell's possessions.
Would you go on back to the hotel? Take a cab, go on back to the hotel.
Sorry about that.
I can't leave the house?
Ok, bye-bye.
Does it make you happy?
What? What? What? What? What?
Virgil, please. Don't do this to me.
That's all you've got to say?
Sam, Ferrari wants you to work for him at the Blue Parrot.
I like it fine here.
He'll double what I pay you.
Yeah, but I ain't got time to spend the money I make here.
Suppose you run your business and let me run mine.
Suppose we ask Sam. Maybe he'd like to make a change.
Suppose we do.
My dear Rick, when will you realize that in this world today isolationism is no longer a practical policy?
Did you tell him he's spending the summer with me?
Sorry.
Oh my God, sir!
Pretty country.
Gently!!
You an indian?
They have nothing. In fact, they think it's drug related.
Do tell. Why drug related?
Too old, dull fighter. Bobby Judge is a good boy.
Oh, then you did hear from him?
You are very pretty. I would like to kiss you.
My friend Monsieur Philipe is a friend of Florentino.
You don't know Monsieur Philipe?
Kathryn, the only thing you're going to be riding is me. Now if you'll excuse me, I have some work to do.
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die.
Listen to me, both of you. This Is no good. This is trouble we Don't need. For the first time in Our lives we got a chance to stop Wandering and finally be a Family. Do this and you throw it All away. You saw what happened To Fred White.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Like you said, just gotta know How to handle 'em. Old Fred Wasn't up to it. We know that We're doin', Wyatt.
And a good read. Don't waste it.
I'm sorry, Katharine.
Every night I cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.
Tell me about your garden.
Okay, let's go... I got nothing for the record yet.
Oww! My arm, careful!
Good God... they're meat eaters, Roy, just drop the shit in there!
I can't... they prefer a more formal presentation. I don't usually go so close to the surface, but I was...
Ahh, what'd you do now... fall off your bike again?
No, it's nothing, I... my piranha just mauled me a little when I layed their food out.
...you are so goddamn weird. Oh, and by the way, get the hell outta here!
No, Elden, I need to...
That's how dry cleaning works. Now I'd like to quickly go over the digestive system of amphibians.
Captain Oveur?
I'm too old for me. That's my predicament.
Good night. Can I kiss you on the cheek, too?
Idle hands, the devil's workshop.
Everyone has secrets, it's what makes us human.
Insidious thing, wondering if your partner...has another partner.
Missed me bad, huh?
Now, now. Don't get exasperated. I realize that you've always avoided all but the most rudimentary involvements with men, and I might add, you've been wise. Heterosexual relationships seem to lead only to marriage. For men, marriage is a matter of efficient logistics: The male gets his food, bed, laundry, TV, pussy, offspring and creature comforts all under one roof, where he doesn't have to dissipate his psychic energy thinking about them too much, then he is free to go out and fight the battles of life, which is what existence is all about. But for a woman marriage is surrender.
He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million. And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings.
Oh my God, sir!
Are you busy on Saturday?
Good. So do I.
Ain't she goin' to take the boy?
He said not to tell.
Well, he's gone.
My little girl, the tough babe.
Because there's an arrow in your leg.
Tell that Vernon to mind his own business, Muddy.
Yes, I'm sorry, I struck him right here in your house. And I'll strike anybody in anybody's house that calls me a Cinderella Man.
Well, what else do you expect them to call you?
That's the fourteenth crack you've made to me. I'm keeping count. When you get to twenty, I'm gonna sock you right on the nose. As a matter of fact, I ought to sock you right now.
Certainly! I'll take care of this guy Bingy myself, personally. Now what are you crying about?
I'm stayin', Homer.
When it comes to this, you is the real thing--is that what you sayin'?
Jack!
Who's weak now, big brother?
You're straddling the state line. You're in two places at once.
Stand right here.
Maxine...
Yes, he is. He was my brother.
Carson Dyle is dead.
Could be.
But I'm not through complaining yet.
Oh.
What are you doing?
Cutting it out.
Who told you to do that?
You did.
Serious. When a man gets to be my age that's the last word he ever wants to hear. I don't want to be serious -- and I especially don't want you to be.
Yes, Sergeant?
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
No sir! But you have to be ready.
Out ridin'. So... how you doin'?
Hey.
People get hurt that way.
You bet your ass I'm right. You don't go out with a loaded gun, you empty the barrels!
Jesus Christ you're right.
The most honest moment in a man's life is the five minutes after he's blown a load. That's a medical fact. And it's because you're no longer trying to get laid. You're actually thinking like a girl. They love that.
Huh.
I don't have a phone.
No I'm not!
You look great.
You're Mabel - her sister - aren't you?
And you weren't there, when the coroner examined the wound.
It was an accident. They got in the line of fire.
You see, I-I've been thinking about it and I think that we should get married.
You look very pretty.
Why? You wanna live out here all year? It's like living in Munchkin Land.
Anya, I think you're crazy.
I wasn't running out on you. When I got over there-- made my plans--I'd have sent for you.
Do me another favor?
They've put you up to this, haven't they?
Kate McConnell. Sweet, shy... well- dressed. I'm giving her a lift to the next waterhole.
Listen, pardner; this ain't no time to be getting laid.
I think you'll enjoy this table.
Having you here, Anna, firmly establishes what I've long suspected, that we really are the most desperate hot of under-achievers.
I don't get it. Why didn't you go for it just now?
So long, Father.
I don't know. Maybe it's because I love Debbie or maybe it's hard for me to get off in a place that smells like egg salad. I'm not sure.
It's a convenience, isn't it, having your husband locked away! You no longer have to hold your tongue, or hoist your skirts! Or crack your mouth, so I can put it to its one pleasurable use! YOU'RE NOT MY WIFE, NO! YOU'RE ONE AMONG MY MANY JAILERS, AREN'T YOU?
Thanks. That makes us square.
Here's your fifty.
I'm going to return the bracelet right now and face the consequences.
Well, I'll be--!!!
Indeed I am a bride short. How is this to end?
Next time I get a vacation I'll spend it at headquarters. Good-night.
By the time I'm at the Belt, you phone and say, "How are you?" Forty-five minutes later I reply, "Not bad. How are you?"
I guess I'd better have something important to say if it takes that long to get an answer.
Two years ago, buddy.
Oh, yeah. Real well. Still do.
You waiting for me to say something? What sort of thing do you want? Look, I'll be at the restaurant tomorrow.
It's a rare thing. Takes a turning point.
I really don't know.
Did you talk to the police in East Proctor? Did the cops go to The Slaughtered Lamb?
David, please. The police are satisfied. I'm certain that if a monster were out roaming northern England we'd have seen it on the telly.
Then why the hell are you so quick to disbelieve me? You yourself said it must have taken incredible strength to tear apart a person like that.
You'd be surprised what horrors a man is capable of.
Look, Dr. Hirsch, I know I've been traumatized, but Jack was torn apart. I saw him. A man can't do that to someone with his bare hands.
No. In fact, your wounds were cleaned and dressed before you arrived here.
Did you see Jack?
Believe me. The Hound of the Baskervilles was an invention of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's. And if you'd read the bloody book, you'd find that Holmes discovered your house of hell a fraud, a fake.
You really think I'm crazy, don't you?
Okay!!!! Anything else?!?
Oh come on, why would I lie?
I mean dumb in the sense that they only happen once a year.
Lieutenant... I'm Danny Walker. I'm Rafe McCawley's best friend.
Before Rafe left, he asked me to be the one to tell you, if it happened.
Rafe's folks had a crop dusting business, owned their own planes. Real straight, frugal. My father was the town drunk. Went to sleep one night on the railroad tracks and was still there when the Dawn Express came along. Rafe and I were the only ones at the funeral. He took me back to his house, and I never left.
I smell nothing.
Some mistake perhaps that --
You don't know anything... borrowed your car. Didn't say why. And you never heard of that woman and her boy.
Yeah... I can put it all together when I get back, 'Til then, you know nothing, understand? Business as usual...
I don't understand.
Thank you. Now, where were we?
Come again?
Hiding him where?
Come on, Sheriff. We've got to get bail.
... Are you sure?
We'll still be able to talk when I'm away. The conversation will just keep getting longer.
Howard.
-- how did you get here?
More, I hope.
Yes. This one though is... very good.
I'm not its master.
I'll go search for it.
What's the matter?
Be patient.
Your command is my wish, Princess Lili.
What?
Promise me again...
But I ve done some good things too, haven t I?
I need you to remember me, Kate. How I am right now, right this very moment. I need you to put that image in your heart and keep it with you, no matter what happens.
What's that pleasant smell coming from, your skin?
Listen -- could you stop crying, please?
No. What I mean is -- that's why I've been acting this way. I'm not like this. I hate myself like this.
I just want to tell you something.
But could I just tell you this one thing?
School?
Yeah, but I see you moved it up.
You excited?
We will practice in the mornings, my boy, and I'll put you up to a thing or two worth knowing.
Then why bother curing me?
The locks.
To keep us from trying to leave. After an atomic blast there's a radiation half-life that lasts thirty five years.
Then after that it's safe.
To go up.
He did.
Everything's coming along just fine. Phil, I wanted to know if I could have a small word with you.
The point is there isn't much time, kid.
Honey, you all right? Did something fall?
Doing what?
Blue suit, gray suit, I'm still a fat man. A fat ugly man.
I'm ugly... I'm ugly! I'm UGLY!
Ma! Leave me alone!
Never will be much too soon.
That's right, Miss Packard.
She's a smart girl, Eddie.
I'm not angry, Richard. In fact, I'm completely relaxed. Thing is, I can't tell if it's the fish that're cooling me out or all those uncut diamonds on the bottom of the tank there.
I can't believe you're still angry with me, Jack, after all this time.
Positive?
Anybody ever done that to you before?
Hey, why're you always walking ahead of me?
Okay, no monkey business then.
It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
What?
Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
What's happening to you, Frank? You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it? You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
Look. I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday. What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
What-are you? A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank. Who's watching? Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
I'm sorry. I should've checked it out. I screwed up. But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
Basketballs, Frank. You had us playing for basketballs.
Mm-hm?
They're fantastic.
Zack, you little shit! You haven't changed a bit!
Now, Phil, I don't know if you've ever been on a set before---
Good. Are those foods?
You'll understand.
Ya know, I was.
In fact, this is not a married house -- it's a bachelor pad.
No. Stay. I want you close to me. This couch is wrong. It's not a "married couch."
Here's my card. Spend as much as you want. We get mileage.
I know. But I've converted most of them into ridiculous "Guy" rooms -- a billiard room, a card room, a gym -- Honey, want you to go out, as soon as you feel up to it -- and buy married things. Woman things. Personalize it. Marylinize it. Make this your house.
What gripes me is the two of them were guzzling my champagne while Sylvia and I wound up at the Guggenheim Museum.
Toot? It's more like a lost weekend. Neither of them showed up for work today.
No kidding. Buddy-boy and Kubelik having themselves a little toot!
Kubelik.
Who?
-- so yesterday afternoon I take Sylvia up to the apartment, and guess who he's got stashed away in the bedroom?
I just got divorced. Phyllis.
Good morning, everybody Well, maybe it isn't a good morning, huh? Anne, did you ever get the feeling that there was someone else in the room with you?
Too late... too late... there's no bringing her back.
Ooh, now, see, if I'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, I'da done this different. Let's start over. My name's George. What's yours?
Yes! We could stay with Leon!
Or we can't go back to Russia!
Or it might be the firing squad!
You found your way to us and we weren't easy to reach, were we?
We can't... but you are so ingenious, Leon...
Didn't we put up a strong resistance?
No, no.
Well, hello to you, darlin'.
No, no, it was great.
No, that's okay. All I need's a little nap.
You can't seduce me.
You said whatever it was you would understand.
Certainly not. I'm a happily married man.
Oh. Hello there, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
I seem to have dropped my key. Oh -- here it is.
All right -- I'll take you to the subway.
Why do all you dames have to live in the Bronx?
Oh, you don't have to worry about that -- nothing in there that anybody would want to steal... Good night, Mrs. Dreyfuss.
How long?
Nobody.
She great or what?
No. But are you -- impressed?
What?
Why not?
Reverend Sullivan. Can I ask you something?
Well, there's a question -- without an interesting answer.
How could there have been witnesses? It was so dark. We were running and I fell and Jack went to help me up and this thing came from nowhere... I don't understand what they're talking about.
In time I'm sure it will all come back to you.
There were witnesses?
So they said.
Doctor, my memory is fine. It's my sanity I'm beginning to worry about.
'Laura Scudder's Peanut Butter'. You like it?
Every word of it.
Sebastian, I'm not an alarmist.
I'm stag.
You say something?
Are you kidding?
What?
You can't just walk off onna girl like that.
She speaks: O, speak again, bright angel!
Well, you can tell me now. I'm reasonably sober.
They all say they wrote the John Doe letter.
Look!
What do they want?
Hey, boss. Get a load of this.
What?
I been thinking. Maybe I should drop you in Montgomery. I mean, the way things are going, it might get pretty hairy by the time we get to Atlanta.
Oh, yeah. Good for him.
Kate...
Was this supposed to be your room?
There's a problem, Lamar.
Obviously. Very difficult.
Is Sunshine your real name?
Hi.
It's over --
Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have?
Don't thank me. I should thank you. So long.
Oh, sure. Well, thanks for everything.
Well, I got to get back. You can find your way out, can't you?
Thanks a lot.
Well, anyway, I know Hildy's getting a good man.
Thanks. I'll phone Hildy right away to get that story.
Don't want to forget this, you know. Might start to rain again.
That's all I ask. Oh, wait a minute.
Well, she'll know some day.
Certified! I'm afraid Hildy'd feel ashamed to think she hadn't trusted you.
No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
Well, Mr. Felson, maybe you could come out to my place some evening. We could play a few games of billiards.
Ok. This is what you get when you're a pervert -- you said you'd help someone out and you didn't so we're just getting some money for her and that's that.
You know, please, I just wanna say that I didn't say I would help her out; I was very clear about it....I don't think that this is fair.....wait, wait, wait, ouch, ouch.....
Alright, alright.
HEY. You made a fucking sex call and now you're gonna pay. It's not a big thing -- just give us some money and then it's over -- we'll just walk down to the ATM and get your money out --
What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
Hey there. Tired of breathing?
Certainly. Goodnight.
Geez, I --
Hildy!
You got it back, eh? There's something funny going on around here.
I'll see she's there, Bruce, I promise you.
If she's not there, mother and I are leaving anyhow!
I'm taking the nine o'clock train, Hildy. And you can meet us at the station.
I know how you feel, Bruce, but you've got to forgive her. She's only a woman, after all.
Suppose she is -- I have feelings, too! Do you know where I've been for the last couple of hours? Locked up in a police station and she didn't move to do anything about it.
I'm sorry, Erin.
What?
Good boy. Good job. And you call yourself "not a doctor"! Keep an eye on her--she's in trouble.
It's a --
Happy birthday, kid. You want another Coke?
He's still married though, huh?
No, thanks.
It's obviously an aborticide.
Okay.
Okay.
Obviously.
It's not ergot, it's not pituitary extract, it's not oil of rue...
I don't know it.
Are these the articles?
Were you given an assignment to follow the activities of Longfellow Deeds?
Were you present when all these things took place?
Oh, the poet? Where?
Look - there's Brookfield, the poet.
I write poetry.
No. That is, I didn't Until I met you. I like talking to you, though Imagine my finding you right on my doorstep.
Wait.
I'll look forward to it.
Sure.
Aren't you going to tell me who you are?
You used to love it when I called you doll.
What's happening? Am I needed?
To make sure you re okay.
Jesus...
The entire wing?
Take a wild stab!
What do you think, Pitney? How much Explosives do you think that they really have in there?
Yes.
I just don't want anyone to know it's me.
No I just....I don't want to, I just want to be connected to talk to a girl.
I thought I was just gonna be connected to talk to a girl - that's fine, ok, I'm sorry, it's, um.....818....
Hello, this is Back.
I can't do that!
I'm in love with you!
What?
Now, baby... if I told you about her... then you couldn't count on me not telling anymore... could you?
Just do it!
Come on, relax...
You see all those guys with gold on their shoulders!!?... Oh, no, I think that was Johnson, Air Boss of the Kitty Hawk!
Come on, we beat an instructor. How many times in your life do you get to do a victory roll?
Just once, if they take your plane away.
Hey, see any controls back there? And anyway...we beat the Son of a Bitch!
Didn't everybody?
No...
You don't mind if I go instead, do you?
Fine!
ZAT!
To forget? Don't be so motherly, Midge. I'm not going to crack up.
Not with my Acrophobia, Midge. If I dropped a pencil on the floor and bent down to pick it up, it could be disastrous!
Did you come here with Wally--to not watch movies?
I didn't say that. Growing up in an orphanage, you're always lonely. You're just never alone.
I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
I never asked for any responsibility.
No, that's right -- I know that. She said she's using another name -- but the problem is she left the message with my flatmate, which was a serious mistake.
Did we just - hit something?
Are you okay??
I might wake up.
I am happy. It just so happens this is the happiest night of my life.
Not my choice of toast, but it's your call. To your triumph over Annette.
I am. Let me get the cards.
Did I what?
In any event, you still owe me my reward.
There's nothing here but a hundred dollar bill.
Yes, I've got it. Don't you think we'd better destroy it? So it won't fall into the wrong hands -- ?
You want me to move the television set in here? You play gin rummy?
Sure.
I know where to find him... He lies out on the marsh, raven-fodder; his horn torn from his head.
Hush up, Screwball. Do your own worm-sticking if you like the taste so well.
By the grace of God.
No false modesty, lad. You're a proper champion. Achilles' armor sits on you like it was forged to fit.
Well then, you've got the sword and you've got the armor; all's lacking is the steed.
Herr Laszlo, you have a reputation for eloquence which I can now understand. But in one respect you are mistaken. You said the enemies of the Reich could all be replaced, but there is one exception. No one could take your place in the event anything unfortunate should occur to you while you were trying to escape.
I love winning, Crash, you hear me? I love It. Teach me everything.
Learn your cliches. Study them. Know them. They're your friends.
Boring.
Write this down. "We gotta play 'em one day at a time."
Thanks. I don't think you'll believe who was just in here.
Wow. That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie.
Victoria.
That's what I'm having.
Me too.
Victoria! How the hell are you?
Hmm.
Well..um...you get an official membership card... Just sign that and we'll laminate it right here... Parry? You want to laminate Miss Sinclair's card?...
But we made a deal.
Who else knows?
But Ringo Starr doesn't look anything like Topol.
Keep it. You'll need it in America.
You should think about getting professional help.
Vivian, may I point out five more nights at three hundred a night is only 1,500.
Where you going? I'll walk along with you.
I might as well ask you the questions on tape. Is that all right?
But now that you have it -
A fright?... Five years of cowardice led to your brother being murdered and you wanted to give his murderer a fright?
What was the idea? Husband is filled with fear when he learns his child supplier s being tailed?
What happened? Adonis slapped you about a little and you reverted to cowardice?
Where is that?
Done.
I couldn't help it, Wyatt. I Looked at that woman and it was Just like somebody slapping me in The face. I mean these people're Afraid to even walk down the Street and I'm trying to make Money off it like some kind of God damn vulture. That's not me, That's somebody I don't even know.
I'll tell you at the end of the week.
Get me a couple of beers and a salami.
Only every time I'm in here.
Alright, go help Chris shovel up the last of the crap.
We don't need you.
...Well, you know me, Amy, at least better than that that dame does. Do you think I'm an imbecile?
Okay... then how 'bout we try out some French cuisine. Saturday? Night?
Well, I thought we'd start with pronunciation, if that's okay with you.
You're not helping.
Exactly my point
Jesus! Can a man even grab a sandwich before you women start dilating?
Forget it.
Oh, he's not the man for you. I can see that. But I sort of like him. Got a lot of charm.
If anybody had told me I'd be sitting at lunch with him -- but he swept me right off my feet.
Maybe it wasn't her that paid him. Maybe the money was for somethin' else. How the fuck do I know? I'm just an old city cowboy tryin' not to fall outta his saddle.
It doesn't make sense. She didn't know me three months ago.
In that little pissant car of yours? Hell, no. I ain't gettin' no back pain disability retirement -- I'm gettin' me a full pension and a real gold-plate Seiko watch.
You all right, pop? You want me to drive you?
That's her pussy talkin' --He gets a real nasty look from a very fat woman eating a cheeseburger. He winks at her. The woman looks away from him, shaking her head.
Too hot?
That's ridiculous.
Back off, John.
I've been waiting for you to get back.
And I intend to be there when she's ready.
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
A Rep from Miles Jergens' Promotions was lookin' for ya -- They need sparrin' partners for Creed.
Yes! Yes! The Holiday Inn! That's exactly right!
It was amazing.
Right.
Again.
Do you own a car?
Well...
Yeah...fine.
Well, guess what? I found Betty... where she's been, anyway.
I'm not telling.
Where? Where is she?
Zerzura, the White City of Acacias, the Oasis of Little Birds. As me about the scent of acacia - it's in this room. I can smell it. The taste of tea so black it falls into your mouth. I can taste it. I'm chewing the mint. Is there sand in my eyes? Are you cleaning sand from my ears?
What?
I can already see.
Not the window - I can't bear the light anyway - no, I can see all the way to the desert. I've found the lost fossils.
I looked at them. They're shrubs, small trees. Exquisite. And fossilized, rock hard. He walks away to the nose of the plane.
I was talking about the girl.
Cut the ropes. I left a note, on his blanket. At the next Geographical Society I shall await with great interest the announcement of the Fenelon-Barnes Slave Knot. The Girl wouldn't leave, of course. Her father had sold her for a camel. He turns over the propeller, the engine cranks up.
Get out of here!
I also called Unsolved Mysteries.
It is their wish.
I give them back to the people... I make you Ninotchka the Great... Duchess of the People!... Grand Duchess of the People!
Yes, sweetheart.
Grace. I'd like to talk to you about your murdered brother Tim, if you feel up to it.
Oh, sure. Mr. Action Hero! Why couldn't I be Arnold Schwarzenegger's figment?
Where'd he go??
I am lighten. Can we drop this?
He's taking her to the land of Death, right? So all we've gotta do is...hitch a ride! Stop shaking! I'll protect you.
No.
Sounds great.
Hey. You feel like a cup of coffee?
Are you kidding? The last thing they expected was Mickey Knox to get up close and personal. They wanted a follow up episode and would've taken anything I had given them. I'm not gonna tell Mickey Knox that. I'm gonna make him think his grey matter depends on it. When I told Woody and the brass about this coup, they practically shit a brick. I'm talkin' an adobe brick. They want to expand the show to a hour, and they want it on immediately.
There's some lilac oil, you want some, a vanilla candle under the sink.
And when is the next lesson?
You've missed this bit.
I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you. Dorothy is really my daughter. You see, it was Spring in Venice, and I was so young. I didn't know what I was doing. We were all like that on my father's side.
We're at the Normandie for a couple of weeks. Why don't you drop around?
What boy likes you?
If you like 'em like that.
I mean since then.
Like they do on TV?
You're just jealous it was me in the trunk with her and not you.
We've got to get you out of here.
I know, darling, I'm sorry.
My head swells up like a watermelon and I drop dead.
You're right.
You're wearing the thimble.
That's the scar where I stabbed you! Oh God... You deliberately took me down there so you could... God, I can't believe it!
It was you... That night in the tunnels. You. You did this to me.
What was I? Your idea of a fuckin' hors d'oeuvre? Huh?
I've been dreaming about a hot bath for the last six months. Soak the prison off me.
Here. Eat your head off.
I wasn't gone more than a minute. Just went out to find you something to eat.
What's got into you?
Please, just promise me you ll do that. You have to promise, Kate. Because if you don t, then it s like it never happened and I don t think I could live with that.
There's one nice thing about being rich - you ring a bell and things happen. When the servant comes in, Mr. Hallor, I'm going to ask him to show you to the door. Many people don't know where it is.
Right.
That's very nice of Mr. Cobb - but I don't want anybody sticking to my tail no matter what.
I think Wally will be fine, Mrs. Worthington--he seems indestructible to me.
Uh... sure.
I think what Mr. Daniels is trying to say, Jack, is --
All right, Grandma
I'm afraid she's right, Mrs. Schuyler. I'm really very sorry, Mrs. Schuyler, that you feel this way. I was in hopes that you would like me. I'm not the burglar that you think I am. After all, we're married. I think the thing to do is to kiss and make up - Mother.
Oh no, no, it's... it's wonderful. It's... no, don't worry about it. You're very funny. Go back, that's great!
This whole idea -- this date and everything. It was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.
I have an apartment. I don't remember exactly where. My dog knows, though.
That's right, work it out.
How many people go here?
Hi there.
Take it easy how mad you make me, I'm the only dad you've got.
How does someone get meningitis?
... or lemme guess -- toxic waste?
Fine. I'll drop 'em off tomorrow afternoon.
Mm-hm.
Look, we don't care if you bring in the state milita, the volunteer fire department, the L.A. Thunderbirds, the ghost of Steve McQueen, and the twelve Roman gladiators, so long as we get credit for the bust.
Hello?
Charlotte, who?
Space?
From?
No gas.
Gas.
I want to be good to you -- madly good.
Grusinskaya --
You do believe that I really love you?
My girl back home. We're supposed to get married after I get my wings. She was Tommy's girl. They were engaged to be married before he died. I should've told you about her. I don't know why I didn't, except I didn't want you to think I was a shit for making it with Lynette.
I'm not your folks, man. You love this... Susan?
Thanks for covering for me.
No problem, but who's Susan?
I admit he is very clever. Three times he slipped through our fingers. In Paris he continued his activities. We intend not to let it happen again.
Of course, one must admit he has great courage.
Are my eyes really brown?
Victor Laszlo published the foulest lies in the Prague newspapers until the very day we marched in, and even after that he continued to print scandal sheets in a cellar.
Not particularly. I understand the point of view of the hound, too.
In this case, you have no sympathy for the fox, huh?
My interest in whether Victor Laszlo stays or goes is purely a sporting one.
This "... Of what I call God and fools can Nature." Who wrote that?
You get used to it.
Take the drill back to Honza at the office, I promised to get it back for the weekend and I don't want to show my face there.
Good, and then type up a notice on your computer for tonight's thing, photocopy it and put it up in all the faculty buildings and a couple of the pubs. It'll start at eight o'clock and the bar will be open from seven. Holly and I'll go and get some beer and wine. Can you bankroll the bar for tonight?
Shit no, it'll be twice cost.
Uhh sweetie, I wou... I wou...I wou...
A man is assaulting a woman at one two five west ninth street. Second floor rear. Make it fast.
Don't you know?
So how do we know that car's still in Fair Oaks?
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.
Ah, well...
What if the killers didn't see her? You published her picture -- you're gonna get her killed!
You're lying!
No, we're bringing the community into the effort to find her.
That's bullshit, Sheriff! You think she's a suspect!
I spoke to Betty Sizemore yesterday. That's right. There's no doubt in my mind, folks... she's on the run. Whether or not she's mixed up in all this remains to be seen...
-- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
I'm terribly sorry.
My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
Good for you.
What does he do? Is he an actor?
Got it. Good tip.
Five thirty. Okay.
Maybe I should get a dog... no, it would just shit all over the house and I'd never clean it up.
You want to do this by yourself? How? You can't take care of Pilgrim all the --
What... Bo-... What about the magazine?
You've already made arrangements!?
I come home and you tell me we're going to drive a psychotic horse to Montana! I can't just pick up and leave...
No. It's, uh... No, I really don't think it's a good idea
Yes, sir.
Mr. Gower, I think . . .
Is it a charge, sir?
Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
You want to watch some television?
Avast, there, Captain Cook! Where you headin'?
Just between you and me, I never intended taking it off.
If you'll be good enough to remove those newspapers I'll have a seat.
Huh?
The Sheriff says we shouldn't touch anything,
First door on your left!
On the ledge?
It's the first door on your left!
I can't find it, mon!
No, you must come, Jeanne -- we need you -- so much has happened since you left... I have a new horse now, a white one, just like yours... and La Hire hardly swears at all anymore... You can't stay -- they'll burn you!
Hello, Katmandu.
I came over to the bed and you smelled so good, like you just woke up, slightly sweaty. And I climbed on the bed with you and you said something like --
I loved you so much this day. On my bed in your panties. I remember I thought, how impossibly lucky am I to have you on my bed in your panties.
That's not a laugh! I mean a laugh from the heart. Now let's see. I'm going to tell you a funny story. Just a moment... I've got it! Well, it seems there were a couple of Frenchmen who went to America...
No, I can't leave you. I won't. Not yet. Not until I've made you laugh... at least once.
Because we are an odd couple.
At anything. At the whole ludicrous spectacle of life. At people being pompous and taking themselves seriously and exaggerating their own importance. If you can't find anything else to laugh at you can laugh at you and me.
Just smile.
Well, I had a car, and it was right here. I guess somebody moved it.
I hear six.
Some people are going out of here. What if I told you where and when?
Oh. Well, the clothes for instance. They were carefully preserved, and the body was just as carefully destroyed. The person who killed him counted on one thing... that all skeletons look alike.
Huh?
Several things. Hello, Fred. We're hungry again. Yeah, and lots of onions. Oh, and coffee.
Okay. Then you can be of use.
I'm worried about him, he's worried about me, I ride my bike to school, he follows in the car, like I'm not supposed to know he's there. Now it's Christmas, and you know what happens to people at Christmas.
I've been pretty sad, but I think my dad is worse.
She died.
No.
Great.
May I walk with you a ways?
You knew that man?
How's that?
About what?
This is your plan, Finch?
Dude, watch me work. They go for sensitive studs like me.
Yeah.
What the fuck are you doing here?
This place is an untapped resource. Check it out, dude, these vocal jazz girls are hot.
That's where your talent lies.
Yeah. How long have you been here?
Which you inferred was replaced by the D-6, which must have been a spare.
What did you say?
Oh, no, no, that's bullshit, Max. He goes with that girl over there.
I think he has a little thing for Annie.
You like this house, Max?
What difference does that make?
Whee, you shoulda told me it was Tony Lacey's party.
I even brought a road map to get us to the bathroom.
M'hm.
Right.
Kat, I'm in paradise. I don't ever want to leave.
What did you say?
Great. Let's say nine o'clock here tomorrow. Catch you later partner.
I'm sorry but it's been a crazy evening. I'm going to make that place into something big. God, I love you!
Let's walk over the bridge, we haven't done that for a while.
Nonsense, we can pick up the tram on the other side, it won't take any longer. Come on!
No, sir.
Now?!
Highly, highly overrated.
My date's a flute-toting band dork. That answer your question?
Alright, how do you guys stand? Well, Finch, I know where you are, but you can't use that as an excuse. Jim?
Buffums?
... weeks.
Oh, and your line to Charles Atlas in there: "I'll take that gun", "You'll have to".
Yes. My best friend.
Oh, I don't know. You have to get to know him. He doesn't say much but when he does you know he means it. He's sincere.
Sure. It's fine.
Maybe next summer he's going to take me hunting with him--and fishing. I want him to teach me how and I bet he won't get mad if I goof. His name's Jim. It's really James but he likes Jim more. People he really likes--he lets call him "Jamie."
Try.
Why not?
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
I thought you said I wasn't going to see her.
It's just five minutes. She comes in. You wave to the press. She leaves.
Yeah, but the First Lady... Couldn't we start with a cousin or something?
She hardly ever sees him and it'll be so fast, she won't have a chance to tell.
Be a professional. If you can convince her - - you can convince anybody.
... Alright.
Now when she comes in, we'll move you right out to the balcony. All you have to say is thanks for doing this, Ellen.'
Zeena...
You really are incredible...
Here s the thing. I really hadn t planned on giving you your...uh... anniversary gift until tonight. You know, anniversary s good all day...
I know that, but...
I'm sure he believed every word.
Well, what are you talking about? I just told you I was gonna get a
What do you mean, too bad?
Y-yeah. Gee, doggone it, I never thought about that. Gosh!
Just a little nickname. Yep, they're my kids and they're all I need. After working together these past coupla years, we're like well-oiled machinery. No, more like a Formula race car. No, scratch that one, too. What we're really like is a Swiss watch. Small, intricate, compact...it shouldn't work as well as it does, but it does. Because of the craftsmanship, the expertise, and the artist's loving hand.
Scott, genius cameraman, Roger, magician with sound. Unruly Julie, I could sooner do without my arm than Unruly Julie.
You met the kids I have working for me? Great bunch, aren't they?
Oh yes, indeed. Top flight.
Yeah.
My mother is dying. When she is dead, I'll come back and we'll be married.
A week. Two weeks. No more.
Must it be so definite? Can't we just say that we will be married when I get back?
Alright. A month. In a month.
Two weeks from tomorrow.
You mean when are you going to Egypt?
You're going.
You got to be in the Army, you might as well have something slick to drive.
Andersonville. They did horrible things to men there...
Did you know the most brutal, inhumane prison of the entire war was in Georgia?
Even Robert E. Lee was a loser.
Jeb Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis -- they're all losers in my book.
You know, it's interesting. The South lost the Civil War, but they still seem to get all the glory.
Uncle Louis, this is my friend Johana.
I brought Johana to meet you.
A.W.O.L.?
I'll think of a way to sell, them. One day.
I'm not going.
You mean, you know who this baby belongs to?
I sold some drawers and socks, too; I'm throwing those in.
Shell-shocked!
That's typical of your daughter. Takes those things for granted. Why does she think I lugged her all the way from Miami for the love of it?
Yeah.
If I didn't I wouldn't be here! I've got it all itemized.
Oh, she does, huh? Isn't that sweet of her! You don't , I suppose.
I smack 'em hard on the shell an' they get... What?
I loved you, Madeleine.
And the necklace. Carlotta's necklace. That was your mistake, Judy. One shouldn't keep souvenirs of a killing. You shouldn't have been that sentimental.
Listen, did you want to make love?
I think I should go back.
Because I just am not drunk enough or stoned enough to make that happen right now.
Have sex. Y'know --
I'm sorry. I just wanted to say that. This seems like the perfect romantic exotic place to do it and --
You must help us, Leon... if you don't win her over we're on our way to Siberia!
If I could get into a game I might win some.
I would be awfully glad to oblige, you've been so decent to me. Three hundred?
Bless you --
Yes -- I will be on the train.
What?
If the Baron -- if you would permit me --
Absolutely true, Kringelein and I have to raise some money immediately.
Was the Baron joking, or is it really true that the Baron is -- in financial straits.
Hey, business is business.
He had to come quickly. It was a big leak.
You're a heavy sleeper, Frank. You've always-been a heavy sleeper. Unlike me.
I guess I ... If I jumped to...
I want no more trouble, Mr. Fennyman. As I explained to you, the theatre business
It's easy for you to talk. You're retired. We're still working.
Say, Hildy, if I know you, you sound pretty anxious to get rid of us. Are you trying to scoop us or something?
Something smells around here. If you ask me Mollie gave her the story on how Williams got that gun. Did you smuggle that gun into Williams, Mollie?
Better let us in on it, Mollie.
Oh, you two are pals now -- I think you're right, Endicott. Mollie did give her some kind of story.
Naomi, I really value our relationship. I hope it's possible for us to stay in touch.
I did it. I guess that means something.
Oh boy oh God oh crap oh no.
But, but -- what would I do?
You know, Jim...you could go back there...and...
No, you're stupid. Get going! Right now! She's primed!
That's stupid.
Anything! Just tell her it looks like she needs an extra hand or something.
You've been there before. You've seen it.
Madeleine, a hundred miles south of San Francisco there's an old Spanish Mission, Mission San Juan Bautista. It's been preserved exactly as it was a hundred years ago as a museum. Now, think hard, darling. You've been there before. You've seen it!
....what....?
Miss Vivian.
Yes, gentlemen. Saturday after next, I lose my amateur standing and turn pro.
All right, gentlemen, I'm not gonna sugar-coat this thing. I've known you guys since grade school, so I'm gonna give it to you straight from the hip... right from the shoulder... without beating around the bush... Nothing fancy, just the plain, hard facts... tell it like it is.
Okay... This is it... I'm getting married.
What?
I'm well aware of how pleasant the weather is in Rome at the present time thank you.
Say, David...
Explain to me how you can diagnose someone as "obsessive compulsive disorder" and then act like I have any choice in barging in.
You said you could help me -- what was that -- a tease?
You changed the room around...
Shhhhhhh. I don't have this mountain of available time... I got to get to my restaurant on time. Do you know how hard it is for me to be here?
For the whole night?
Neither do I. A hundred bucks an hour though. That's pretty stiff.
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.
What is it, Miss Vivian?
You're going to have to do it right here, Schaeffer.
See you in jail.
Look, look at that guy.
You know, and the miserable is everyone else. That's-that's all. So- so when you go through life you should be thankful that you're miserable, because that's- You're very lucky... to be... ...to be miserable.
I don't-don't know how they get through life. It's amazing to me.
And blind people, crippled...
...you know, they're- The-the horrible would be like, uh, I don't know, terminal cases, you know?
Shoot.
Tomorrow?
Yeah.
So you think the dissertation will get published?
I'm sorry. I really shouldn't have --
And buys a deadly poison. He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death. He drinks the poison. He dies by her side. And then she wakes and sees him dead.
That's me.
I couldn't hear you. How are you?
Would you please calm down. Tell me what happened.
I have not said all. By malign fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the Friar's plan. He hears only that Juliet is dead. And thus he goes to the Apothecary.
Oh yeah? What was 'fascinating' about it?
We're already getting complaints about frivolous search.
Good morning, I was talking kind of loud there, sorry.
Thought you were going to turn in, Inspector.
Good night!
Good night, Mrs. Brett!
Why?
You know what I'd do, if I were you--before the card game I'd go to the Purser's office.
In America they'd bring only a penny. I guess that's about all they're worth.
Who are you really? And what were you before? What did you do and what did you think? Huh?
Here's looking at you, kid.
Well, I don't think I can remember it.
You played it for her and you can play it for me.
Yes, boss.
If she can stand it, I can. Play it!
Not a question of if you can -- you are. Just keep your eyes on the road and your foot on the pedal and the rest will take care of yourself.
Where did you get Pilgrim from?
That must have been pretty special.
Getting old. Not being of much use, I guess. What went on out there, Grace? With Pilgrim?
Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
Why don't you relax, Frankie?
Well, you got your circulation. Now, why don't you let me alone?
Look, it started as a circulation stunt, didn't it?
Say, let's get something straight here. I don't want any part of this thing. If you've got an idea I'm going around lecturing to people, why you're crazy! Baseball's my racket, and I'm sticking to it. Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.
Me?
I think you added the "brutal."
Look, I don't want a --
Everything's on the fucking run! Everything --
Tell you what -- I'd prefer loyalty..
Like fuck you are.
I don't want anybody buying up my life's work and turning it into something it wasn't meant to be. A man wants to leave something behind. And he wants it left behind the way he made it. And he wants it to be run the way he run it -- with a sense of honor, of dedication, of truth. Okay?
Why?
Something, huh? All those bids.
Barry? Barry knows about this?
Fine. I'm only here a couple of more days and I'm not going to spend them fighting with you.
Trying to say something, Martin?
Now you're talkin'!
Right!--but it doesn't have to apply to you--Keep your eyes open for anybody wearing a lot of cracked ice and give me the office.
Hurry up.
Maybe they will.
Pleasure first if it don't interfere with business.
Shortie!--you know my motto?
What??
I don't care if you've been after her for six years! Butch, our whole lives are at stake! Are you going to let a woman come between us after all we've been through?
I guess you haven't heard from her yet.
-- yeah, this is --
Who? Hello, Butch! Where are you?
What are you doing there? Haven't you even started?
Oh, for -- H. Sebastian -- Butch! Listen, it's a matter of life and death! Listen!
I can't hear... You got who? Speak up! A what?... You can't stop for a dame now!
No.
My Lady Cosgrove's relationship with me was a singular one. Her life was passed in a series of crack-brained sort of alternation between love and hatred for me. We would quarrel for a fortnight, then we should be friends for a month together sometimes. One day, I was joking her, and asking her whether she would take the water again, whether she had found another lover, and so forth. She suddenly burst out into tears, and, after a while, said to me:
Nah. Don't sweat it.
For real. I should be alone, anyway.
What's so great about baseball?
Felt his liver go on that last One. Get him to a doctor or he'll Be dead in a couple hours.
Put it in your mouth.
Hey... Popeye's chicken is ass kickin'!
I also have this odd pain in my mid section. Kind of a hollow feeling...
You're on Earth now, kid. Gonna have the same physical needs and limitations a human has. We'll stop by K-mart. Get you some warm clothes.
So far, so good. Now what?
That pain is hunger.
I got energy up the ying-ying. Let's get cracking!
It sure is. Now eat it up. You're gonna need your energy.
But why shouldn't I?
Well why is she a big taboo subject all of a sudden?
Well -- I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date and find out what's --
Well look. I have no intention of taking her out.
I was just kidding around.
Bombers.
I take it back, about the flowers. We're all gonna die.
I'd rather not play. I want to listen and learn that way.
He hasn't called?
Don't let this talk of heroes upset you, Jack. Sigurd's sword is no great thing. The Volsung killed Fafnir. You killed Lindfarne. That's one worm apiece... I'd say you and Sigurd were neck-and-neck.
Half for doing what?
You'd always go sit in a plane whenever you were upset.
Shit O dear, that's enough to make me asthmatic. The nerve of those twits. What do they know about female odor? Don't interrupt. Here's my concept. My ranch out West? It's a beauty ranch. Oh, it's got a few head of cattle for atmosphere and tax purposes. But it's a beauty ranch, a place where unhappy women -- divorcees and widows, mainly -- can go to lose weight, remove wrinkles, change their hair styles and pretty themselves up for the next disappointment. My ranch is named the Rubber Rose, after the Rubber Rose douche bag, my own invention, and bless its little red bladder, the most popular douche bag in the world. So get this. It's on the migratory flight path of the whooping cranes. The last flock of wild whooping cranes left in existence. Well, these cranes stop off at my little pond -- Siwash Lake, it's called -- twice a year, autumn and spring, and spend a few days each time, resting up, eating, doing whatever whooping cranes do. I've never seen them, understand, but I hear they're magnificent. Very big specimens -- I mean, huge mothers -- and white as snow, to coin a phrase, except for black tips on their wings and tail feathers, and bright red heads. Now, whooping cranes, in case you didn't know it, are noted for their mating dance. It's just the wildest show in nature. It's probably the reason why birdwatching used to be so popular with old maids and deacons. Picture these rare, beautiful, gigantic birds in full dance -- leaping six feet off the mud, arching their backs, flapping their wings, strutting low to the ground. Dears, it's overwhelming. And picture the birds doing their sex dance on TV. Right there on the home screen, creation's most elaborate sex ritual -- yet clean and pure enough to suit the Pope. With lovely Sissy Hankshaw in the foreground. In a white gown, red hood attached, and big feathery sleeves trimmed in black. In a very subdued imitation of the female whooping crane, she dance walks over to a large nest in which there sits a can of Yoni Yum. And a can of Dew. Off-camera, a string quartet is playing Debussy. A sensuous voice is reading a few poetic lines about courtship and love. Are you starting to get it? Doesn't it make the hair on your neck stand up and applaud? My very goodness gracious! Grandiose, lyrical, erotic and Girl Scout- oriented; you can't top it. I've hired a crew of experts from Walt Disney Studios, the best wildlife cinematographers around. You're my eternal favorite. Princess Grace herself couldn't be better, not even if she had your personality which she doesn't; Anyway, dear, I'm out of photography now and into water colors. Ah how circuitous conversation is! We're back at the beginning. The exact man I've wanted you to meet is my artist the watercolorist.
Not here--follow me around the shed.
Don't you know better than to talk to me with people around?
I saw how it has to be.
I thought you were a smart guy.
If I was smart I wouldn't be working my way over on this ship.
My tail itches.
Lawyer here?
Baby...you're asking the wrong guy.
You don't have that one, do you?
No, it's the recipe for spaghetti "Frutti del mare". You see I was right in getting you out here. You're a world champion, my friend!
September '97, that's all she wrote.
Yeah, enormous.
I have no idea. Finch showers in a bathing suit.
No -- it's true. He is...really... big.
Very.
He look familiar?
Anybody says anything bad about Millie, I'll break his neck.
Hey, guys, I got a game to pitch.
C'mon. Get the hookers in a circle. We better put Cochise out of business.
He said his chakras were jammed and he was breathing out of the wrong nostril.
What's wrong?
I'm nervous--my old man's here.
What's happening?
We're going to have some fun. Remember fun? We're going to have some of it. Okay?
Well, yeah, that's part of it. Woman finds out how I live, that I'm not a published author, that I'm a liar essentially, then yeah, any interest is gonna evaporate real quick. If you don't have money at my age, you're not even in the game. You're just a pasture animal waiting for the abattoir.
Is an abattoir like a... like a... what is that?
Slaughterhouse.
Abattoir. Huh. But you are going to get the good news this week about your book. I know you are. I can feel it.
How old are you?
You really are a very beautiful girl.
Because they bring out the flavor of the champagne.
Vivian... the meter's running... cooperate.
What did you say?
He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
You're a horrible person, Barry. I mean it.
I'm sorry, Rob, that's, it's --
Ooh. Drag.
It was Jan, and it was a long time after--
-- It was Dean, you fucking idiot.
Did you know that after that song was recorded, Jan himself crashed his --
Okay, okay -- "Leader of the Pack." The guy fucking cracks up on a cycle and dies right? "Dead Man's Curve," Jan and Dean...
Fuck off, Barry.
Whatever. Okay. "Tell Laura I Love Her." That'd bring the house down. Laura's mom could sing it.
Jimmy, how's the -
Sorry. I thought I was doing quite well.
You know I'm scared of heights.
Up there they wouldn't be a problem.
What?
I was talkin' with ya man, Mike. -- Hey, how come I been put outta my locker?
Having fun.
Driving?
They're both a challenge.
Maybe yes. Maybe no.
Where did you hear that?
Well... it's true.
Everybody loves Lisa. Everybody loves Lisa. But everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.
Why?
Shit, yeah. White Boy even got busted for it. White Boy, tell these boys the reason you went down on that burglary that time.
Break and enter, shit. Take it and git, how it's done. Don't waste any time. That's how you do it.
Yeah--
That what they're wearing these days to break and enter?
This is it. Yeah. This is really-- HOLLY Well, wo-would you be willing to-to read it? Something...that I wrote?
You've always hated my taste in the past.
I'm excited, too. Oh, and I wanted to give you this. It's a little... thing.
Who was this fuckin' guy?
Rock and roll, Gus. Johnny Boz.
I never heard of him.
Before your time, pop. Mid-sixties. Five or six hits. He's got a club down in the Fillmore now.
I'm not anymore. I haven't, I haven't been in television for a year.
Yes indeed. Fuck! They're erasing you, Clem!
The word for those things is croissants.
What did you study?
Oh, what do you do with that?
It takes a while to figure it out. I'm sure you will, though.
Thanks.
I know, and the magician's goal is to find his true self. But what's this got to do with it?
A man who could love -- that is all, who has forgotten everything else for you.
You mustn't talk Russian to me.
Am I quite strange to you?
I never knew it was so dangerous to hide in a woman's room when she's alone.
Okay, seeya. Vada?
All right! Carl! Frank! One of you get on each side of the desk. Take hold of the cover.
No. I haven't. Have you?
Do you want to get us scooped?
Call Duffy!
As a matter of fact, I'm a huge fan.
He wants a reconciliation.
How did she meet him? Did Dad know? Anything else in that envelope?
Guy cracks walnuts with his asshole.
Wait a minute! That was thirty years after daddy. Do you think...?
This happened way before we both got married. I... I can't believe it. You think she had sex with him?
Don't talk to me like that. She was my mother for Christsakes. And now I find out she was... She was a --!
Well, what am I supposed to think?
Forget it.
Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
Romeo! Romeo!
Forget it.
Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover! I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes, By her high forehead and her scarlet lip, By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh! O, Romeo that she were An open ass, and thou a poperin pear! Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed; This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep.
I'm not certain, my dear, but I believe your husband has somehow psychically diverted the route.
I'm afraid that no physical harm must come to him as long as he inhabits the vessel.
Appreciate it, sir.
Ah, yes... I suppose sooner or later we ought to fuck.
That's fine. Thanks. I'll look 'em over later.
Sera... I hope that you understand how I feel about this. First of all, you're welcome to my money. We can buy a couple of cases of liquor and you can have the rest. But I don't think you're talking to me right now about money.
Well, thanks, I - uh How do you do? What is your name?
Because... it's better for me that way. OK?
...and I'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. We know I'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. And I know that you're a hooker. I hope you understand that I'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that I'm indifferent or that I don't care... I do... it simply means that I trust and accept your judgement. What I'm saying is... that I hope you understand that I understand.
No. I think you're talking about you. I'll tell you right now that I'm in love with you... but, be that as it may, I'm not here to force my twisted life into your soul.
What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
I never saw that before.
I sprint the last quarter mile. You gentlemen don't have to keep up if you don't care to.
Thank you.
It's OK. Don't worry about it. Accidents happen.
Had a close one, eh?
You know who?
Not at all. I, this guy here, he's Sonny Chiba.
I don't believe in fighting.
You know how you sound, Monsieur Blaine? Like a man who's trying to convince himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. Each of us has a destiny, for good or for evil.
Take the first shot at me.
Yeah. I'm fine. It didn't hurt.
Yes, I get the point.
Hit me in the chest with this...
Saturn. Beautiful.
What is that?
Throw it. C'mon, right in the chest.
If there isn't I've just wasted the last six months.
Yeah. How about that? People start digging holes in this county, there's no telling what'll come up.
Business is booming. Got your drugs, got your illegals--had a shooting the other night at Big O's--Soldier got ventilated.
I've seen pictures.
Open late.
I don't know. What do you feel like doing?
My mother, boy, she drives me crazy.
So what do you feel like doing tonight?
Angie, I'm thirty-four years old. I been looking for a girl every Saturday night of my life. I'm tired of looking. Everybody's always telling me to get married. Get married. Get married. Don't you think I wanna get married? I wanna get married. They drive me crazy. Now, I don't wanna wreck your Saturday night for you, Angie. You wanna go somewhere, you go ahead. I don't wanna go.
My old lady, every word outta her mouth, when you gonna get married?
Boy, you're getting to be a real drag, you know that?
Hey, Sam.
Come on over about half past seven, we'll think of something. Hello, Ma, what's the matter?
So don't marry him.
So you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella.
It is that simple.
You've been with someone!
Okay, I get it.
She would not sleep with me the other night, you know, it's-
Sheila? Yes she was. Is. Was.
Yes.
Oh, Christ! What's wrong with you?!
Hardly ever. Maybe three times a week.
Well, we never have any laughs anymore, is the problem.
Hey. A new plaintiff called, wants to meet you. I told him we'd be out there Thursday.
Cool.
You heard me.
Then?
From whom?
I want you and Tommy to stay with my mother.
D'you have to say "fucking" every other word?
Bill's birthday is the day after tomorrow. There is a provisory by- law in our charter. Per the discre- tion of the Board, Corporate off- icers can be retired at age sixty- five.
Oh, please, Swana! I don't know whether I'm standing on my head or my heels. Here you are blaming me for neglecting you when I'm trying to concentrate on another woman and can't get near her.
Make it ice cold.
I don't feel like any breakfast.
Everything O.K.?
You're the President. Come in! Your brother was just telling me a few jokes I can use on the radio--
One source referred to it as a five billion dollar metal sculpture to ugly to look at and too big to bury.
Okay, billion...right, of course. They told me I could have any producer I wanted -- and I want you.
The House Armed Service Committee has a secret report which says that the General Stillwell tank the Army has dumped a fortune into plain won't work. I have it cold, confirmed. They have five million dollars in this thing already.
So the woman's married. She goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. But you don't reveal her name, you protect her. It sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. Like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.
I think you should. I have to run down to the grocery anyway -- all that's left around here is one frozen pizza -- I'll be right back -- okay?
-- Mr. Sheldrake.
There's a call for you --
Like what? Put yourself in my place, Baxter -- how can I help her -- my hands are tied --
Fran, why did you do it? It's so childish -- and it never solves anything -- I ought to be very angry with you, scaring me like that -- but let's forget the whole thing -- pretend it never happened -- what do you say, Fran? Fran --
Are you there, Fran?
How to die, mostly.
So... you want to work for a winery or something someday?
I do have a copy of the manuscript in the car. It's not fully proofed, but if you're okay with a few typos...
My palate's kind of shot, but from what I can tell, I'd dub it pretty damn good.
How's the birthday girl?
You'll see.
So what'd we get her?
Oh, so the bitch escaped.
No... damn... you... Oh shut up, you overrated sack of shit.
General Osvaldo Tamarindo y Ramirez. Telefono 666.
In what capacity?
You need help with your kids? I could probably do that.
Yeah, I don't want it. Um, thank you very much. You're very kind.
Yes, Mr. Dobisch.
You've always had good taste in husbands, so...
Why not?
Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
Can I come in?
Could you handle it if it was in a good cause?
I had a better idea, we'll burn them. There's a drum across the road; I was just waiting for the workers to go home.
Have you ever stolen anything?
Well, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
Jesus, Jane. How long have you been here?
Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! Give me my sin again.
Is she a Capulet?
Hi, Aaron...What's doing?
I bullshitted him.
Jeanne...! Are you alright?
...Can't do it.
But I mean really... wonderfully... great.
Oh.
Kay.
Hey, you wanna test my limits, you better line up a couple dozen women on the GROUND...cause I got NO limits in the air!
Didn't you say test the limits?
Don't be an idiot! You're in no fit state to go anywhere.
I've got my duties to attend to.
Jackie, would you argue with your doctor.
They said you were drunk. Why don't you tell her the truth?
And she sent no word down?
What are you doing?!
She'll think it's her fault for keeping me.
You've got three broken ribs, man!
Refreshing.
Duets? But can we trust him?
Yes. What's he doing here?
Thinks it's terrific. Says for us to go the limit. Wants us to build a bonfire under every big shot in the state.
Well, maybe you're right.
I trust him.
Him?
The Stratford.
Did you know Noah Goldstein?
You saw all the reports, Beth!
She didn't hand you to me. She doesn't even know who you are. She told me about Lisa Henderson.
Why did you change your name?
Don't you ever have any problems?
Okay, Dennis.
You really will?
Last zoo we were in was... Beijing, yeah? Sure. The rhinos were fucking.
It's weird being the groom. All these things Kimmy has to take care of...
What... does he... look like?
Oh, I don't want to keep them waiting any longer. They're important people. I wish you'd go along with me, Cobb. They're all strangers to me.
Well, what about it, Mr. Deeds?
You'll excuse me, won't you? I'll be right back.
Gee, I'm busy. Did the opera people always come here for their meetings?
Uh-huh.
That's funny. Why is that?
Why do mice go where there's cheese?
No, I'm all right.
It's this darned corset. It binds. He retrieves the stick.
From that music.
I'm having one now.
Nice car.
Yeah, and my mother was a saint. For fifteen years the whole damn town knew he had another woman on the side. Stole ten thousand dollars to set her up in business. But hell, what's that? You got a problem? Buddy'll fix it. Facing some time in jail? Buddy'll knock half of it off-- if you do what he says, when he says. You got some business that's not exactly legal? Talk to Buddy--
Imonna find out one way or the other.
Buddy Deeds was a murderer.
I guess living up here makes people look older.
And Lord we ask finally that you send an angel to look after and protect our beloved son, Adam. Amen.
You mean about that gun?
You re so...beautiful...
Is this because of your dad?
Elliot.
Oh yeah. Mr. By-the-book, Stick-Up-the-Ass, My- Way-or-the-Highway Death. Believe me - over the course of eternity, you get pretty damned tired of that schtick. So I need a job. He sticks me in this broke-down amusement park, with a buncha animals to run it. I'm supposed to be grateful?
They'll be along.
Where's everybody else?
I gotta go out for a while.
Couldn t Nazi hunters do the job?
No, no.
What??
Months, Swana.
It is what I want. But I don't want to spend the next ten years in jail. I don't want you guys to go to jail. We don't know what could be waiting for us up there. It'll probably be just what it's supposed to be. The only thing that's waiting for us is two hundred thousand dollars. I'm just looking at the downside.
That's where trouble comes into paradise. But the boss let's you borrow some money if you need it. Wanna see what "Spiderman" number one looks like?
I don't want ya cleanin' nobody else's cages no more.
Westley didn't reach his destination. His ship was attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who never left captives alive. When Buttercup got the news that Westley was murdered --
This is true love. You think this happens every day?
Of course you will.
Hear this now: I will come for you.
Yeah, I got the key, so I come here at night, hang out, read comic books, play music.
Where are you taking her?
What did it say?
Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too?
You were lying.
And you didn't come up here to see her.
So you didn't go to school together.
Michael's.
What?
Are you still in love with me?
It's a full moon. Where is he?
Oh dear girl, your extracurricular activities are of no consequence to me. I don't give a damn who you sleep with. I'm concerned about David.
Come to my office, Miss Price.
What?
You may as well invite her here.
Nah. I haven't dribbled a ball in four and a half months. Maybe I miss some of the attention, but besides that...
Will you be okay?
Thanks, I needed that.
Right. Ahm... the film's great... and I just wondered -- whether you ever thought of having more... horses in it?
Don't worry about your little pin cushion. To be honest, I'm looking forward to having the place to myself.
You do it then.
"My dear Regina: I hope you are enjoying your holiday. Megeve can be so lovely this time of year. The days pass very slowly and I hope to see you soon. As always, Charles. P.S. Your dentist called yesterday. Your appointment has been changed." Not very much, is it?
We took the liberty of calling your dentist -- we thought, perhaps, we would learn something.
Did you?
Yes. Your appointment has been changed. One key to your apartment -- one comb -- one fountain pen -- one toothbrush -- one tin of tooth powder -- that is all.
If you will sign this list you may take the things with you.
Is that all? Can I go now?
One more question. Is this your husband's passport?
Of course it is.
And this?
I don't understand.
Yeah you do.
Have fun.
Yours.
I'm feeling real uncomfortable right now because the guy who reports to me is threatening me.
I think it's time you went home, Drew.
Okay, he's just a Wilbur then.
What do you think the Board is going to say when I tell them that?
I don't care.
When the lock is broken -- yes.
With all due respect, you damn well better care because if you try to stonewall them again, there'll be blood on the floor.
Your logic is backward.
That's not what I heard.
Below the hard deck doesn't count. You guys are the second team, aren't you?
We won! Ice turns back, stares them down, then turns back into his locker, dismissing them.
It's got nothin' to do with you, Wyatt. It's-
So would I.
I don't want to make friends.
He's a wheel. So's she. It's hard to make friends with them.
What?
You shouldn't monkey with him.
Mmm.
Uh -- he's from out of town --
Just don't call him, Alan!
And how have you been feeling about your... work lately?
But what?
'Las Vegas, please. I do not speak English.' What is hitchhike?
I do not speak English.
What is hitchhike?
Tis the truth.
Yes?
The pepper, too?
You're tougher.
Wanted a look at your old man, huh?
I thought it was my turn.
Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
What did you call me, Mayo?
Zack, don't!
I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
But you might.
Your Honor, this is a tape from Miss Lawson's answering machine. I would like to play it now.
Am I interrupting anything?
Nothing to do with me? I'm your Brother for Christ's sake. God, I Don't believe this. Talk to him, will you? Or hit him. Oh no, don't tell me...
Let me help. We don't want all this shit cluttering up our lives.
Martin, can't you just deal with this yourself?
...Well, I'm not sure where I --
Good afternoon to ya, this is Norville Barnes --
Don't bother to thank me, it's the easiest thing in the world. Matter of fact, I know where a vacancy just came up.
But look, I'm president of the company now and I --
Damn! How's it look?
He said - be careful.
You think so? Joyce says she's timid.
Joyce was screwing Del.
What's he want of you?
No! Not enough! In times like these, when everything is uncertain, every conservative person should have a substantial part of his fortune within arm's reach.
Baby - want you to meet Duff.
They get hair all over the place.
You ought to get rid of those dogs.
I'd like a drink.
It bit me! My leg! Jesus, it's down there, shoot it! Shoot it for Christ's sakes!
GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!
You work the system right, you could ask her yourself. Just be thankful you're not working for Household. The Queen never lets them out of her sight. But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy.
The good-looking one.
I'm not sure I do, Archie.
FOR GOD'S SAKES, LET ME OUT!!
You can't do jack shit... unless you learn your evil powers.
I told my mother you weren't the one who gave me the films. That it wasn't your fault. But I thought you said the film could catch fire just to scare me. Now that I know, I won't steal any more from you. That's all I wanted to say. I'm going.
I'm just saying, there's wickedness in you... I can tell from your snores.
Release the evil?
"But those are my roommate's sodas..." Does that sound like a statement the son of the devil would make?
Miserable Pecks.
Pack up. I'll see you get back to London.
I go in alone.
I don't know.
Wanted to tell me he didn't kill Julia Wolf.
I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
Hello, Violet. Hey, you look good. That's some dress you got on there.
It sure scares you, a guy like that - settin' out on his porch, doin' nothin'. I seen hundreds of them - all my life.
There isn't any. All this shit you got in here. What is all this stuff anyway? Handcuffs, chains... what's this can?
You comfy?
He paid the hospital bill when you were born. Your mom always calls you "our beautiful daughter" in the letters she wrote to him.
Fine, I'll fuck off, but not til I say something.
Yeah.
You want me to fuck off?
And now I'm paying for it, right? That what this is about? "I told you so?"
Quincy. I know you left school early to throw your middle finger up at me.
Good.
You will??
I don't know.
Because I guarantee she's married and has a couple kids. Girls like Mary don't stay single.
The poem?... The poem was great!
Hello, Bensinger.
I was having a little chat about you just this afternoon -- with our Mister Duffy.
I should say not! That was one swell story you had in the paper this morning.
You think that could possibly be a full time job? How many hair colors could there be?
I like it.
Yeah. Tom Waits says it in --
I can't remember.
I don't really know how --
I just wanted to say hi. Did you know I still don't know your name or where you work?
Oh, you-you have that one?
Oh, that's nice. I'd love to see her wind up settled. She's a tense one.
Taking care of people isn't a growth enterprise, Mr Sims. I hope you write that down in your report, I'd like your bosses to read it.
No.
Here, how's this?
My wife wears a seven. You don't look like a seven to me.
Just look. What do you wear? A nine?
We're not exactly silly with time, you know. Jack, you find anything?
Okay, okay. Here, how about this?
For more than forty years. So Madame told me.
And I have known the Lavals of Marseilles for more than thirty years.
And as you leave the foyer, there is a little niche.
Yeah.
I warned you yesterday.
Don't touch me! You can't touch me!
What are you doing?!
Where's Leeloo?
It's all my fault. I'm the servant... It's my mission! Here!
I am... except I've gotta do somebody at their house.
What are you trying to say to me, Fish?
Vindication. How would you like to get some? A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct.
The real story on Miss Carpenter.
All the gory details.
The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland.
It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again.
Well, thank you, that's great, but it's more than I bargained for. I just wanted to set the record straight.
I know it, son. But tonight's going to be even tougher.
M'sieu Laval, there are several things I've wanted to ask you for quite a while. I understand you are from Marseilles.
Great. What's the latest we can get there?
Huh.
Okay.
Little - couldn't be an automobile, could it? Well, well! Ain't that nice!
...We stood there and I kissed her for the last time. And she said, "If lose me, you'll know that I loved you --
Has he looked through it yet?
So, what now?
C'mon, c'mon, let's hurry this up.
Yeah. Isn't that a shame?
I hope so, too.
Like, normal style. The...missionary position.
I can't do it alone. I need you, to be Madeleine for a while. Then, when it's done, we'll both be free.
It just so happens we're not in Kansas anymore. Our little angel's father has accepted the new headmaster position at Oakwood. She's staying with my aunt up in Connecticut while Daddy sells his house. Can you imagine what this would do for my reputation? Screwing the new headmaster's virginal daughter before school starts? It will be my greatest victory.
That was just simple revenge. What I have planned requires sheer genius.
Oh come on, Kathryn. It's too easy. "But I thought high school was only four years." I mean, please. She knows nothing. She's seen nothing. I could have her under the table at Au Bar sucking me off before the appetizer arrived. Go get one of those moron friends of yours to do it. I have a reputation to uphold.
Oh yes. I've read it over and over again. This baby's the real deal. Daddy's little angel. A paradigm of chastity and virtue.
Nolan? I knew he had guts but
It's a miracle.
God--what a Big League move.
Party without me.
Eight and twenty-four.
Cause I can get a job. I will. And you can start leaving the kids with the chicken fat lady again. Would that make you happy?
You don't look comfortable here. That's 'cause you don't like being the center of attention, do you? Nah. You're like me.
No.
Huh. You know what I always wondered the way they say you guys'd take a bullet for the President.
What about it?
Well, is that really true? I mean, would you really get killed just to save his life.
You ever use it?
Aren't we stayin'?
Fuck!!
You're joking. You can't trust anyone these days.
No. I mean here you stand with one of nature's most awesome spectacles and the whole time you've had your back to it. Aren't you impressed?
That s why I work for Big Ed?
You seemed to be handling everything quite nicely.
It was only a scratch. Far more damaging to my trousers than to me.
Charles Street? In the Village? When we were living in Greenwich Village...? Great times. Why d we ever leave?
Which one is that? The ATF guy?
She sings? What does she sing?
You must chill! You must chill! I have hidden your keys. CHILL!
What do you want, a joke?
Nice, Barry.
Let's go and see. Taxi!
Maybe we'll come by tomorrow, help you clear up or something.
You do.
Uh, yeah. I'm a policeman.
Fifty years. The rep is known around Philly, an' a good rep can't be bought, but I don't have to tell you that.
You know... ...the guys who ride the short bus.
Some buildings I'm working on.
It's right there on your golf bag.
I work with retards.
Well, just until I get my PGA Tour card.
I'm kidding. Yeah, I guess you could call me an architect -- it's just a job really, a way to keep me moving. My real passion is my hobby.
Oh.
Has he gotten his mail today?
Freak luck is a strange thing.
Freak luck for sure.
Can I go?
What would you say, too fast...too quick...
A funny story?
Well, there were two Scotchmen. One was named McIntosh and one was named McGillicuddy. They met on the street.
You should be happy. What were you going to do for him when it ran out? He pulls out more phials from his jacket.
Supper. Hana calls after him.
Rabbit hunting.
Can you cook the rabbit or will you try and bring that back to life?
No, no, that's not what I said. He can keep his thumbs, but the fingers gotta go.
I mean everything. I don't know anything about how you -- how you work this. I don't know how you get out of the house at night. I don't know the risk involved.
Yes, Jimmy.
Now everybody sit down.
Hey, Dad, I'm almost finished laying down my monsters of metal compilation tape. I really think it's a masterpiece.
Okay, kid, we'll listen to it later.
Soon honey, soon.
Did you subsequently write a series of articles about him?
Straight down the drive, right at the hedgerow, follow the lane. Don't blink, you'll miss it.
You can make a mistake.
Don't get too cocky.
Jack Daniel's okay? It's gonna have to be.
Look, can I just borrow your car?! I promise it ll be returned!
It couldn't have been out at Glades, if that's what you're thinking. I was never out there.
Grace, Listen... you've got to do this. Just trust me one more time.
I am not a good singer.
You liked my singing?
That's your problem, George Bailey.
They couldn't wait to see you.
Who... are they?
This is the staff of the Bijou.
Oh. What... what time is it?
Six-thirty. I thought we'd get an early start.
Where did we put that wheelbarrow the Albino had?
-- Jesus --
You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to -- marriage license! Did you say -- ?
You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
You'd lie about anything.
Well, nobody asked me what I thought. They just hung it on me.
Oh, incidentally, my last name is Carruthers. Sounds a little too much like "druthers", doesn't it?
Well. I got some stuff to say. Guess I'm kind of lucky that way. Most people don't have anything on their minds, do they?
Well, I don't mind getting up early, so I got a job throwing garbage... I'm not in love with the stuff, okay.
Nah, I got me a job.
Hey, wait a minute. When am I going to see you again?
That ain't a gun any more. The firing pin's busted - the - Don't waste time talking about that.
Long story.
Man to man, I'm not.
Yes. Seriously.
Okay. Michelle, do you want to be my date for the prom?
What was your name again?
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
Whatever you want.
I don't know how you're gonna top that.
It's a bargain then. Anything you want to know?
What's this?
Little slow tonight.
You wanted to see me, Charlie?
I'm thinking it's too weird now.
I wasn't sure.
What's your deal with Alyssa?
You don't want to mess with me today. I'll figure something else out tomorrow.
You're taking him... yes... you're taking him -- this will clear the books. One night. You want to say "no" to me? Try... because I've never felt as nuts as I do right this second. I almost want you to try saying "no."
Thanks for looking after him.
I'm not saying nothing to you.
Everything's being done but it's not enough. I have to find something -- more.
The knife. What knife?
Then where's the lantern? And where's the knife?
My... the acrophobia.
You'll have to keep them anyway. The man at the Aquarium said that he wouldn't take them back.
Is that any way to talk to your ole partner? Look, it's only nine hundred miles each way.
That means we gotta average ninety- four miles per. Forget it.
No one's ever done it before. This'll put us on the map.
Or in the slammer.
Did I tell you they're gonna give us a brand new Kenworth?
Waynette!
In pace requiescat.
Chicago, the passengers are beginning to panic. When do we start down?
Oh.
Look, now, Charlie, give me a big laugh here.
Yeah, I know; but you're adding fake laughs.
Do you realize how immoral this all is?
Max, I've got a hit series.
What kinda business?
Ask Monsieur Rick.
Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
What is the meaning of that phone call?
You got it.
I don't know... Go up to her, make like you don't know her and send her into the other bedroom.
Guess who's here? Another surprise guest.
Debbie.
Who?
What's with her costume?
My Debbie?
They didn't offer you the job yet.
Right now?
Hmmm. I do believe Bravo is showing Spartacus on television tonight.
Really. You think you could arrange a little get together with him tonight on my behalf?
Not anymore. Football team started practice last week. He's already called me to hook up.
Too bad he's in Kansas this summer.
I shit you not. McConnell used to sneak in my dorm room drunk every month. We'd go at it for a while, then as soon as he'd cum, he starts freaking out. You know - "What are you doing, man? I'm not a fag. I'll kick your ass if you say anything." It's like, for Christsakes Greg, you're gay, deal with it. The only reason why I let him continue with his charade is because he's got a mouth like a Hoover.
Are you shitting me?
Let's just say Greg likes tackling tight ends on and off the field.
What do you mean?
I don't think that bothered him.
It would make sense. McConnell hates me. I fingered his girlfriend at the game last year.
I'm sorry, and legs. Legs, butt and hair. Well, isn't he? And shallow, as well?
Eve, I don't mean to be rude, and please excuse me Cliff, but Eve, isn't Cliff just a butt with hair?
Please excuse this interruption.
Do me a favor; take a picture of me with her.
I'm an idiot. I should have played the record first. This place is about to get burned down.
Well... I'm for it...
-- I don't deserve this. I'm still young, this is not my time --
Not this.
There's one to every rule.
Make an exception?
How about giving a guy a break?
Why?
They do, my brother.
How ya like that?
I'm not your brother!
Were you baptized?
Can you tell me how you spell...
Recite the Lord's Prayer.
Tell him we gotta go.
Oh no I didn't!
Yep. Have a good time at school, Ray. Wish me luck.
Jeanne, listen to me very carefully. We are all men of faith, and we shall earnestly strive for the salvation of both your soul and body as though it were our own. We do so in the name of our Holy Mother Church, who never closes her arms to those who would return to her. But we cannot help you unless you submit to our learned judgment and authority. Take heed of this charitable admonition, for if you persist in refusing our help, then we shall have no choice but to abandon you to the secular powers, and I think you know well enough the punishment that would await you. So now... will you please recite Our Lord's Prayer?
Hildy, if that's what you want, all right. We'll even go to -- how about Niagara Falls?
Sure I do. And I'll tell you something else -- I'd like a baby.
Sure, it was good -- it was wonderful! Only you expected it to be like other marriages. It can't be like other marriages -- we're different! We're a different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that for any honeymoon in the world. I bet you wouldn't, either.
I guess that's what I'm doing, then.
Relationships are a bitch, here. It's hard enough to concentrate ...under the pressure. Having a woman here is asking for it.
I can't!
What're you waiting for, Mayo? Get your scuzzy ass up here.
Business is business. Don't have To love 'em to work with 'em. Not If there's money in it.
Rawhide, go find out how Professor Hikita's coming with that formula. Mrs. Johnson, take Casper and Scooter, gas up the Jet Car.
Please?
No oxygen to the brain.
Close call. For the first time in a long time, it's really hitting me. Life's tenuous.
Why did you lie to me about your parents' deaths?
Yea, OK. I will be, I will be, I promise.
Okay. Why, all of a sudden, is the sketch dirty?
You-- Standards and Practices?
We're talking, Mrs. Robinson. We're talking.
Right.
Please...
Please.
We should take a vacation.
Hypotheticals --
But I don't gamble, Hilda!
Well, if it isn't the little Frenchman! How is the little Frenchman?
Yeah, it's a pretty cold trail.
You got to investigate. No question about it.
Jeez! That's a great story,
So is Buddy on your short list?
To pit your own life against another.
That's right.
Wouldn't be funny... Listen, I'll be back in a while.
They're not going to listen to me. You either. Are you kidding?
You said that once already... Too late now.
It's the greatest excitement in the world.
You're precious to me, Rose.
I have been known, on occasion, to howl at the moon. D'you understand that?
No.
Nuke...tell me something. Did you hit me with your right or your left?
My right.
Good. Good. That's terrific...
What?
If ya get in a fight with some asshole, never hit his with your pitching hand. ya might get injured. That's another lesson for ya--now quit fucking around and help me up.
Sorry about last night.
Forget it.
What's that?
My agent. I called my agent.
You're teasing still.
I know... I know... It's difficult for all of us. But sometimes we have to put our personal feelings aside and focus on the gQod of the country.
Objection!
The Sun Also Rises. For Whom the Bell Tolls. The Old Man and the--
Yes, it is.
You couldn't be. Look, Barry. There's going to be people from Laura's work there, people who own dogs and babies and Tina Turner albums. How are you going to cope with them?
We're not called Barrytown anymore, by the by. They got sick of the Barry Barrytown thing. We're called SDM. Sonic Death Monkey.
That's what we want. Reaction. And if Laura's bourgeois lawyer friends can't take it, then fuck 'em. Let 'em riot, we can handle it. We'll be ready.
You could help me find her. You know the people. I'll pay you a hundred dollars.
Then maybe Arlyn Page knew the Dumper too.
Did she and Jane McKenna know each other?
Only we call them agents.
Eh, no.
I don't know.
We? You mean you're --?
Bill, Rod, wait --
There were six on offer, you scumbag. Where are the other five?
I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
Yeah, OK. Forget it. We won't tell anyone.
Still working on being the first girl in the NBA?
Got me.
Why'd you let him get to you?
Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied
Because then I'd have to start taking out girls who like me.
You got me.
Against what?
Well, all those guys in the bleachers think
This play -- ?
It's funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it. "Richard dear, I'll go with you any place. We'll get on a train together and never stop."
Why did you have to come to Casablanca? There are other places.
Especially tonight.
Oh. I saved my first drink to have with you. Here.
No, Mr. Richard. I can't find her.
I believe this is a sword such as the archangels wield. Surely St. Michael had so fine a blade when he drove the serpent from heaven.
I'm going up to Berkeley today.
That what he says. Right?
Come on, let's call the Robinsons. We've got something to celebrate.
Ben says he and Elaine are getting married.
It does, it does if it's the version signed 'I still can't help loving you'. Read that.
Just knowing a person like that exists, knowing that for a minute that she felt that and wrote 'I still can't help loving you'. That's gotta be a good thing, right? That's gotta be a good thing.
Look at her, ya can see she ain't feelin' good -- needs a few minutes exercise --
Oh, yes.
In and out.
Make it three, boys--I'll play this hand pat.
H'ya, slugger, how they hangin'?
Speak with my lawyer.
Ahm, look this is a very odd situation. I'm a friend of Anna Scott's -- and she rang me at home the day before yesterday -- and left a message saying she's staying with you...
Why?
The floor clerk is out there in the corridor -- she sees everything ---
I could take care of her.
Need any help?
Have you got that skeleton key?
No --
Chloroform on a handkerchief from behind -- while you...
No -- no -- no -- no...
She gave you the old brusheroo, kiddo... Believe me -- this tart will never make it to your desert plate...
Yeah, Edwin, sure... and Pinnochio is a true story... Edwin! Wake up! This is a fairytale...
Merde.
Okay. So maybe you were right.
Right. Little twerp thinks he's Colombo.
Double merde.
Saint Severin...
Nothing... I was just running off at the mouth... as usual.
You remember Buddy, don't you, Richard?
Did you tell that to Marco when he did his what-does-it-all-mean thing with you?
I'm all right.
Yes, the Lord's been pretty good to us. I guess you're a church man, aren't you?
Oh Welch. That's what I get for praying.
I'm all right.
Where's my insurance policy? Oh, here . . .
Dell, I can't write unless I'm happy, and I can't be happy unless I'm here -- and with you. This is me, Delly. Pete Appleton. And I love you!
If they're only babies, then you pick 'em up.
Oh, my God! She's right! Why did I turn off Allison Portchnik? She was-she was beautiful. She was willing. She was real... intelligent. Is it the old Groucho Marx joke? That-that I-I just don't wanna belong to any club that would have someone like me for a member?
I-I-I-I would leave out the men's- room attendant.
Well, maybe we should just call the police. Dial nine-one-one, it's the lobster squad.
We haven't exactly been living the fairy- tale life the past few years. Something like this happens, it either brings a family closer or pushes them further apart. We'll just have to see how it plays out. I'm giving her some space, couple days...
Why don't you just do it out of the kindness of your heart?
Don't sweat it, okay. Sooner or later the truth'll come out.
That's ridiculous.
I'm totally and completely serious.
Good. Can you tell me how to get to Beverly Hills?
You sure you passed on my message?
It's summer! You're kids! Go play!
And when he came home. Did he write you about this? Or phone, perhaps.
Well, I don't.
Hello.
Well, hello.
Well, it was genuinely bizarre... she said, hi -- it's Anna -- and then she said, call me at the Ritz -- and then gave herself a completely different name.
So he could have decided to go on a trip...
I -- I can't Jeanne... I can't hear your confession... I'm sorry...
Well, stop hiding and stand up. I can't talk to you if I don't see you.
Here.
I just have a feeling. Where are you?
Why?
We didn't run out. We were coming right back.
I'm not going to hurt you. PLATO Why did you run out on me?
Sure I'm sure. Judy's waiting. You ready to come out now?
You sure?
Did you look for his passport, driving licence?
Jeanne... I believe in you... more than anyone...
You make it sound so simple...
Me?! It's not me, it's God who makes everything complicated! If he's all-powerful, why not let the English stay on their island in the first place? And why let this war go on for a hundred years? And why send you out to fight when a girl like you should be at home with your family? Why, why?!
I presume you checked your son s apartment...
But I hear so many voices... one voice saying one thing, another voice saying the opposite -- love your enemy, kill your enemy -- what is good, what is evil...?
The one I'm buying this week will cost around 150 million.
Okay. Maybe some of that is true --
As you wish...
You don't either. Take a look at yourself. Maybe you're scared that someone might actually like you --
I see that.
Maybe Carl picks up something about the freighter on his radio, which is now working. Same report Milholland heard. And that makes him get the lantern fast. Before the freighter's wake can bang it around.
On three? You call it.
Aaach...Jane... Let's take the part that has nothing to do with me. Let's let me be your most trusted friend, the one that gets to say awful things to you. You know?
I know.
Ok.
I'll see you there.
I won't.
They are washed.
Shooting?
Yeah. She says we gotta get used to being alone in this neighborhood. 'Bye, Dad.
Tommy! The guy's a sleaze-bag. She can't sing.
I don't think she can sing, either.
No, I'm not coming in. And if you'd rather go to a "singing lesson" than have dinner with your father...
We're not going to a singing lesson, she's just gonna start taking singing lessons.
So, what are you doing tonight?
Shooting.
Take care, pal.
Oh, thank God. It's going.
So, um --
What's botherin' you, anyway?
Yeah, well--
I didn't mean for you to leave them in the middle of the floor. Jesus. Look at me. What do I have this afternoon?
Bunny, you--uhm--you on that same medication?
Frank Sachs -- Melvin Udall.
Like thick molasses, with one of those wide noses perfect for smelling trouble and prison food...
Which color was that?
I got it. You're talking about your dog. I thought that was the name of the colored man I've been seeing in the hall.
My dog... you know... I mean my little dog with the adorable face... Don't you know what my dog looks like?
What's he look like?
Mr. Udall... excuse me. Hey there! Have you seen Verdell?
Franks shows my work, Mr. Udall. I think you know that.
How're you doing?
Hi.
Well, I don't...
No more revolts.
What were you fighting for?
What's that?
I'd love to get in there.
It must be fair old size, suppose it's empty?
It must be on the other side of this.
I don't know. This wall isn't like the rest though, it's not all that old either.
No way, it's sealed - if she's in there she's dead.
Aah, he's a bottlebaby, he talks to himself, the joke of the neighborhood.
You what, Mrs De Moraes? YOU WHAT?
Please, they'll be here any minute. Just put it in your bra.
You gotta hold this for me.
Fuck! I knew it! I fucking knew it! I should have my head examined, driving like this! Kandi, you gotta help me.
Everybody knew him. He got around.
They won't search you. I promise. You haven't done anything.
Just put it in your purse.
For the Princess?
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.
Oh. Well, goodnight.
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.
We were expecting you to return by six.
What did he want?
To know when he'll be king.
We took a nip of whiskey.
Yeah, yeah Here's half a buck, go have yourself a ball.
Sooner... or later... I'll have to stop.
Talcott doesn't usually show up at the office 'till after his 18 holes. What are they nervous about?
You paid me for a lot of reasons. Closure wasn t one of them.
Good. Then pour the wine.
That would be a girl. I don't even know.
She would never. Never. Even think of that.
Me?!
Excuse me, gentlemen, there's nothing natural about that .
What you do not smell is called iocane powder. It is odorless, tasteless, dissolves instantly in liquid, and is among the more deadlier poisons known to man.
Well, then, we must give the wrong kind of shows.
I guess it is. But I personally wouldn't care to be head of a business that kept losing money. That wouldn't be common sense. Incidentally, where is the 180,000 coming from?
Not the better half.
No, I don't think so.
I want to see you again.
This is funny.
Are you talking?
Cosmo. Many years ago, when they told me you were marrying my sister, I was happy. When I told Rose I was marrying Rita, she was happy.
Dead or alive, they'll stick me in there with Oswald. Another lunatic acting alone,
Yes... leaving immediately.
Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
I know about the bachelor party.
You don't know what you're talking about.
I got him his job on the paper. I'm a stock-holder, you know.
Yale '21, I believe.
We were classmates.
Fine newspaper the Tribune.
I knew your managing editor very well.
No. You just described every great success story. Alright, it's alright.
Well, you're gonna be seein' me shortly.
You comin' to L.A.? When?
Say, Baxter -- you gave me the wrong key.
No I didn't.
No key!
Baxter, I picked you for my team because I thought you were a bright young man. You realize what you're doing? Not to me -- but to yourself. Normally it takes years to work your way up to the twenty-seventh floor -- but it takes only thirty seconds to be out on the street again. You dig?
Especially not Miss Kubelik.
How's that again?
Now you're being bright?
Thank you, sir.
I dig.
So what's it going to be?
How's it going?
And it's less than pocket change for PG E.
Tomorrow.
And why do you say that?
Uh-huh.
Sounds like you've known a lot of lawyers.
Do you want to know what he did? Do you want to know what the crazy son of a bitch did? He handed the whole thing back to Kross! On a silver platter. For no reason! What was he thinking, I mean, what was going through his goddam head? Why? What was all that benevolent crap? What are we going to become, a philanthropic foundation? I'll probably be the director of several worthwhile charities.
I bet. A lousy whore and you're the gum in a hundred million dollar deal.
Do you remember one of your practical jokes that resulted in the smashing of a plate glass window?
Occupational hazard?
What's in here then, lead?
Partners!
A piano?
Would you be tempted to go for a slightly better bottom than your own?
Did you sleep well?
Well, anything coulda caused that.
The cobra's waitin' to strike, chica.
No shit?!?! You know him?
What'd you say?
That's right... Could have a bad accident, though... before... durin'... or after a hold-up...
What's that?
I see. You've heard nothing about the incident?
And charmed, of course.
I'd be honored.
Never even had a sword in my hand until yesterday.
Bitter? Because I'm not in Barrytown? You should be shot like a lame horse, you jerk. Just keep that out of my window.
None. Christ!
You're not even coming?
Of course I'm not coming. Do I look like I'd want to listen to some terrible experimental racket played in some hideous cave? Where is it? The fucking Bucktown Pub? Ha!
So much for friends, then. You're a bitter bastard, Rob, you know that?
Isn't it?
That was one of the reasons they asked me to join originally, yes. But --
Great! That's fucking great! They only asked you to sing because of your name! You can stick it above the browser racks over there.
How many tickets can I put you down for?
Good morning.
Thirteen hundred.
Sorry, you're not gonna see your mama again for a long time...
Something like that?
She gets off in an hour, so I think I'm just going to have a drink and then... make sure she gets home safe.
That's swell, Missus Fusari.
Lily--
It's certainly not good enough. But since I'm in a hurry, it'll have to do.
Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
Oh, thanks.
Go ahead, Ricky.
There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
Well, she isn't just any woman.
I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
All right. One -- two -- three -- four -- five. Five hundred. Be careful, honey.
I'll smile when it's funny.
I m sorry. It s just you don t look local...
What about you, Jim? Got anything to say for yourself?
Sorry.
Whoa! Whoa! I know you're a little upset but--
I guess I cut pretty loose in my day too.
He's just loaded, honey.
Come on, we're not about pickin' Fights. Just gonna keep a little Order, that's all.
What d'ya got?,
When they coming in?
What happened to the two Clays, Willie?
Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
I'll be sending you on a report tonight.
Mr. Udall, I'd like to talk to you please.
'Love was... '
Would you like to know what's in it? The report.
You could've been a contender, huh?
What do you want to do?
It's that hot rod Joey, right? That ' s who you want me to bend my rules for?
You're not going unless your sister goes. End of story.
Kissing? Is that what you think happens? Kissing isn't what keeps me up to my elbows in placenta all day.
I used to love this place. I used to take Kathy Reynolds down here.
Not officially. Her and Steve Kendall were pinned at birth. But I was crazy about her. And for about three months, I managed to catch her during her "exploring" stage.
Nobody did.
The usual...
We're all set, sir.
Only about a thousand times. What do I do now? "What's good enough for mom is good enough for me?"
The picture was fine! It's what that knuckle-headed dame wrote underneath! Of all the irresponsible... Amy, take this down: Dear Miss Archer. I call you 'Miss' because you seem to have 'missed' the boat completely on this one! How on earth would you know whether I'm an imbecile when you don't even have the guts to come in here and interview me man to man! No, change 'guts' to 'courage.' No, make it 'common decency.' These wild speculations about my intelligence --
Honey, there's a spider in your bathroom the size of a Buick.
Whatta-whatta yuh joining a minstrel show? Geez. Don't worry! I did it! I killed them both. What- what's the matter? Whatta you- whatta you sad about? You- What'd you want me to do? Capture 'em and rehabilitate 'em?
Oh, fuck, Lester, how should I know?
You know, I'm not a hugger and yet... I can't let go.
Oh, thank you.
Matt, I came here because in all honesty your son is just another piece of cattle to SMI. But to me --
You say in the report Glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.
Karen, I've been with the Bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.
Maybe it would if I took it.
Tomorrow I'll buy you a whole lot of detective stories.
There's nothing I can do to help her.
No, no, it's Hungarian. My daijka sang it to me.
It's a folk song.
That's too dark.
But, Madame Colet, that's a matter of eye shadow. I can straighten that out in two seconds.
Really?
Bye Ma.
I wanna live with them too.
Not at all
I don't know.
I don't think so.
Can you follow simple directions?
I was in the laundromat. I saw your car. Thought I'd say hi.
Good. So. Is it my job?
... and you knew about this.
He never mentioned that. Neither did y...
To him.
I don't know. It's one of the things I thought of.
You think I'd let you drive my Cadillac car? I ain't lettin' no hear-up-his-ass person drive my Cadillac car.
Okay?
Yeah, I think so.
Nice threads Dad.
Hi.
Uh...
I think, maybe, that isn't such a great idea...
I don't know. I'm just not.
What about?
I'm sorry to hear that.
Jefferies.
For what?
Who said I was getting rid of it?
I just saw a man walk out of your room.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on?
You've been following me?
Give me another double brandy.
And I adore you, Ninotchua.
No speech.
What can I do about it?
Are you scared?
What?
You look wonderful.
It's none of your business. She didn't have small eyes.
Oh, that's putting it mildly. We did everything but exchange gunshots.
Good. How are you?
It's a fine spot, ma'am.
You're doing fine.
She's not my secretary. She's what they call an executive liaison, and I'm not banging her, if that's what you re implying.
I can handle it.
I said "yes."
Bert, now listen to me. Ernie, will you take me over to my mother's house? Bert, listen! It's that fellow there he says he's an angel he's tried to hypnotize me.
When we know.
Uh ... we'll let you know.
That's the premise.
...I was the number one junior sales associate at E.F. Hutton in 1988. Did you know that?
What are you, crazy?
Seventy-five hundred.
No.
Okay, ten thousand plus a G.E. toaster oven, a Litton microwave, a Cuisinart...
Not interested.
Michelin tires... brand new. A set of Sears Best metric tools...
I'm marrying Debbie.
What is this person's story here?
Hi, Mom.
Hi, Alyssa.
I quit workin' for 'im, but just before I did, I ended up one night at a house... I don't know what it is they all think I saw that night, but I was just sittin' out in the car till the whole place went up in flames.
Well, there's a good side as well as a bad side to it... The good side is I knew your daddy, and I thought Clyde was a good ol' guy...
Yes I did... I sure did... The bad side of it is I did some drivin' for a man named Marcello Santos...
I won't tell you what came between... I'll prove it. It will take a long time, Ninotchka... at least a lifetime.
If you don't stay with me, I'll have to continue my fight. I'll travel wherever Russian commissions are. I'll turn them all into Buljanoffs, Iranoffs, and Kopalskis. The world will be crowded with Russian restaurants. I'll depopulate Russia. Once you saved your country by going back. This time you can save it by staying here.
They wouldn't let me in so I had to get you out.
Trying to keep me away from you! It couldn't be done. Naturally I couldn't go on forever punching passport officials in the nose -- but I found a way, didn't I? Darling, I had to see you. I wrote and wrote but all my letters came back.
What he's going to say next is -- there are people starving in the Sudan.
And this? And this?
What are you doing here?
How did you find out?
I phoned but nobody answered. I wanted to tell you how sorry I am -- and to find out if there was anything I could do.
Thank you.
It's in all the afternoon papers. I'm very sorry.
Yes it is -- I heard it this morning.
I rang the bell but I don't think it's working.
You can speak to me, Mrs. Haydn. I'm in charge of this operation now.
Okay...
Hello...
We can't let you do that.
I must get to my ship, Mr. Shermin.
All the roads into Death Valley are blocked. We'd like to talk to you.
I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to go home.
I think I'm floating.
Why you?
And you have no idea where he lives?
Here's a fresh one. Why you? Your colleague Mr. Wilson says Jerry won't speak to anyone else. That seems oddly possessive behavior to me.
Valerie?
So are you. You've got a vision.
Hey, can yuh watch the road? Watch the --
That'd be fun for yuh. Don't you think-
Fact is you're afraid of meeting a guy like me 'cause It might be real so you sabotage it with some bullshit about commitment to a young boy you can boss around-- Great deal. You get to write self- indulgent little poems all winter about how hard it is to find a man even though you just sent him packing- So what do you really want? You wanta be a tragic woman figure wallowing in the bullshit of magic? Or do you want a guy?
You'll total the whole car.
Yeah, watch the road!
I'm not sure, but it didn't involve getting blinded with poison.
We can show her the schoolyard.
Yeah, the neighborhood's gonna be great.
A batter has two tenths of a second to decide whether to swing--
You looking for me?
Oh, I was just going to...
I was gonna...
Well?
It's Miles. Listen, I don't know if you even care, but I had to call and tell you again how much I enjoyed our time together and how sorry I am things turned out the way they did. I think you're great, Maya -- always have. From the first time you waited on me. And while I'm at it, I guess you should know that my book is not getting published. I thought this one had a chance, but I was wrong. Again. Don't bother reading it -- you've got better things to do. So you see I'm not much of a writer. I'm not anything really. The only real talent I seem to have is for disappointing people and now you know that firsthand. We're leaving in the morning, and I want you to know that I take with me wonderful memories of you. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
Keep it elevated.
You told him. I'm fucking hurting here.
No, I did not. Must have been Gary at the Hitching Post. I think we mentioned it to him the first night.
Don't need a lecture. You fucking told Maya, didn't you?
Aren't you glad you didn't move up here and marry her?
Okay.
Let's talk some more first.
Here I am.
It happens, right...
Alright. Key?
Five hundred.
She was to meet me here--why don't you wait? She ought to be here any minute.
What just happened?
I'm missing something.
But -- who -- what --?
Wow
Finally, Roberts decided something. He said, "All right, Westley, I've never had a valet. You can try it for tonight. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." Three years he said that. "Good night, Westley. Good work. Sleep well. I'll most likely kill you in the morning." It was a fine time for me. I was learning to fence, to fight, anything anyone would teach me. And Roberts and I eventually became friends. And then it happened.
But she doted on the frowner
How much do you usually get paid?
Cronin's okay for lunch?
Really? Crazy?
I'm afraid so.
No.
Marcee -- this is one of our agents. This is Bob Sugar, who needs to learn to knock.
Pleasure.
Uh -- I don't know. Sometimes it's just like a barter thing... Is this legal?
How can I make your life better?
Yeah yeah I guess I do but there's a lot more to this whole thing than I thought, Charley.
Jesus, Ted, you've got to finish that damn novel so you can quit that stupid magazine.
Amen to that.
What? On your day off? Do you even know the guy?
Never met him.
Christ, Ted, I was only four towns away.
Maybe you're right. I should look on the bright side. I mean, I've still got my health... I'm out of here. I've got to get up at six a.m. to move my boss's brother into his apartment.
Thanks.
Do you know how ridiculous you sound? First of all, it's illegal for U.S. citizens to buy gold. And in the second place, the price of gold is regulated by the government.
That's your problems The more women think, the more trouble they get into.
All right. But this better be good.
I been hearing rumors about this new commander coming for a couple weeks now. Boys say they heard he's a real hard case. Spit-and-polish man. Full- bird colonel name of Payne, they say-- Bet you never figured you end up back here.
The Army hands you a command, you go wherever it is.
I assume a lot of your business is from our people.
So.
Well, you're the Man out there now, aren't you? It's your call.
That's right.
Your boys out there cooped up together, need somewhere they can let the steam out. If they're Black, there's not but one place in this town they feel welcome. Been that way since before you were born.
We have an enlisted man's club at the post.
No thanks.
Yeah. Okay.
Which one is Elijah again?
May 11th.
- there is the Harmattan, a red wind. Which Mariners called the sea of darkness. Red sand from this wind has flown as far as the south coast of England, producing showers so dense they were mistaken for blood. Almasy checks to see if Katharine is still awake.
No.
Yes. Absolutely.
All true. Herodotus, your friend, tells of a wind - the Simoon - so evil that a nation declared war on it and marched out to fight it in full battle dress, their swords raised.
Jack! The courtyard's been taken... The Baron's forces are besieged in the south tower. No sign of... Jack? Do you hear what I'm saying? We've won, lad.
Sunlight?
What?
No! Don't let go... you mustn't! I love you!
So, he's hiding in the dark...
But when did you leave? Are you here until then? Were you there until now? What direction are you going in? Are you a moving point on an infinite line extending into the past? Can anyone do it?
I forgot something--something at home. I'll see you later.
Thank you.
That's it, give it your best shot.
I mean, realistically, what are the odds that this is a terrific guy?
God, here we go.
Just introducing myself to the neighbors.
We could go together one day.
I mean it, give it your best shot, cause I'm tired of you holding that over my head.
Look, would you argue with your doctor?
I want you to find someone for me.
I need you to do me a favor.
This is George Fox...
The yellow one.
I will wave to you.
Mrs. Haydn...
I would--but our rehearsal starts right away. Before I go I want to ask you a little favor. Sally is an important part of my show. Some day--not now--when you get a chance--let her come to just one rehearsal. I'll appreciate it.
I'm not telling 'til you straighten up. You been acting like fucking Jerry Lewis on me and this shit's gotta stop or you can forget about your Betty... I mean it.
I thought chicks like you traveled in packs.
Thanks, Healy. Good work.
Ted? Don't you want the name of the housing project?
Do you think I consider this recreation?
Now, Lisa --
I want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. Does that make me sound like a madman?
It is like trying to a pick a lock with a wet herring.
It's just that... Mary. I wouldn't have thought...
Anyway, the good news is I have all the information you need. Got it from her bookie -- nice guy. You should definitely call her, Ted. I mean she's a real sparkplug, that one. She seems determined to get those rugrats off welfare and with your help I'll bet she does it.
Hey, what's happening? Mary! Telephone. What's the matter?
Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong. Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you.
I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail.
Oh no, Stifler, what did you do?
Kevin! You seen Shitbreak lately?
Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. So I guess...I'll see you later.
Just go!
Finch! Get to the bathroom! Now!
Me? Nothing. I'm the one whose ass he kicked. I'll tell you one thing, though. I don't think he's gonna have a problem shitting in school anymore.
You're gonna shit your pants!
And I appreciate that impulse.
I don't think it works if we're somebody else. You know what I mean? Gary and Celeste, Jesus, what do they know about anything?
...I said that before.
Uh...did you ever get around to e.e. cummings?
Did you ever get around to the poem on page a hundred and twelve?
Oh, right.
And be ready to make light of the offer if she's unresponsive. This has to be done very skillfully, very diplomatically.
Give it to me.
I think the only think you've left out are our relations with the Soviet Union. Sweetheart, everything's gonna be all right.
C'mere.
What's the matter?
About what?
Good...
If I whistle. Those boys'll see you, and come runnin'. You're the story today.
Naw, I've seen what that can do to a pack of cigarettes.
Thanks, but I'll pass. It's kind of a big night. I don't like to leave Jonah alone.
Please.
I can whack people. I'm hell at whacking.
I did some carpentry summers when I was going to school.
A real fireball.
Oh, how I looked for you, Elena! You'll never know. I wrote, telephoned, nothing. Nobody ever answered. But I dreamt of you for years! That's why I went away...and never came back here. Even as the years passed, in all the women I met, I was only looking for you. I had success it's true, but there was always something missing... I'd never have imagined that all this had to end because of the man who was like a father to me. A crazy lunatic!
And here, you just-
We'll talk about that later.
No! You mean right at the end? ALFREDO That's right, Toto, right at the end? And don't ask me what it means. If you figure it out, let me know...
Father Adelfio, I have a very serious doubt that is torturing my soul. And you've got to help me, because I've lost all peace of mind...
Stop it! I've had enough of your sermons! You act as if you created the world!
Heeey! Totooooo! Don't get pissed off with me now! Come here! I don't know where the fuck I have to go. And the next time be careful how you talk. Not to take credit away from the Lord, but if I had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. But unfortunately such was not the case.
I want to make you happy, Toto! I'm going to tell you a story. Once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. Basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! And he immediately fell in love with her. But what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...One day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. The princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'If you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end I'll be yours.' Christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! One day, two days, ten, twenty...Every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. Come rain, wind, snow, never budged! The birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! After ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. He didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. The princess kept watch...And on the ninety-ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!
Maybe he did.
Like you said, maybe he knows where my ranch is. If he does, he'll be waiting on the porch.
Who's Lednov?
Get him in here.
I m afraid I don t understand.
This is damn big of Bill, I also think it's smart.
You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill or The Raincoats, but they're right up there.
Why, don't you?
Confused kid? First he crosses me in public and gets away with it and then the next joker, and pretty soon I'm just another fellow down here.
Johnny, I can't do that. I can't do that, Johnny.
Then don't.
But my own kid bro
This is for you to figure out. You can have it your way or you can have it his way. But you can't have it both ways. Am I right, Sonny?
Gee, Charley, I'm sure glad you stopped by for me. I needed to talk to you. What's it they say about blood, it's
Thicker than water.
No, I guess not. I'm an actor.
Mattie, they're here! Folks this Is Celia Ann but you can call her Mattie. Or even Mrs. Earp if you Prefer.
Stop that!
This is a complete disaster. I wanted him to find a wife, but he's got the wrong one --
I'm glad you liked it. Good night, Jonah.
To get me killed...?
Always good advice.
Do I look crazy?
I'm sorry, did you just call me "Lotte"?
She'll drop you. When she's done with you, she'll drop you.
Get out. Out!
She means it.
It sounds exciting.
What do you hate most?
Well..everything's closed up. We thought we'd get some dinner. Say!....Anybody up for Chinese? Have you eaten? Would you like to come along?
It's always the little things.
Well, there's not much to tell.
Nice speech. I thought it was touching ... and funny.
Okay. And what do you love? Say everything.
Heroin -- peppermint-flavored heroin.
Well, I guess that's it -- dead end.
Go to bed. You've got to be at work in the morning. There's nothing more we can do tonight.
Yes, you told me.
No loyalty.
See what?
The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
They aren't as watchful as you.
Too busy looking after themselves.
She trusts you, John.
They don't see it.
Never thought I'd see the day a buddy of mine was dating a woman with three up and three down on her shoulder.
When you backed me you needed somebody named Deeds to bump the other fella out of office. Hey, folks--
Look, I'm not gonna campaign against your deal here, but if anybody asks me, I got to tell them the truth. We-- don't--need--a new jail.
Doing what?
We need a drug rehab program, we need a new elementary school--
It wouldn't happen to be your construction company gonna get the bid on building this thing, would it, H.L. And Jorge, you wouldn't be thinking about a couple dozen new jobs to dangle in front of the voters--
I say that feeling compelled to do the opposite of your parents is as enslaving as emulating them.
Elaine, just hear me out. I know things haven't been right for a long time. But it will be different...like it was in the beginning. Remember?
Nothing to apologize for, Casper. You've gone beyond the call of duty tonight. Mind if I get on the horn and radio the Cavaliers--? They'll be worried.
No sir.
Go out through the back.
You weren't in here tonight, were you?
Anything. Anything at all.
Oh my God.
Mrs. Robinson. If that's the best we can do let's just get the goddamn clothes off and --
Leave it on! Now we are going to do this thing. We are going to have a conversation. Think of another topic.
Art. That's a good subject. You start it off.
Tonight we're having a little party among ourselves. 8 o'clock in my suite?
Melanie...
Do you realize that the monetary value of this promotion and the prize is potentially worth more than the purchases?
Well, i-if-if you have some free time...
Oh. You must have been, uh, very unhappy.
I'll never understand it. You're so bright and charming and beautiful.
I think to myself what problems could she possibly have?
Yes?
Yes? LEE A couple of blocks from here. If you don't know about it, you should. You'd really love it.
It's a miracle!!!
I can't wear these clothes! This calls for dignity! I have to dress the part!
I'm sorry, it's just that... I was told to wake you up gently, so I figured...
The Supreme Being, the fifth element is here, in our parish!!! It's a miracle!!!
...What's your name?
That would take weeks.
To the patio and one north-facing window... And six inches to the height.
I have the permit.
I don't let him. He just loves to.
Never got to wear one of those.
Revenge? For what?
So what does he want?
What does he want? He wants revenge.
What about it, Mr. Deeds?
And how about this air? I'm telling you, a few days in this place'll put five years on your life.
I told you, he's got the gift. Same with music. Hears it once and he's got it.
What is hell?
I understand.
He was a good friend... The captain took the ship away fast and I was not in the ship.
I don't understand 'friend.'
The captain wanted to land to see close and to get some things from Earth to take home. The police came and shot at us. One of the people from my ship was killed.
Well, there's no use in sending it. See that--I saved you seven twenty!
Sunday.
Day. Wednesday.
Nice to see you.
That's not a spear. It's a pike.
Of course, The Slaughtered Lamb. Why else would they have a severed wolf's head on a spear as their symbol?
David, before we go in there I want you to know that - no matter what happens to us - it's your fault.
A severed wolf's head on a pike as their symbol.
Okay.
I assume full responsibility.
Hello.
Shall we?
November. '71.
Ho-lee shit.
Only you, darling... lanky brunettes with wicked jaws.
First night?
This time we take your boots off!
You see if you spent 3,000 dollars on pudding you could earn over one million frequent flyer miles.
That's what's used to redeem the mileage, so in noticing the pudding, each cup had an individual bar code -- in other words: Two dollars and fifty cents for ten cups of pudding is 500 miles. Add in the coupon: it's one thousand. You see?
You see?
....I'm sorry....I lost my thoughts, what I was saying....
-- the promotion says: buy any 10 Healthy Choice products and get 500 miles of airline travel or 1,000 for purchases made with a special coupon. So in the supermarket, you notice their products, first you notice they have a Teriyaki Chicken Dinner at 1.79 - that's a pretty good deal....but then I noticed they had soup at 89 cents a can.....and you start to do the math and you start to notice that it's a really amazing deal because I stumbled across the pudding at 25 cents a cup. Now the crucial thing is the bar codes on the label. That's those little bar codes, you know? The universal product codes?
What happened to him?
Definitely no comment.
Bon jour!
It's not your concern. It's... business, that's all.
What do you mean?
I don't know.
You think the D.A.'s gonna file on Joanne?
Thanks, Mister D.
You did a good job, Charlie.
I don't like to give up.
Take some time off.
What about Ray?
Well, would you like to know who it was you were marrying?
You know, I had a crazy dream last night. It was about you.
Sure was crazy. I dreamt I was your father.
He made me look the wrong way and I cut off my hand. He could make you look the wrong way and you could cut off your whole head!
Why are you marrying Johnny? He's a fool!
You're better than candy.
Paula, I never try to fool anybody about who I am, what I want... so if even in the back of your --
That's it?
I am that I am. You don't like my face? Maybe you prefer this one...
We dumped the whole load. Now quit showboating, Addison --
How is this, sir?
Yes.
Thank you. Now don't touch a thing. Leave everything as it is.
I wish you luck, sir.
Perfect! Perfect!
Anything happened? I've got to get dressed! I can't meet her like this!
Yes, sir. What is it, sir? Anything happened3
I haven't.
I am Joe.
Peanut butter.
That is not my intention.
That is my least vulnerable spot.
Just the same, you call the airport and let me hear you tell them. And remember, this gun's pointed right at your heart.
Call off your watch-dogs you said.
I do. We've got plenty of time to discuss that later.
That girl -- I --
Who is she?
You burn, you pine, you perish?
What?
Eve?!
I know...and I'm really sorry.
I'm really sorry!
Hey, I'll tell you what -- I'll play you jack-up pool -- just keep one hand in my pocket.
Hey, uh, mister? Hey, okay if I grab a cue?
Who's he?
If Kat's not going, you're not going.
Otherwise known as an orgy?
No, no. Johana is visiting me.
What kind of drugs?
You like playing games, don't you?
Did you call that radio station again?
No.
I just called for a second.
Long enough to call Victoria a ho.
It's a short word.
I was murdered, an unnatural death, and now I walk the earth in limbo until the werewolf's curse is lifted.
... You can lose it all; you can lose it all no matter who you are... I don't know, what's the point of having it all. Look at me. I don't have a goddam thing... the market's terrible right now, went down ten points last week, goddam Lyndon Johnson!
Listen to me! The young man in there...
But what!
Who are you to even think you can know the difference between good and evil? Are you God?
Thought you were hungry!
Louder, girl!
Yes, sir. That's the life, all right.
Put me down for Thursday again.
The mirror is broken. It was broken when I found it.
So it was. She threw it at me.
Sir?
You know how it is -- sooner or later they all give you a bad time.
I know how it is.
You see a girl a couple of times a week -- just for laughs -- and right away she thinks you're going to divorce your wife. I ask you -- is that fair?
No, sir. That's very unfair -- especially to your wife.
I just heard from him -- he's still hungry. That means killing Gideon didn't get it for him -- so he's narrowed it down to us. You've got it.
Why?
Where's that airlines bag?
I've looked, Adam -- you know I have --
What is it?
I think we were wrong about Tex having the money.
Open up.
I sure am. Get it.
Lord, you're stubborn.
Is very beautiful, your car.
Sailor ain't a murderer. You got to get off that kick. And far's I can tell, Sailor was entire clean prior to that involvin' Lula. Even there he was protectin' her. You oughta be thankin' him for that. That Bob Ray Lemon they say was comin' after the both of 'em. Why am I tellin' you this, you was around that night. You ought to know just exactly what happened. Sailor just got a little too forceful is all... You remember that night...
I don't... I... I can't remember...
Now, Marietta, I am goin' to help you. And don't be gettin' carried away. You don't want to be bringin' Santos and his people into it.
Sorry, sweetheart. Bein' in love with you like I am brings out that ugly jealous side.
Darlin', you ain't seein' Santos again, are ya?
And it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.
All right. All right. Now we'll go over every step you took since you left the house.
This way.
Now look, did you buy anything?
And did you put the envelope in your pocket?
Black Seminoles?
Yes. Especially toward the end.
No. I love you.
You... she said I didn't love her.
Can you sleep?
Good night.
You don't need a stretcher to take her with you. You know that, don't you?
Pleasure is for those who seize it! Do you think those insipid, pale- skinned mortals will ever know such rapture?
What?
The dolphins aren't the only ones who don't feel very good sometimes.
AND DID YOU?
I know, because I felt it myself --
Don't confuse one organ with another --
Go to hell!
You're no stranger to rape, Marquis; and yet with her, you cooed. You courted. You begged.
IT'S NOT YOUR PROVINCE TO ASK.
Was it impotence?
Who's to say I did not?
Where's the baby??
I thought you had her!
Lois, I don't have the vaguest idea -- as usual -- what you're --
Superman? Oh, was he here?
Nothing.
What?
Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
We'll do it next Monday.
Great. That's the fun of working in a record store. Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
What?
What?
That way.
What?
But before! Where did you live before!?!
Pancakes.
Cuz nothing happened at school.
Kelly wouldn't do that.
I'm no dummy.
Like you'd make it to June. Even cutting half your classes, you have a B- average.
Why Johnny Ringo, you look like Somebody just walked over your grave. Oh, I wasn't quite as sick as I Made out.
Oooh.
Are you okay? What's the matter? Are you all right? What-
What?
Kill it! For Go- What's wrong with you? Don't you have a can of Raid in the house?
Yeah.
I just figure things'll go smoother, you know, if we have it all worked out from the beginning.
She was talented, but honey I wish I could help you a little more, it's just that your mother and I had kind of a whirlwind courtship, she came to town with this traveling theater group, I proposed on our second date, two weeks later we were married and almost nine months later you were here and she was gone.
But if it doesn't work out, let me know. I'm,flexible.
He's got like six gold records.
Right.
You leaving that on?
Yeah.
Of course not. That's not the point. Goodbye! Goodbye!! I'll miss you!
I don't understand. I thought that you would be happy.
Well, because I never thought of God in my life. Now I'm giving it serious thought.
Uh-huh.
My gosh, those Commies are brilliant! You've got to hand it to 'em! "No, we didn't drop any bombs! Oh yes, our evil empire has collapsed! Poor, poor us!" I bet they've even asked the West for aid! Right?!
What? Did the politburo just one day say - "We give up?"
Yes. That's kind of how it was.
Uh, I think they have.
Hah!!! Those cagey rascals! Those sly dissemblers! Those, uh... They've finally pulled the wool over everybody's eyes!
Don't let 'im get you tight.
Whatta ya think that outfit cost?
Yes, well, everybody in Casablanca has problems. Yours may work out. You'll excuse me.
Go back to Bulgaria.
I take that as a great compliment to Sam. I suppose he means to you Paris of, well, happier days.
Good evening. You see, here we are again.
Good evening.
And as far away from Major Strasser as possible.
I was hired, you told me, to help bring Parrish Communications into the 21st Century. This merger is the vehicle --
Uh... he knows it.
Uh-huh. Well, Miss Moran, what is it you'd like to do for us?
It's one of Jack's favorites.
I was just wastin' time, peanut, till you come back.
Honey, I'm sorry. It wasn't nothin'. Come on and get up and we'll take off.
Good-bye, Maxine.
Told you not to call your mama.
Come on.
Get out of here!
I cannot get rid of you.
What?
Lord no -- charming -- but why one meal a day?
Yes -- yes indeed -- but you are a... ...a stenographer. Don't little stenographers earn little pennies?
Poor child -- I wish I were free tonight -- we could --
He was in desperate straits. He'd been trying to raise money all day. He laughed -- Poor devil! And then a man like Preysing kills him.
So did I. He was friendly to me as no man ever was.
You loved the Baron, didn't you?
What's the matter?
An accurate number would be difficult to gauge.
Tell me, Harold, how many of these, eh, suicides have you performed?
I have a sore throat.
You didn't--uhm--you didn't have one of your fires, did you? The stuff I left in the garage--some of it was my father's--
Bunny, is that stuff I left in the garage still there?
No. You?
Same weight I always was.
Best part of the job.
The pointers were great. I'll study the tape.
You were smokin' toward the end there.
Yes...I was thinking that way too... Which tie?
Yes.
I'm going home now. I apologize for what I said. I hope you can forget it. But I'm going home right now.
What?
Because I am confused about things. I can't tell what I'm imagining. I can't tell what's real. I can't --
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson. This is difficult for me.
I'm used to her. How's she doing?
Uh huh, well...good to know. Phil hands Nick a 5 note
I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
- that you're unloading for two hundred thousand dollars -
Unloading? That's a helluva way to describe the bargain of a lifetime.
Yeah, OK.
Leave the gorillas.
Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
I accept, but I insist on a wager. The loser must do whatever the winner pleases.
Do you see the gate at the end of the field? The first to touch it will be the winner.
I feel the ribbon.
You never sang before?
Exactly. Besides, no hard feelings. You found somebody. I found somebody. I thought we could double.
Shall I send a car?
Happy New Year, darling.
Is David acting strangely?
Could you get here without any trouble?
Right. Now listen carefully. I want you to bring David here. I want him in my care. I'll notify the police that we've found him. It is imperative that you bring him straight to the hospital. Do you understand?
You're certain he's lucid? You won't need any help?
What what are you doing here?
See you, Warren.
See you, Warren.
Good things...
It s wonderful...
She did ?
She wants me to arrange the financial settlement.
So, now, uh... you're not... I mean, do you do the--
Come on.
So, Mrs...
Thanks. May I sit down?
No, I have no idea - unless some of the silver-ware is missing.
How many months are you?
You don't.
Anne asked me to come and see you about the divorce.
Surely, sit down. If I had known you were coming, I would have thrown you up a waffle.
I don't eat waffles.
I was commenting on your hair.
I'm a pediatric cardiologist.
Mostly...little babies, but...not exclusively.
...It's all in the hands really. You know you have nice hands, you operate?
...so I guess I'll always...teach...you know...'cause it makes a good relief from the operating-room, I feel I have an obligation...
I like you. I don't know what it is exactly.
What'll you have?
It's got it all--sex, intrigue, immorality in the education system--
You exist here. I keep telling you.
Where are we?
Who knows, baby?
I was flying...my responsibility.
Not to me.
Okay.
Yeah.
Tomorrow?
Yes.
So, I enjoyed meeting you.
And that's the best part. "Teacher-Student Relations: How close is too close?" We're gonna blow the lid off it!
Of course it's the place.
Yes.
I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before.
No thanks, Swana.
Well, maybe I left the car up at Martini's. Well, come on, Gabriel.
It isn't me!
Oh, I don't know. Either I'm off my nut, or he is . . . . . . or you are!
I see. How much?
Tomorrow?
What about an untrained pup, white...
Yes... Good, good...
It must have taken him a long time to get them together.
Louis, whatever gave you the impression that I might be interested in helping Laszlo escape?
Because, my dear Ricky, I suspect that under that cynical shell you're at heart a sentimentalist.
It doesn't matter. There is no exit visa for him.
He'll take one.
I think not. I have seen the lady. And if he did not leave her in Marseilles, or in Oran, he certainly won't leave her in Casablanca.
No one saw me but the Italian and a dog. I blew up their generator. They thought it was an accident but by now they must have realised one of their party is missing. It might make them feel insecure enough to decide to pack up...
I m finished here and I m tired, Emily. You shouldn t be here. Now don t make it worse.
The piano on the beach? Ada's piano?
What for?
The piano.
Good, flatish land with reliable water, why? I don't have money. What are you about?
I'd like to make a swap.
If I was I'm sorry.
What do you say we send a bottle over?
Love you, too.
What hideous sin have you committed lately?
I know you ain't particularly pleased bein' here.
Did you say, "I do"?
Anything I can do for you?
I been calling for four months.
Well, that's how long I've been out at sea.
Yes, sir.
Listen, kid, I was sorry to hear about your mom. That's pretty rough. I would've returned your call a lot sooner but I was out at sea...
How was the flight? They take care of you okay? Long way from Norfolk, isn't it?
Yes, Sir.
I'm Byron. Nice to meet you. C'mon. Let's go get your luggage.
I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
I picked you for your verve, your excellence, and for your ability to - how shall I say - instruct. You've lived a first-rate life. And I find it eminently usable.
And -- there's no talking her out of it. Believe me, I've tried.
Oh, for the love of...
'Spooning'?
And I don't see any reason for any man getting nervous when somebody checks over the figures of his report.
Well, you goddam well should. You walk into my life, give me the worst news a guy can get, have me dancing on the heads of pins with my busi- ness and with my family, and now you're spooning with my daughter.
Are you insinuating that this is not an honest report?
They're going to draft me. In the Army. I'm going to be sent away.
No. That's okay.
Where are you going?
I can't even take a shower here.
And all this day an unaccustomed spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts. I dreampt my lady came and found me dead and breathed such life with kisses in my lips that I revived and was an emperor. Ah me, how sweet is love itself possessed when but love's shadow's are so rich in joy. News from Verona. How now, Balthasar?! Dost thou not bring me letters from the Priest? How doth my lady? Is my Father well? How doth my lady Juliet? For nothing can be ill if she be well.
I have never been so tired in my life. Okay, if I sit here?
Do I know you?
Got any easier questions?
I know how to say "Hello". Teach me how to say "Good-bye", that's all I need.
I was jaywalking.
By the way what happened to your leg?
Apipoussan?
He has a six months lease, and has used up a little over five and a half months of it. Quiet. Drinks, but not to drunkenness. Pays his bill promptly, with money earned as a consume jewelry salesman -- wholesale. Keeps to himself, and none of the neighbors got close to him, or his wife.
Put me down, Jack.
Oh, Maya. No.
Yeah, well, couldn't I take a look now?
You forget what I went through to give ya the best.
Listen buddy! Cut the crap! We're looking for Ann, not making a Goddamn movie!
Yeah.
Want to take it back?
What, all of a sudden, "Lucille Angstrom" isn't a name?
I haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.
Take the airport subway, but change at Jordan Station for Kowloon Tong.
Nothing is wrong. Everything is the way it has to be. In my left coat pocket is a packet. Passports, hotel reservations, tickets.
Which do you recommend?
It was sinking.
What was?
Our house. There was water coming in all the windows.
You're worried we're going to be all right. We're going to be all right. I remember sometimes you'd have nightmares as a baby. Your mom would hold you and rock you and sing you a song.
Yeah
Huh. I guess I just wish they made them like they used to. You know, something like The Heartbreak Kid... or Harold and Maude.
Can I ask you a question totally unrelated to your career?
Try to be. It's tough going with the crap they make today. If Dumb and Dumber's the best they've got to offer I say thanks but no thanks.
No. But the Boston Globe critic Jay Carr hated it.
You know, sometimes I wish I could be like Magda and not go home. I'd like to just bounce around for awhile, do a little traveling...
Ah, I'd sell that. Start fresh in a new place, quit the architect game, slow things down, read more books, see more movies...
Keep him out of Bedford Falls, anyway.
She's swell.
What do you know about dating a single mother?
Uh-huh.
Airight. Enough. I'm pulling him out of this. This isn't what I had in mind anyway.
Oooh, this smells terrible.
Desperate. To talk.
He's always in a bad mood. Count ya blessin's. Ya a healthy person -- ya legs work -- ya hands work --
Did he ever get rough with you?
I've lost interest.
Blood oath.
This is noble, sir. His wife is crippled. His children are on the brink of starvation.
Why Cancoon?
I used to live by one back in Dearborn. It's real frustratin' to be surrounded by airplanes when you ain't got shit. I hated where I was, but I couldn't do anythin' about it. I didn't have enough money. It was tough enough just tryin' to pay my rent every month, an' here I was livin' next to an airport. Whenever I went outside, I saw fuckin' planes take off drownin' out my show. All day long I'm seein', hearin' people doin' what I wanted to do most, but couldn't.
You wouldn t recall if the brothers-in-law left together, would you?
She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
No. Thank you. I ll be fine...
That's where we get rid of the traces of him although we never truly succeeded.
Oh - draw on my imagination, I suppose.
Never even been to New Madrid.
Been where?
Haven't I covered some territory? It feels like I've been on a Cook's Tour some place.
I'm an investigator. I'd like to ask you some questions about Tom Grunemann.
He's probably leaving some more of me around the place before he goes.
Who the hell is this "they?"
I... I don't believe this.
Peter, their hands are tied. You see that, don't you?
Leo, I was trying to impress a skirt. You know me, I'm non- political. Republican, Democrat, Communist, there's not a dime's worth of difference between 'em anyway.
So, you're saying that it's true. You went to a meeting of a known communist organization.
No. Yeah... I... I don't know. Maybe I did. Leo, this was before Pearl Harbor. I was in college. It was a bunch of kids, and I was just one of 'em. I didn't believe in what they were saying. Hell, I didn't even know what they were saying!
Congress, the FBI, Red Channels, it don't matter who the hell "they" is. "They" know who "they" are, that's all that matters. Now, did you go to any meetings?
I don't know who fingered me, but I'm not a communist!
You should watch what you say.
Of course.
Didn't think about it at the time. So no, it didn't strike me odd.
Good, good. Drinking some good wines and kicking back, you know. So what's happening? Still no word?
And?
Stella -- in economics, a kidney ailment has no relationship to the stock market. Absolutely none.
How?
Readers' Digest, April, 1939.
It's them.
I should maybe talk to you.
I love you and if you knew that... if I told you what happened... I'll explain everything, what we meant to each other. I'll tell you everything about our time together. You'll know everything again and...
We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned, a young nobleman of Verona
Which they did. Let me finish.
Why me, Mrs De Moraes? Why should such well-connected people as you hire a small- time French detective to look for their missing son, Mrs De Moraes?
Perhaps I should come back when you re...
I was hired by your parents, Mrs De Moraes.
Yeah, yeah, I know. I was just passing by. Thought I'd check in on him.
The name's Baker --
Black. Labrador.
Waterfront Crime Commission ? What's that?
They're back!
I think it's safe to get out now.
We've got to get Cathy.
Oh, he-he didn't say anything.
What about it?
I thought I recognized you. Saw you fight in St. Nick's a couple of years ago.
I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
I am a creature of darkness. I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
I know no more of shame than I do of fear. I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
I-I couldn't think where to invite you without taking risks.
You can't stay here. There's snakes and it's cold and you'll just get sicker.
I can't stay on this show. I gotta get some answers. Otherwise I'm telling you, I'm going to do something drastic.
I thought you weren't coming.
Lee... uh...
No, no-no-no, I'm sure.
Well, Comrade, have you heard from your friends Kopalski, Buljanoff, and Iranoff?
You mean you have finished the whole investigation?
That's marvelous.... You must have worked day and night.... Don't you ever sleep?
Well, Comrade, I am afraid you will have to turn over that work to someone else.
Please... sit down.
Cigarette?
Because you're having too much fun.
Some kids stomped a man on Twelfth Street, Judy.
Would you like to go home if we can arrange it? Did you notify the parents?
I owe you a big one, Hot Pants.
I don't know why I'm talking to you, you've got that thing on your head.
I don't know which ball's mine.
I want to duel him left-handed.
Is there another way to see it?
Yes you did.
Write me a note and ain't she sweet. I need a hand and where'd she go.
The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
Where is it! Please!
Guess that's why he hid it there. Let's go.
What's that got to do with it?
I saw him. Just before those bastards zapped him back. The ADM is in the wine cellar, in a bottle of Chateau Margaux.
So that's what love is?
Multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what I am talking about.
So how long to pop the floor?
Yes?
And it has nothing to do with the fact I left your room instead of staying there?
Oh, Kerry, this is Monica. Monica, Kerry.
You will forgive my curiosity, Mr. Blaine. The point is, an enemy of the Reich has come to Casablanca and we are checking up on anybody who can be of any help to us.
You think we can keep this thing going for a couple of months!
What were you going to do? Gold dig him for a meal?
No.
If you do, I'll break your neck.
Eat a carrot.
No, you rub it on you. I have some in the truck. Don't go away.
You want to go back in?
Come on, Peck, don't give me a hard time. You were in her ten all night. Did she say anything?
You've got it all right here, you know. It's just as beautiful as any other place I've seen. God, it knocks me out.
I also have a phone. I'm confident that in five minutes we can have you spick and span and back on the street again... in the non-prostitute sense obviously.
Chris, can you do me a favour?
Shut up! If you weren't drunk I'd
Don't write 'em? Why, that gold- grabbin' dame would double-cross her own mother for a handful of Chinese yen!
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell. They can't use the John Doe Clubs for politics. That's the main idea.
All right! Now, supposing a certain unmentionable worm, whose initials are D. B., was trying to use that to shove his way into the White House. So he could put the screws on, so he could turn out the lights in those lighthouses. What would you say about that? Huh?
Sure. I don't blame you. So am I.
They can't, huh? Who do you think writes 'em? My Aunt Emma? I know she writes them.
You're all wet. Miss Mitchell writes those speeches and nobody can make her write that kind of stuff.
Is that so? Then what's a big political boss like Hammett doing in town? And a labor leader like Bennett? And a lot of other big shots who are up at D. B.'s house right now? Wolves, John, wolves waiting to cut up the John Does! Wait till you get a gander at that speech you're gonna make tonight!
You're a brat, wasn't there anyone else around to lavish you with attention?
Bye.
This was a rifle range way back when. But we figured it isn't Army land anymore, it's your jurisdiction.
What do you want to drink?
Yes. But we figured it was just blackmail...
So, where'd you go today.
I'm sorry.
'Fish'?
I hated to wake you up. How about some breakfast?
You have a car?
From their tone of voice on the phone, I'd say they're taking us more seriously.
Nothing! There's nothing in it for me. Just the pleasure of your company.
You need therapy. Has anyone ever told you that?
So I have to have a motive to be with you?
Ok...because of the time difference if you needed to call me early?
I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere? I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I m sick of it.
Do you have any idea what my life is like?
Meet me in front. Five minutes.
Take it off.
No.
Are you wearing eye shadow?
Thanks for talking about me behind my back...useful in court.
If I walk out the door, who's gonna be here tonight for the follow through?
Do it now!
But..How could that happen?
Then what do you want to stay with me for?
Yeah so? The guy's beat up - he...he probably has a concussion or something, right? He'll snap out of it?
Parry?
I'd be very careful if I were you. You don' t want to fall into the clutches of some madman with plans to manipulate your brain.
Now, I'm no comedian, but it's pretty funny. It's a Little Johnny joke. Now in the joke, Little Johnny can't talk. And Little Johnny's teenage sister asks her mother if she can go out on a date.
And Fridays? What do you do then?
Helping travelers.
Like what?
What about Thursdays and Fridays?
She lives... isn't that worth singing about?
She lives like all the world before the Baron's curse lifted. Now the world's reborn, yet still she sleeps...
Where's your joy if you cannot sing?
On a day like none other the blessed earth has ever seen... A day so fair as forty springtimes --
I'm not denying it's a joyous day --
Not in the mood, I'm afraid.
Listen to him. Not in the mood...
Well, I had to get some dough to play with those suckers. Here, get this changed.
I hate turkey.
I told you goodbye. Why are you here?
This car will take me to Las Vegas. I cannot go back.
Also...stay out of the "Adult Bookstore."
I know.
Well don't get carried away -- I'm not that good at it.
You know, secretaries and stiff.
Yeah. Is that funny?
What do you think the Devil is going to look like if he's around? Nobody is going to be taken in if he has a long, red, pointy tail. No. I'm semi-serious here. He will look attractive and he will be nice and helpful and he will get a job where he influences a great God-fearing nation and he will never do an evil thing...he will just bit by little bit lower standards where they are important. Just coax along flash over substance... Just a tiny bit. And he will talk about all of us really being salesmen. And he'll get all the great women.
No. You know that I'm not.
Because we have the kind of relationship where if I were the Devil, you'd be the only one I told.
Yes, yes. I know. Right. And if it had gone well for me tonight, maybe I'd be keeping quiet about all this...I grant you everything but give me this...he does personify everything you've been fighting against...And I'm in love with you. How do you like that? -- I buried the lead.
I've got to not say that aloud; it takes too much out of me.
After work?
Mandrake Falls. M-A-N
I'd like to apologize for our local boy. He's been in love with Betty since the fifth grade, y'see. He means well, but he's in over his head on this.
Don't you want to hear the details?
I'm not interested in the details. And I'm not interested in the big picture either. What I am inter- ersted in is how my Board got conven- ed behind my back, is entertaining a further proposal from a man whom it offends me to do business with, moreover has the audacity to present this to me like a prize fish, and I am expected to clap for it like a performing seal. No, thank you.
That's it?
You've got to get me out of here! Six weeks -- sitting in a two-room apartment with nothing to do but look out the window at the neighbors!
I've been taking pictures so long I don't know how to read anymore.
Listen -- if you don't pull me out of this swamp of boredom -- I'll do something drastic.
I'll -- I'll get married. Then I'll never be able to go anywhere.
Really?
Look, you re making this into something it s not. This isn t a referendum on our lives, Kate. It s a step forward... Don t you see? I m talking about us finally having a life other people envy.
I sent these two looking for him, they come back shaking their heads.
Yeah, but we-we made so many plans.
If-if-if you can believe I have such feelings for you!
The recent past.
My days are not the old days, genius.
In the old days, every man had a shaving mug that he kept at the barber shop. Then, whenever he wanted a shave, held go down to the barber shop and there would be his mug, waiting for him.
Getting rid of my hub!
Uh huh.
Never, but I've been practicing.
Don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?
Yeah? Why're you here?
Oh, my gosh.
Get out.
Well, I'll do one thing for you that might cheer you up.
Don't piss on a gift, tough guy. You want to know why the dog prefers me... it's not affection. It's a trick.
Stupid dog. I don't get it.
Bond... James Bond.
Sure have...
Weight Station.
Yes, sir, I am.
I did. And his stomach is out of whack. So they need him for a couple of days.
I told him about your work, and he's very excited.
All right, it's a matter of death.
Don't try to stop me!
I have to see Bud Kruger.
No, dammit. It's a matter of life or death.
It's okay. I'm alright.
Gunshot... they'll file reports... they'll find me.
No, no doctor...
I had hoped you would come to me last night.
Yeah! Life's looking pretty damn good at the moment.
It wouldn't happen to be this...
What's the matter with her?
I just told the Father.
The Father. The Father.
Edie... Edie... ..
Sorry, that's the largest city.
Hello! It's Anchorage! Gotcha!
Juneau.
What's the capitol?
He has a computer?
Where's he gone?
In the house?
Maybe I won't have to. A bribe has worked before. In the meantime, everybody stays on salary.
How long can I afford to stay closed?
-- Don't tell me where you're going.
Now you finish locking up, will you, Carl?
Goodnight.
Uh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address.
Really? Care to make a wager on that?
Yummy.
Well, you don't have to get nasty about it.
You do?
What, nervous I'm going to win?
I'm sick of martinis. I'm sick of the waiting, and the carnival rides, and watching people's nightmares. And of course, I need not add -
Three months, Bull. Three months tonight. Three months since the accident - and I'm no closer to going home than I was then.
No.
No.
No, Judy, you don't understand.
Yes.
I just want to see you as much as I can!
That was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven.
Exactly. And I bet she's ugly. Real ugly. Otherwise, why wouldn't they print her picture next to her byline?
Yup.
Well, it's done now -- what's the use of grousing about it. Forget the letter, Amy, I just had to blow off some steam...
We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
Parry! Close your pants...
Holdin' my penis...
Holdin' my penis... What a lovely way of sayin' how Much ya like me...
Like an old hambone?
Yeah. I bet he would.
Good deal you were born down here, then.
If the next guy's a redneck.
You mixed drinks bad as you mix metaphors, you be out of a job.
You've got a thing about Ernie's, haven't you?
And they made the first move?
Mr. Jurgensen. Did he offer to buy the seven acres from you?
It's me you want, I'm responsible for all this.
This is your doing?
And you broke into that room?
Yes, they had nothing to do with it.
You will wish you hadn't.
That's right.
Found it?
Fuck it! Hold tight!
Solid little jobs, aren't they?
Why?
Great, with the occasional stabs of shame. Now, listen, this covers the weekend, but as we discussed, if you want to be intimate, we talk money before anything happens.
Some cream?
I can't.
You'll find the showers and things right back of the second cottage.
Here is now there. There is here.
Here
Listen, Brat I'm going to count to ten. If you're not out of bed by then I'm going to yank you out myself.
She's a little sad, is all.
She needs to be alone, I think.
Oh. Sorry.
...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
No thank you.
...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
I wish he'd do his job already so we could do our job.
We can't do our job unless he does his job.
Did you?
You could have called me --
I'm not settling for anything. I like cars, it's just not a move up the ladder to you, so you think it's a waste.
A call box? That s odd. Where exactly?
Yes. I m trying to reach a friend but I can t get through. The number is 01766 770 471.
They stole our land--
This is private property. The public footpath is back to the left of the bridge.
I can fix cars.
I think so. Although I believe that to be true of a number of Germans. Might I have a glass of water?
That'll be nice. A home with mother. A real honeymoon. In Albany, too. Ow!
Mighty nice little town, Albany. They've got the State Capitol there, you know.
Well, I'll tell you one thing, old man, she never looked at me the way she's looking at you.
I know I wasn't a good husband, Hildy, but you can always count on me.
I don't think she'll need you very much -- I aim to do most of the protecting myself.
I know you will, Bruce. Are you going to live with your mother?
Just for the first year.
Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country -- and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a home.
Well, I'll try to give her one.
Yeah, not really.
No. Not at all. It's nice.
You're so nice.
I sure would.
That'd be swell. You know, you're an awful lot different than I thought you'd be.
It wasn't Clay's fault. We've been moving around most all the time -- mebbe when we get the ranch and stay in one place I can learn my letters then --
I don't care if you love him! I'm telling you he's no good for you!
In this case, I can't. I - uh -- I just can't help you. I only would tell you -- that with Joe, you are on very, very dangerous ground.
What?!
I don't want to know.
Oh, I don't know. In my job as Deputy Assistant of New Business at the bank would have to listen to the problems of a great many individuals. This took a lot of understanding and sympathy, to try to work out solutions to their problems. But, you see, I'm not in that line of work anymore. Nowadays I'm a bank robber.
I think that about covers it. I think I have grasped the part about you being dumped though. That's got to hurt, I imagine. That's got to smart a bit. I mean strictly in my observer's capacity it seemed you two were getting on Pretty Fucking Famously.
Unless. Unless this is part of the routine. You get tied up, stick around, distract me, they both bust in and Steal My Cup Of Coffee.
I don't know what pet name Thorwald had for his wife. And that night he went out half a dozen times with the metal suitcase. He wasn't taking his possessions, because they're up in his apartment now!
You shouldn't watch, Jerry. It's a moment without hope.
Liza!
Not too bad. This brings back that Dumper in the picture.
I admit nothing.
Hi, Lloyd. This is my eighth and final call...
Would you like me to turn the lights out? Or would you like them on?
Yeah.
Which way are you going?
I'm your man... You win again. Well played, sir. You are on fire.
Looks like a lot of cactus to me.
It was once worn by Louis the Sixteenth. They call it Le Coeur de la Mer, the --
You haven't changed a bit. I'll put it in my wallet.
It looks like you. Thanks.
You've never cried before. I never thought you would. I thought, despite anything, you could always be happy.
Yes. Yes, I do.
It's the first door on your left.
Totally.
Sirrah! Sirrah, I am as good a gentleman as any in Ireland!
Don't worry, Willow. She's in good hands. You haven't made a mistake.
INADEQUATE!
Wait a minute.
Why?
Well -- it's very comfortable -- just to drift here.
Ssh, it's me. I'm calling from the deathbed of my mother.
The waitresses were very nice. My mother is slipping away.
Here's the guys I was tellin' ya about -- This is Cuff an' Link.
Not yet. I'm waiting till a moment when she's peaceful.
D'you really wanna call?
Here's your twenty-five hundred, Mr. Brett.
That's Carlotta Valdes.
There are things you didn't tell me.
That's pretty cold, ain't it, lady?
Carlotta Valdes was what: your wife's grandmother?
Well, I'm off to a pretty good start.
Want to take a walk?
Honey I know it's fun to think about these things but....
She can spread her wings, right here in Pennsylvania. You don't send a child alone to Los Angeles, she could come back with her ears pierced, her legs shaved and God knows what else.
Disaster, disaster lurks behind every palm tree.
Of course.
You've nothing to apologize for.
And she likes Pinot.
Perfect.
Jack, she's a fucking waitress in Buellton. How would that ever work?
Why do you always focus on the negative? Didn't you see how friendly she was to you?
She works for tips!
You're blind, dude. Blind.
That's on us.
You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
Lose?--I won a little--
What do you know about them?
Seeing you again....
Hahahahaaa... Nononono... Not yet... Hahahaha...
Have I died?
Your grammy!
Well... thank you again.
Jesus, my-my grammy... n-never gave gifts, you know. She-she was too busy getting raped by Cossacks.
I'll see yuh.
Shhhh... It's all right... Also, I either take you or that pretty daughter of yours to bed.
I'm gonna take your silence as a "yes"...
One day he's gonna find out what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer, and he could cause us a lot of trouble.
You're not tellin' me that you're sweet on him?
Well. That about does it.
No, not whatever. You fucking derelict.
Whatever. Sorry.
You broke some.
You need a new car anyway.
Oh, no. Oh, Christ. No, you don't.
She's . . .
Where is she?
Is it going well?
I'll be damned if you are!
But nothing is happening.
Very well.
Gentlemen! Thank you! You are welcome.
Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou. There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt...
That's why I came to see you, sir. It's that clock-maker's turn again.
He squeezed money out of you?
What are you talking about? She's a nice girl.
I don't know. I don't think so.
What didn't you like about her?
You don't like her. You only met her for two minutes.
You've been off in daisyland, honey. Everybody's got a racket.
You had to deal with him in running the club.
Well, let's not get inna fight about it, Ma.
Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
I'm getting her out of there!
Edie, down here it's every man for himself. It's keepin' alive! It's standin' in with the right people so you can keep a little loose change jinglin' in your pocket.
If you don't Keep your neck in and your nose clean and You'll never have no trouble down here.
Mmm, yeah, I guess...
No--
You think he killed anybody in Korea?
Why keep harpin' on it? Come on, drink up. You got to get a little fun out of life. What's the matter with you? I'll play you some music.
Don't touch me, God damn it! Just Don't touch me! Come on...
Doc...
Did Miss Lawson ever accompany Mr. Marsh inside during his examinations?
Then you have no way of knowing what Mr. Marsh told Miss Lawson were the reasons for his visits?
Dr. Trammel, did you ever speak to Miss Lawson about Mr. Marsh's condition?
Did Mr. Marsh ever tell you that he had spoken to Miss Lawson about his illness?
Let me clarify things for you, Jeanne. On the one hand there is the Church Triumphant, that is to say God, his saints, and the souls that are saved. And then there is the Church Militant, that is to say our Holy Father the Pope, the cardinals, the prelates of the Church, the clergy, and all good Catholic Christians. Moreover this Church, when assembled, is guided by the Holy Spirit and therefore cannot be in error. That is why we ask you to submit to the Church Militant... that is to say, us.
Alright, alright, alright, calm down, alright, calm down. Nothing's different.
Now, that's a nice thing to say.
Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
I notice you still remember it.
Yes.
They've done a lot of re-building but society, at least as we knew it, has utterly collapsed. People throw up in the streets. Others point guns. There's something terribly wrong with the automobiles and...and I...I can't tell you the rest. I just can't.
We stay down here.
Yes.
There's nothing I'm hiding. It's just that --
No wonder he's having so much trouble with it.
Whacking?
Five G's or I crab the works.
You're a pretty shrewd baby. We better get away from this gang. Talk this thing over privately.
Lucky thing, my running into you. Just the man I need.
You're not making any mistake, believe you me.
Say listen, when you're talkin' to old man Shapeley, you're talking to
Pretty incredible, isn t it?
He's movin' to your left -- don't let him no more -- dance and stick, hear? Don't play -- I know what ya feelin', but don't play.
He got lucky.
An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
We came back to the house!
Word's out on you, Eddie. You walk in the wrong kind of place and they'll eat you alive.
Now, when did you adopt me?
I don't know when it was.
Hi.
How much you playin' for?
Yeah, I'll play you a couple. Just for kicks.
I'm just saying --
I'm so dumb! I deserve to die -
A what?
And-and maybe, um...maybe we could discuss it sometime.
Oh, no.
No, I do. I want to tell you.
Goodbye.
Father, I was in the Army for awhile and every time they told us we were on a mission to save the world the only thing that changed was I lost a lot of friends. So thanks for the offer.. but no thanks.
Of course.
Good luck..
We have to save the world.
I'm sorry..
What are you doing?
I drive around.
Bourbon, little water, thank you.
Beer, please.
...you can have the best damn running backs in the world, somebody's still gotta block for 'em.
Wesley... Your wife's a very lovely woman. Have I seen her before?
There are a few things we want to check up on.
Did you see anything in Miss Wolfe's hand?
You see -- it means 'yes.'
That's very flattering.
Tell me, Baxter -- just what is it that makes you so popular?
Do you ever masturbate?
Mr. Dobisch said that?
And Mr. Kirkeby tells me that several nights a week you work late at the office -- without overtime.
Well, you know how it is -- things pile up.
Mr. Vanderhof, in Public Relations, and Mr. Eichelberger, in Mortgage and Loan -- they'd both like to have you transferred to their departments.
Yes, sir.
I was sort of wondering what you looked like. Sit down.
Yes, Mr. Sheldrake.
Been hearing some very nice things about you -- here's a report from Mr. Dobisch -- loyal, cooperative, resourceful --
Anybody can have a bad day!
Great. This is great. The whole town knows. Just out of curiosity, how do you two know?
Grace the dispatcher. Great.
It's very interesting.
Still, I think you'd upset people and I'm not sure that's right.
Thank you, but I really have to go.
Thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Worley.
Oh, now, don't rub it in.
Oh, I'm afraid I couldn't get away, Sam.
It depends on how big a news day it is.
How long has it been since you've been home.
We came from Washington.
Just a few questions?
Where's where I asked him about being scared? You should work on your speech.
I missed you.
Mrs. Robinson -- I don't quite know how to put this --
-- before he does -- You're disappointing them, Ben. You're disappointing them.
This boy -- I'm sorry -- this young man -- is soon to continue his education as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar -- but before he does --
I'll give you ten seconds. He is going to give us a practical demonstration of what I feel safe in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present -- and it better work or I'm out over two hundred bucks -- so let's hear it for --
Thanks.
I'm with a girl, Ralph.
Yo! Yo! Here's my boy! Here's my boy! Who's your daddy, boy? Who is yo' daddy?
Hiya.
And I haven't been with anyone since my divorce. This has been a big deal for me, Maya -- hanging out with you, and last night. I really like you, Maya. And I'm not Jack. I'm just his... his freshman roommate from San Diego State.
Will you let him tell it!
Sure--there was a bad accident there. They showed the pictures on T.V.
I was in it.
Go ahead.
I'm in terrible trouble.--You know that big high bluff near Miller- town Junction?
Mom--I'm not--
It doesn't matter how. I was driving a stolen car--
Anybody that's taken the trouble to get it would be a mug to put it back.
It didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay.
Could I see you a minute?
Doesn't mean shit. When Christine was a hostess at Sushi Roku, she wore a big engagement ring to keep guys from hitting on her. Think it worked? Fuck no. How do you think I met her?
And very nice. And very married. Check out the rock.
So what's a professor's wife doing waitressing? Obviously that's over.
This gal's married to I think a Philosophy professor at UC Santa Barbara.
You know that chick?
Sure I know Maya.
She is very hot.
Jack, this is where I eat when I come up here. It's practically my office. And sometimes I have a drink with the employees. Maya's great. She's worked here about a year, maybe a year and a half.
You don't know anything about this woman. Calm down. Let's just eat, okay? The duck is excellent and pairs nicely with the Highliner Pinot.
So what's the plan today?
Fine, thank you.
Hello, my name is Barry Egan and I called your service --
How can you possibly oversleep?
What are you depressed about?
Key word here is "indulgent."
He's screaming his opinions in my ear.
You know what a hostile gesture that is to me?
And this is the thanks I get. I did you a favor. You never wanted to marry that joker in the first place.
"What shall I ready?" asked Fanchon. "My mouth, my ass or my succulent oyster?"
No!
No... but what choice have we?
Your moans seem almost pleasurable, my dear... developing a taste for the lash?
Let that be our problem, just get us there.
I dream'd a dream to-night.
Can we trust him?
Why should I kill you? A simple course in etiquette... something your parents sadly overlooked.
"Homer Wells, born Portland, Maine, March 2, 1915..."
One has to be more than "careful" of Mrs. Goodhall--she has sufficient Christian zeal to start her own country! I'd like to give her a little ether.
I calculate that's the end of This town. And let's don't bother About the luggage, darling.
He is a goddamn psychiatrist--of course he wants to "help"! He'd be happy if he could help commit me!
We didn't even really have it. I happen to know for a fact that the only Stevie Wonder single we have is "Don't Drive Drunk." I was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.
Not the point.
Oh, so what's the point then?
I don't want you talking to our customers like that again.
Even then I didn't believe you entirely. I thought how could you be talking to me if you couldn't talk to people?
Rob. Top five musical crimes perpetrated by Stevie Wonder in the '80's and '90's. Subquestion -- is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter- day sins? "Is it better to burn out than to fade away?"
You just drove a fucking customer away, Barry.
"Our customers?" You think that Mr. L.L. Bean out there is going to be a regular?
Barry, I'm fucking broke! I know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.
"...graduated Bowdoin College, 1935, and Harvard School of Medicine, 1939."
... Ernie.
Ah... yes, enormously.
OFF WITH YOUR CLOTHES!
Coulmier, you animal!
What in God's name am I to do with you? The more I forbid, the more you're provoked!
What on earth would that require?
A night spent with the partner of my choice.
I DO NOT MEAN TO FLIRT, MARQUIS!
Oh, but you must, my pumpkin! Sex without flirtation is merely rape!
Nuisance value. Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Maybe they have! Mr. and Mrs. Semple, please. How do you do?
Just since yesterday.
Oh, boy! A jacket!
Your mom made that all by herself.
No kidding!
Thank you, Mom! Thanks, Dad!
Blow out the candles!
Yes. I found that a very expensive hobby, too. But then I never was much of a businessman.
Are you enough of a businessman to appreciate an offer of a hundred thousand francs?
I appreciate it, but I don't accept it.
I'll raise it to two hundred thousand.
I'm not interested in politics. The problems of the world are not in my department. I'm a saloon keeper.
My friends in the underground tell me that you have quite a record. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the fascists in Spain.
What of it?
Isn't it strange that you always happened to be fighting on the side of the underdog?
My friend, you could make it a million francs, or three, my answer would still be the same.
There must be some reason why you won't let me have them.
Well, anyway, don't get crazy. I'll do something for Zenovich's wife.
Tell you what... why don't you and that blonde what's-her-name come over for dinner Sunday. How 'bout that.
Well, it looks like we'll be getting our new school.
How come you all ain't sendin' them to the same school?
That'll make the folks very happy.
I know.
It's a changing time. Sit down, son.
Thank you.
It's hard to know how to talk to the white folks these days.
Guess it's never been easy.
No, I do. I feel like Clarence Thomas. I'm like... harrassing you... right now.
Breathe deep -- Keep ya chin down!! Use the legs and drive through 'im. Attack -- Attack -- Attack!
See how fast he is -- damn!
Come here. Come on, now.
Oh, I don't know.
More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
Don't you want to know where I'm going?
Look, I'm sorry to bother you but I was wondering if you could help me out.
Oh, yeah? It's all right with me. Go on out in the storm, but I'm going to follow you, see? Yeah. And if you get tough I'll just have to turn you over to your old man right now. Savvy? Now that's my whole plot in a nutshell. A simple story for simple people. Now if you behave yourself, I'll see that you get to King Westley; if not, I'll just have to spill the beans to papa. Now which of these beds do you prefer? This one? All right.
Oh, this? I like privacy when I retire. I'm very delicate in that respect. Prying eyes annoy me. Behold the walls of Jericho! Maybe not as thick as the ones that Joshua blew down with his trumpet, but a lot safer. You see, I have no trumpet. Now just to show you my heart's in the right place, I'll give you my best pair of pajamas.
Do you mind joining the Israelites?
All right, don't join the Israelites. Perhaps you're interested in how a man undresses. Funny thing about that. Quite a study in psychology. No two men do it alike.
...and his church group have volunteered to help us bring the supplies down. But we've got to hurry.
Wyatt! Just in time. Pull up a chair.
Is there some kind of trick answer?
I know. And nobody can make him.
Look, either shut up, or go home.
What are you going to do, Doc?
Get that stuff out of her stomach -- if it isn't too late. You better put some coffee on -- and pray.
I don't know -- I mean -- I wasn't here -- you see -- we had some words earlier -- nothing serious, really -- what you might call a lovers' quarrel --
So you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.
Want to tell me what happened?
Good, we're all here? A toast, to the International Sand club - may it soon resurface.
Something like that.
You know, Baxter, you're a real cutie-pie -- yes, you are.
And the people here don't want us. Are you kidding? The Egyptians are desperate to get rid of the Colonials - isn't that right? Their best people get down on hands and knees begging to be spared a knighthood. Isn't that right?
Zuzu Zuzu. My little gingersnap! How do you feel?
I know, I'm sorry.
He's alive . He still loves you. So do I.
Where do you think you're going?
You ain't goin' nowhere in the middle of the night, girl!
I'm not hungry.
He'll say that?
If I'm not taking you away from anything.
If you'll just listen to me for a minute --
You're not being funny.
What do you think?
I saw my lawyer this morning -- I wanted his advice -- about the best way to handle it --
Of course not. You had nothing to do with it.
Not yet. Every person in this office comes in here and watches you guys! It's like the goddamn Young and the Restless! Rigfort's salivating over it.
Been hittin' it awful hard, Doc.
You know, when you dumped me for that wimp, I thought, Cole, she'll be back. God wants the two of you to be together, and sure enough...
told him --if I'm wrong about this girl, you can take away my teaching certificate!
Of course I do. Josie, you owe it to yourself--to your writing, to go to college. You're a great writer. You just have to find your story.
That's your story!
You're better when you take them.
Okay.
I am. Please come with me. I don't want to do this here.
I can recover. Hold on!
I've got it -- hold on!
Let's go home.
You know what I'd like to see? Meat in a cone. You could put corned beef hash in a cone, or chopped liver.
Bullshit, a twenty-two doesn't carry a one-iron -- don't sandbag me, lady.
That's more like it. Two more nitrate-sicles please.
I say they should put more meats on a stick, you know? They got a lot of sweets on sticks -- popsicles, fudgesicles, lollipops -- but hardly any meat.
. . . two of them as they were about to crash into a transport full of soldiers.
Oh. What is your name?
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.
She saw through me.
What?
Where were you?
You're absolutely right. I should never have stopped to save that drowning infant. I'm just weak, Sister; I'm so weak.
Thanks, I'd like that. Thank you.
Really?
I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters.
I know, Sister, but I have a very good excuse.
Say, you could do anything with me you wanted to. Putty - just putty, that's me. Now getting back to those eyes of yours - would you mind if I kind of got closer so I could see them?
Well, until you know, you can't go.
Go on with your dream. What was it that frightened you?
The news is not good, kid. This bit here... see there... it's broken. You need a new one.
How'd this happen?
I don't know. I'll find out though.
Tell me about Frank Ligourin.
What about the old gentleman the other night, Mr. Faber?
OK.
-- OK --
Come on, sweetheart...
You don't know what it is to be sorry.
See? It stopped.
Look--just relax, will you?
He's home. I heard the car.
What's that pounding?
You can trust me, Judy.
Reggie -- open the door.
The shower's in there.
Did you ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
Got you.
That's your problem.
The world isn't going to end, you dummy; I hope you know that much. But it is going to change. It's going to change drastically, and probably in your lifetime. The Clock People see calamitous earthquakes as the agent of change, and they may be right, since there are a hundred thousand earthquakes a year and major ones are long overdue. But there are far worse catastrophes coming... unless the human race can bring itself to abandon the goals and values of civilization, in other words, unless it can break the consumption habit -- and we are so conditioned to consuming as a way of life that for most of us life would have no meaning without the yearnings and rewards of progressive consumption. It isn't merely that our bad habits will cause global catastrophes, but that our operative political-economic philosophies have us in such a blind crab grip that they prevent us from preparing for the natural disasters that are not our fault. So the apocalyptic shit is going to hit the fan, all right, but there'll be some of us it'll miss. Little pockets of humanity. Like the Clock People. Like you two honeys, if you decide to accept my offer of a lease on Siwash Cave. There's almost no worldwide calamity -- famine, nuclear accident, plague, weather warfare or reduction of the ozone shield -- that you couldn't survive in that cave.
Yes?
That was Marvin Untermeyer.
What?
My God.
I'm sorry to hear that. But you weren't close, were you?
Rex just had a massive coronary. In the middle of a business meeting. He's dead.
What do you mean, was.
He was Rex Rexroth's personal attorney.
You are a catch. No doubt she's worried that she would lower the standard of your offspring. Everybody wants to "breed up". What's wrong with her?
You know how it is with these altered births --somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.
Yes.
Marvin says that Rex's will is four years old. He never redrafted it.
She doesn't have to know. She doesn't want to know.
The skin flake was found in Michael's Restaurant. The employees are all accounted for.
You're not thinking of telling her, are you?
Of course not. But she's have to know eventually.
It's fine.
Why would they do that. They hired me.
I don't think so
You're right. So why take a chance--
Forget it.
Here you are, sir.
Damn right.
I couldn't say anything. I just stood there, hating her.
Your lines are in the script, but you can ad lib.
In fact, I want you to ad lib, that's the magic I'm after. I wanna give a whole new feel to the show.
I think so.
Fucking.
Did you hear it?
Fucking.
Fucking. She says fucking in front of an entire room of people.
Do you believe it's true, Sebastian?
I'm just being honest. I just wanted to see what you were like in bed.
You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
I believe you, and I see I must hasten to leave, for otherwise I shall become the unhappiest of men.
You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
Mm-hm.
...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's--
Really?!
Well...
Time is of no importance, Mr. President. Only life is important.
I'm sorry... I can't hear you. I can't turn my head all the way yet... tell her we can't hear her.
Do you want to know what happened with my parents?
Nonsense!
Why not?
Ohhh, I hate this.
I just want to make sure that you both --
Harvard? Whoa, Daddy!
Well -- at the moment, that'd be me.
-- we are both sure that's what we want?
Course I can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. Massey -- this is one bad bad little girl.
I m talking about the best schools in the country here, Kate...
A company called P.K. Lassiter and Associates Investment House uses it to attract new executives...
You re talking to their new Vice President of Mergers and Acquisitions.
I don t think so. This is going to be a better life for all of us, honey. We ll put Annie and Josh in private schools...
It's not a game. Something you play.
Harold, I think you're getting carried away here.
Sir, how about souvenirs?
Souvenirs?
Of your kill - ears, nose, scalp, privates.
Eh?
How about to slit his throat?
Well, I don't...
I'd like that. You could see the blood squirt out.
You gonna climb that with one arm?
Harold!
What's the chance of getting one of these?
They really have to work on that street name thing.
A parting gift from the Empire.
You know, Flip, Vietnam War was fought because of a bet Howard Hughes lost to Aristotle Onasis.
I gotta go, Flip. Thanks.
It's no good without the argon gas.
It's for my daughter.
Thank you.
Well, you do have the dress.
So am I.
Faith, this guy you think is Mr. Right, he's... not what you think--
What's the problem?
Hey, I'm new here, what do you want?
If you know about the church, why ask such stupid questions?
So, if you and the nutty professor are both werewolves, what do you want with drugs? You like seeing lots of pretty colors when you're tearing people's throats out?
Yeah, okay. Just gimme a minute to freshen up.
The ADM. Let's go.
One more time would be nice.
I love you.
Then why do you want to go?
Yeah.
Great... can we talk later?
What are you crying for?
I I never knew a girl like you, Edie. I always knew the kind you just grab 'em And I never knew a girl like you, Edie.
"I found a million dollar baby "
Yeah.
Well, there's a lot of Communistic sympathizers around --
I know it! But they've got nothing to do with this case! Do you realize there are two hundred thousand votes at stake and unless we hang Earl Williams we're going to lose 'em?
But we're going to hang him, Fred. He can't get away.
That gives you an idea of what I'm up against!
We're up against a lot more than that with that nutty slogan you invented: 'Reform the Reds With a Rope'.
Williams ain't a Red, and you know it!
Yeah?
I'll bite. What's the catch?
...Congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. Reinvented the wheel. I'm going to recommend to the Board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass-produced with all deliberate speed. Of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.
I know where to find it. Taking possession be another matter.
Twill take more than heart. Where do we find the armor of Achilles, for a start?
Time for a champion. Can you do more than pick acorns and rob bird's nests, Jack?
If the horn be restored the curse is ended.
Bravely spoke. You've the heart of a champion, true enough.
I'll do what I have to do, for Princess Lili's sake!
A tomb it once was, boy, and a tomb it may yet be... There's another in residence at Lindfarne now.
I agree; but God put us on earth to take that risk.
That is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.
It is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.
Then you have never loved? Your heart is empty.
What! You have not met a man worthy of your attention?
Not... quite.
Why?
Are you his friend?
He must.
I'll survive.
YOU BETTER NOT BE RAGGING ME... IF YOU'RE FLYING UPSIDE DOWN...
YEAH, COUGAR?
I'M UPSIDE DOWN. I KNOW IT. I'M GONNA EJECT.
NO JOKE, COUGAR. ON THE LEVEL. EVEN I WOULDN'T DO THAT TO YOU.
I'd gladly write you a letter of recommendation.
TELL HIM, WILL YOU TELL HIM? OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE OKAY.
MAVERICK.
I've seen students with records like yours go to J.C. for a couple of years, then transfer to a good college.
You're welcome.
COUGAR, YOU'RE ON THE BALL.
Look at the weather! They'll never find us! We're near out of fuel. Put it down.
No, it's a very groovy girl.
Why you nitwit. You almost destroyed the most sensitive deal of my career!
Ahm let's see -- ahm. No. Gone completely. Oh no, wait. There was -- one from your mum: she said don't forget lunch and her leg's hurting again.
Donde vamos?
What about the "Roaring Twenties" or "The 80's"?
...Fine.
The owner was suppose to pick him up three weeks ago.
He only had a hundred an' thirty. -- I think he's good for the rest next week, Mr. Gazzo.
Sure, Rocky, Bob's good for it...
...What kinda dog is this again?
But I have to!
MUSTANG, THIS IS MAVERICK, REQUEST A FLYBY.
How do you guarantee that?
I'd go with the seven.
I see where you're going.
The exercise tape? Sure, I've seen it on T.V.
'That right? Good for you.
The plastic surgeon! I read about you in LA Style.
Do you have it?
You have the pre-nup?
If you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?
The body?
Have you any money?
Okay. All right, now, let's see. Where were we? Oh yes. In the Pit of Despair.
Nobody. Nobody kills him. He lives. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 90.
I don't understand.
You were plenty scared that night in the car.
-- Hello, Ilsa.
It's all right. It's all right, Anne. I can take a hint. A bit subtle, but I get it. It's all right.
Hey, what do you say we call off this little charade of yours over a couple of beers at Trader Jon's...? Come on, man. You're about as close to being officer material as me.
Yes - Sing Sing.
I'm leaving now. Gate 43.
You won't have to.
You keep coming after me and looking down on me. It's starting to make me batty.
Well, let's do a special report on that...I mean that's news.
What I don't know, I can learn and what I know, nobody can teach. Excuse me for saying it about myself, but I think it's true. What do you think? Never mind what you think.
Shouldn't we pay 'em for the damages?
Yeah.
Time marches on. Ardor cools.
But then... But then...
Now Rex.
That's her job. You have to respect that.
Mm.
When I first met Marylin -- Well, we were crazy about each other. Not emotionally, of course. We just couldn't keep our hands off each other.
I thought you two were in Austin, Texas. Or Takes-us, as they say in these parts.
Uh-oh...
... But as I began to investigate, I realized that this pattern of corruption extended much higher...
Jesus...
Now he's making stuff up about me.
Nothing.
I don't think this is the lightning you are looking for. Drew's a good man. I know I didn't seem to be completely in his corner before, but I've come to appreciate --
I won't say you may be getting onto shaken ground --
What is the nature of your interest in Joe?
Hi, doll, what's wrong?
Ok. Well. I'm gonna go out of town. I'm going to go out of town just for two days...
Where you goin?
I'm going to go to Hawaii but you can't tell my sisters that.
Wow, you're goin' to Hawaii, that's great -- you're goin -- ?
Yeah but you can't tell my sisters that.
Ok.
Alright: And I have to go and buy some more pudding for this trip to Hawaii and as I just said that out loud I'm realizing it sounds a little strange but it's not. So can you come and help me out?
Ok.
They need to be scanned individually. They each have a bar code, so I need it scanned individually so that each and every cup appears on the receipt...
I don't have a problem with that. It's up to Annie.
When I was a little kid, I used to want to go to Europe but right now wherever I am I'm gonna be in Europe.
No.
I am, I am. But I've had it with chicks. They're like an occupational hazard. Six guys working for me... I'm gonna retire or settle down or something.
I just came from a meeting... I can't talk about it now, baby. But in a few days -- see I'm disgusted with my life.
It wouldn't be like that. I want to get you off the street. You'll have a different kind of life. What's wrong with that?
That's ironic. Because we're here to protect her from you.
You're going.
Lioness Rushes to Defense of Cub.
Boy, did you see her go?
The iguana?
He's a lucky man. Do I know him?
He was just born, remember? This is the first one. You know that guy, Dr. Gene Scott? He said that the story of Spiderman is the story of Christ, just disguised. Well, I thought about that even before I heard him say it. Hold on, let me show you my favorite comic book cover of all time.
Well, we sell other things too. Cool stuff. "Man from U.N.C.L.E." Lunch boxes. "Green Hornet" board games. Shit like that. But comic books are main business. There's a lot of collectors around here.
That's a "Rookies" doll. George Sanford Brown. We gotta lotta dolls. They're real cool. Did you know they came out with dolls for all the actors in "The Black Hole"? I always found it funny somewhere there's a kid playin' with a little figure of Earnest Borgnine.
Sometimes I wonder if it's worth it. Busting my ass, for what?
Right. See? You're ready for the quiz.
Well, there's someone I think might be --
That's because it's such a nice one.
Oh, right. As long as you're happy. I'm sure he's a better lover than I ever was.
There are many would pay a king's ransom for a few drops of unicorn blood.
How bad was the unicorn's wound?
He did run?
Water pump's busted. I don't know if it's worth fixin', but I need that car.
I thought you took care of this. It always breaks in the same place. It's your splice, isn't it?
It's your splice! You blame me for everything!
So you re not at a non- profit firm?
To Paris. Paris, France.
You re moving...
Yes, I did.
You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. So, what are you doing here?
Livid is good. So what is it, Maggie? You here on business? I saw your lamps. They're terrific.
I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I? But I can't speak for Italics. Traitor!
It looks like the work of a brother...
If it's Cassius, yes.
...as a narcissist, he couldn't blame himself. He created the voices after the fact.
The Hejira was the flight of Mohammed from Mecca in 622.
That's a wonderful story, Snoop. I'm very excited about tonight.
She is.
Goodnight.
Aw, Johnny... .
I thought you were gonna keep an eye on that church meeting.
I'm tryin' to keep you from being hurt What more do you want?
It must have been once too often. I think your brains come apart. What you got up there, Chinese bells?
Racket? What do you mean?
We've been waiting to do a follow up episode on you for a long time. And that time has definitely come. I feel it's apparent to anyone who's hip to what's going on that the prison board has thrown the constitution straight out the fuckin' window. You and Mallory may be killers, but you're not insane. You belong in a prison, not in an asylum. The prison board is blatantly railroading you into a hospital for the sole purpose of turning you into vegetables. Now some people are saying, 'So what?' I am not one of those people. If we avert our eyes while they do this to you, we give them permission to do it again whenever they see fit. Today they wipe clean your mind because they feel your actions are dangerous, tomorrow they wipe clean my mind because they feel what I say is dangerous. Where does it all stop?
My problem Mickey, is that you don't exactly inspire empathy. I'm all alone on this. I need your help. I want what the prison board is doing to be the focus of our follow up episode. Now I have interviews with chairman of the prison board Dewight McClusky about this issue. And I'm tellin' ya, Mickey, he looks bad. The two psychologists they used for their psychiatric kangaroo court won't talk to us, which always looks bad. I have an interview with both the judge of your trial, Bert Steinsma, and the psychologist and author, Emil Reinghold, both of which discount the notion that you're insane. You put that all together, and what the state is doing becomes obvious. But the network isn't satisfied. They feel the show needs another element. It needs you. In order to put the show on the air, I need to get an interview with you. You haven't talked to the press since your trial. Now, a few days before you get transferred to an asylum, you grant an interview on television with Wayne Gayle. We're talkin' a media event here. Every son of a bitch out the with a TV set's gonna tune in to see that. We'll make their motives so blatant, we'll shame 'em into dropping the whole thing. At least for a little while, the publicity would keep them from just giving you and Mallory lobotomies. Well, whatta ya say?
Have you talked to Mallory about this?
She won't even see me, Mickey. Now you're not supposed to know anything about what's going on with her, but I'm gonna tell ya somethin'. Since you two've been sentenced, Mallory hasn't spoken one word.
What I'd like to do---
How 'bout Manson?
Manson beat you.
Yeah, it's pretty hard to beat the king.
Yep. There was a major league scout there watching me, too. And he came down after the game with a contract. Do you know what? I couldn't life my arm to sign it. But I'll be okay again as soon as I get it fixed up.
Oh, my God...
Well, Dionne Warwick, guess his home town.
Right on the button.
Oh, yes.
Really? Since when?
Maybe Eve can guess. She's psychic.
And it's called...?
Oh, yeah, I'm calm. In fact, I'm totally "relaxed..."
I was just going to!
I see.
Is that her real name?
By all means.
He did?
Sure. I can sing "Humoresque."
What do you think?
Take those handcuffs off our friends, Pete. That wasn't at all necessary.
Yeah, and I better call my sister.
...How's the turtle food this week?
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object.
Yeah? What's that?
We took all the chances. The money belongs to us, not him!
Excuse me...
What are we about to do?
I never say anything I have to.
I don't drink coffee...
I don't drink coffee...
You and all of the teachers in this dump--your story's over, so you don't want anybody else to have fun.
Just 'cause I'm not like Little Miss Honor Roll here--
So?
Woman bites chicken leg, turns out to be a mouse. Or a rat. It's an urban myth.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
The FBI can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.
Well, that's a relief. I understand they usually don't let that stop them.
However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
Don't let them hurt you.
And what?
It was a mistake, I never wanted to hurt you, but it had to end sooner or later and now, well now I love someone else.
There's nothing there for me.
Forget about me Kat.
I'm no good for you Katka, besides I won't be able to stay in Prague.
No Kat, I lied to you, I hate England and I don't ever want to live there again.
What's to think about?
Upset? Why should I be upset?
Forget about my sister. If Karen Sisco's tailing Glenn, we're fucked. Tomorrow night at the fights we all get picked up.
Let's drive by where we're meeting and have a look. Maybe take a look at Ripley's place while we're at it.
Forty-five minutes.
You didn't tell your sister about Ripley, did you? 'Cause I don't wanna go through that again.
Two hours.
You don t say.
One just doesn t... Tell me, what does one speak about, huh?
Why did you send me after Friedman? To atone for your sins?
I don t.
You're telling me to dance.
Rick, I want to talk to you.
It's true.
Just give me a moment and then you'll be free...
Yeah. Sure, sure.
But who was the Devil?
Very instructive
I'll be damned...
Her maiden name was Sullivan.
Better go with 'em, honey. Here's Where I leave you.
The five hundred? Sure.
All right, dear.
All right. The check will be certified. Want my fingerprints?
What do you think I am -- a crook?
But --
Wonderful ... But tomorrow morning, if you should wake out of your dreams and hear a knock, and the door opens, and there, instead of a maid with a breakfast tray, stands a policeman with a warrant--then you'll be glad you're alone.
No, no, no, no, no. What do you mean? It doesn't state anywhere about six to eight weeks.
You know you can get places in the world with pudding. That's funny.
That's funny.
Yeah.
What I've been doing?
I had this whole thing in my head, I was gonna be able to get this to you today -- I have to leave today --
Oh, I don't blame them, really. I guess I have sort of made a mess of things. These folks have to protect their investment. Most of them are very nice people --
Edie, I do what I can. I'm in the church when you need me.
Fair enough. What'll we talk about at dinner?
Okay to say something now?
The two might go together.
Cute.
How you doing?
That seems like a good choice.
And one of 'em is sick.
You know, on farm route 17.
The whole state's lookin' for 'em. And they're lookin' for me.
Maybe you won't feel that way after I tell you what I stopped in for.
They think I offed the Director.
But I'm going to have to leave 'em here. They're --- well they're not the sort of people you're used to.
Don't like yours neither.
...No.
We did not leave together.
If you only mean to dupe me again --
Maybe she had to use the bathroom. She pees, doesn't she?!...
This doesn't look like the kind of place Betty would go to.
You've a touch of the poet, too; perhaps you should take up the quill.
Do I have your word?
Well?
Naturally.
How'd he die?
He's why you punish yourself.
You run with your back to the picture. Like you were trying to get away. Once in awhile you sing along with music, but mostly you punish yourself.
Johnny Dancer, right? You don't ride him anymore, do you? Not since your dad died.
It's a little "Silence of the Lambs" for me. I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run.
Always a mood killer.
Well, I'm impressed. Absolutely incredible. I didn't expect pink and lacy, but this isn't exactly a woman's room.
You afraid to try?
Uneasy. Dispassionate. Bored. It's just getting hard to go to work in a good mood. I'm starting to think I've been in the business too long. Last week I did a guy younger than me.
Stop worrying, Colonel. I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.
My father is a Rear Admiral in the Seventh Fleet.
Yeah. We've lived all over the world. Katmandu, Moscow, Nairobi.
No, and I'm not looking for one either.
I hear most of the girls who come to these things are looking for a husband.
What's this?
You know where I live?
You can't do this! You'll get in trouble!
I'm Duff.
Put it back on my head. I'm falling apart here.
I got no ears! I can't hear!
I can't hear you, Nicky. I can't hear anything!
Uh, I'll do my best, Dad. Do you have any advice at all for me?
Okay. Be careful.
Because. I know where he is.
I went back to that restaurant and I spoke with his waiter, just on an off chance, you know, and, anyway-- he knew the name of the guy's hotel. So, I called there, they said he left yesterday. But, apparently he comes here every year, always follows the same route. He always goes from here down the coast to the Le Sirenuse hotel in Positano. I called. And they told me he's checked in.
Fine. Okay. Forget me. Leave me out of it. But don't go throwing your life away on somebody you don't love.
Not bad. You?
But Buzz --
Say, that was a swell idea!
But, Buzz --
And Sid says you stole it!
But, Buzz, you know I never --
The reason I know this and you don't is that I'm younger and purer so I'm more in touch with cosmic forces.
Spike.
Hello. I wonder if I could have a little word.
Your blood.
I can't believe what is happening.
I was dead.
Son of a bitch!
Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
Fats, let's you and I shoot a game of straight pool.
Now I know why they call you Fast Eddie. Eddie, you talk my kind of talk... Sausage! Rack 'em up!
How do you feel?
Can I help you?
Have I? Do you know when I come to think about it it's staggering. If I add it all up I must have spent years waiting for signals. Imagine! An important part of my life wasted between whistles.
No.
No.
Just let me talk to you.
No Roger from op ed?
Love. Who knows what that is? Now circulation, deadlines, those I understand.
Go away. I have enough work here to last me all night.
I'm not going to hurt you! I promise! Please!
Leave.
You've been divorced for two years already. People move on. She has! It's like you enjoy self-pity. Makes you feel special or something.
Is she bringing him to the wedding?
What do you think?
You drop this bombshell on me. Why didn't you tell me before?
To that guy? That guy with the restaurant...
I want to go home now.
Wash her.
Somebody's going to have to wash Mrs. Young. Mary's not here.
"Why-why do you always r-reduce my animal urges to psychoanalytic categories? he said as he removed her brassiere..."
What's fascinating is that it's physical. You know, it's one thing about intellectuals, they prove that you can be absolutely brilliant and have no idea what's going on. But on the other hand... the body doesn't lie, as-as we now know.
Hey, you wouldn't believe this. Two minutes ago, the Knicks are ahead fourteen points, and now... they're ahead two points.
I'll have Mary wash you. Mary!
Hi.
This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?
Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke. I know who I am now, and you don't. And... I don't like me very much.
You have to remember that I love you, that's all that matters --
I don't know anymore. All I see is you.
It put you here. I'll admit it, it acted like a God and put you here, put you into my consciousness. I was asleep, and it put you into my dream. I saw your mouth. And there you were. Whether you've been sent here to make me happy or punish me, it doesn't matter. The decision we make now is all that matters. Stay with me.
All right, Mr. Dodsworth. I think you'll qualify. Take this to that desk over there for further instructions.
Bert, what's happened to this house? Where's Mary? Where's my kids?
Do you know that for sure?
It's mine.
But she expects you to marry her?
She said it was up to me. If I don't, she'll go off and have the baby on her own somewhere.
Fuck the record. Now you listen to me and do exactly what I tell you. Start back ten yards and take off from here. Not here... or there... but right here! No excuses, Seeger! You are going to plant those legs here and then you're going to yank yourself over that wall because you have to! You want jets? Then do it, goddamnit!
It's a big religious thing with her and she won't even discuss it.
Not if she won't even talk about an abortion.
But it would still be my kid. That's the point.
So what's the problem? Girls do that all the time.
I can't let her go off and have the kid by herself and not do anything. If it's my kid, too, then I've got a responsibility, don't I?
Thanks for cleaning my flat and sending my money, all right?... Come on, I need you. It s important.
Did you take your things over to my place?
You know, Frederic-fucking-Chopin.
Enough? Never.
What?
WALKED RIGHT INTO IT.
Do not get ahead of yourself.
It's almost impossible to find, especially on CD. Yet another cruel trick on all of the dumbasses who got rid of their turntables. But every other Echo and the Bunnymen album --
They always seemed what? They always seemed really great, is what they always seemed. They picked up where your precious Echo left off, and you're sitting here complaining about no more Echo albums. I can't believe that you don't own that record. That's insane.
Oh really. Well what about the first Jesus and Mary Chain?
Yes.
Did you go?
Yeh, D. B. Oh, just cleaning out the dead-wood. Okay.
I've already got something worked out. Be seeing you.
No kidding?
Nothing personal. I was just asking.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What for?
Yeah -- fine. Excuse me. I'll be right back.
Hi. It's Frank.
I just wanted to see if my secretary called to confirm your appointment tomorrow.
But since we're both here, I think it's time to take a fresh look at our relationship.
That damn computer has taken over. I'm getting out.
Then Elaine was right.
Striker.
Kurtz, you're drunk. Who's in command of this ship?
Don't talk to me about Elaine. Outta my way!
Pull yourself together! We've got to...
That's always a good idea! Would you like some money? I have a great deal of it.
I know it has been terrible. But it wasn't your fault. And now all the decay is over with and things are going to get better. You understand?
I've got to go, now.
Are you all right?
I'll try.
All in yellow? Oh! That was my father!
Is Mr. Deeds in?
No, thanks.
Go on.
That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
-- and an old wooden hotel of the old California days, and a saloon... dark... low-ceilinged... with hanging oil lamps.
Well, good evening.
Well do whatever it is you do well, and just...just do it. Excuse me...
Yes, I m fine. It s just this god awful football phone! Who has a phone like this anyway?!
Aloha, Mr. Hand!
All right! Oh, yeah!
Aloha, Spicoli.
No, stick around. Can I get you something? Drink? Coffee?
Oh, I don't want to be no bother to nobody.
Hello, Eddie's girl... I looked all over for you.
Oh yeah? How'd you find me?
I asked around.
It's a machine gun. This guy told me when I came to the big city I'd have to have a machine gun, so I bought one. Where do you get the money? To pay for all this? I mean the liquor, and the groceries, and the rent?
Hello, Charlie... C'mon in... That's my girl.
At Widdman High I was considered a pretty hot date, I did a killer frugue.
We're going up the tower, Madeleine.
I don't think so.
I'm a professional killer.
Well, I gotta go. But I'll come back.
Hey... hey. Don't do that.
I can't help it. I can't tell a soul. I didn't even tell Guild.
I want to lie low till I get the whole dope. I don't want to go off half-cocked.
I'm going to get the real murderer. I've got an idea. Want to see me take him?
Got a nice evening dress?
It's hard to believe you're going to be eighteen. Want an eskimo pie? Or a creamsicle? I'd come home from the store and there's little you running up to me. I'd give you a dime and you'd promise never to grow up.
For me?
Doing some shopping?
Don't be cruel to a heart that's true.
Good, you got your money out of that greedy bank.
Does it have wheat in it?
Yeah.
--it didn't come out of a cereal box.
Everybody on the border knows that story.
You know the popular version of how he left town.
Skull was intact, no soft tissue left--not much to go on.
You got a cause of death?
Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
Well you know what I mean.
She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
You uhm--you remember what old Buddy carried for a side arm?
No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
So he could have gone out to the base, hopped the fence, dug down into the dirt on the old rifle range and had a heart attack.
Farm...
I'm on the side of our Mother Holy Church. Besides, a confession under torture will never convince anyone of her guilt.
We're going up the tower.
You won't be able to drag anything from her that way. You also must realize that many of my colleagues are... well, scared...
Okay, but if I get yelled at, I'm never gonna listen to this show again.
Scared to make a mistake. Supposing she's right... supposing she really has been sent by God??
Is it true that you launched an attack on Paris?
It was on a Sunday, wasn't it?
Do you think is was a good idea to launch an attack on a holy day?
But they were Indians themselves.
But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
I got a single room.
Yes -- I think that would be good.
No sports if I don't keep a B average, no TV on school nights, no PDA's--
He's a pretty tough old man, huh?
You work too hard, Pop.
Anyway, I gotta get to this meeting. Tell your Mom I'm gonna be late.
I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
You're going to be in office for exactly two days more and then we're pulling your nose out of the feed bag.
What?
And you've forgotten yours.
I just gotta get somethin'.
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes...
Nice guy. Just like you. But he made a big mistake, one day. Got kind of talkative. Know what happened? His kid was found in the bottom of the river. A rock tied around its neck. Poor Bugs! He couldn't take it. Blew his brains out.
No.
Okay. Just remember that. Now beat it.
Gee! That musta been terrible. I guess he had it coming to him though. But don't you worry about me. I don't talk. I never talk. Take my word for it. Gee, I wouldn't want anything to happen to my kids.
You'll keep your trap shut, all right.
Oh, gee, Mister you wouldn't you ain't thinkin' about
If you don't Ever hear of Bugs Dooley?
Sure sure I'll keep my trap shut. you can depend on me, Mister.
Come on, scram! And stay away from that bus.
Oh, thanks, thanks, Mister. I always knew you guys were kind-hearted.
Where's my damn ammo? Nothing is ever where it's supposed to be around here!
All over? I kept trying to cover a very modest portion and still failed. Are you leaving us? Now's our opportunity to swap war wounds.
Oh, yes ... Well, that's not so easy. Beginnings are always difficult.
I'm going to. It's my second chance.
What happened?
Yeah? So you up for a game later?
I'm sorry, Danny, but they're only accepting the best pilots.
You don't wanna hurt your back.
That's better. I can tell you got yourself some education. Them's good hands you got, Homer. Them hands you got, they know what they're doin'-- ain't that right?
And you picked it out of my plate before I could answer and it felt so intimate like we were already lovers.
You're the one who's helping me , Homer. You're going to give my mom a little peace of mind while I'm gone. Candy, too.
I don't think so, Homer. I'm the lucky one.
You know what I did.
You said --
No -- actually I'm not --
You don't exactly look like drug dealers.
Alright. This is really great. Alright, we're going out. It's a date. It's a scam. Whatever, whatever, alright, I'll pick you up at what, eight O' clock?
If we're for real?
My name is John Ferguson, and --
What's that, peanut?
What happened to him?
You tell the boy who knocked you up?
I been working on a few things.
What is it? A sapphire?
Sixteen weeks is a long time.
No, nothing.
Okay. Goodbye.
Nicky, the worst thing that could happen on Earth is you get killed, in which case, boom, you end up back here.
You are.
Because that would be too easy.
Ok.
Great.
Where were you? I called at 4:30 this morning.
Severance pay. And I'm going to cash in my life insurance policy.
You can't go with me because of Sam?
So am I, Robin. I'm working at something, too. I'm even talking. Do you want to be around for it?
What?!
That's my son! My son is dead!
You're sorry? YOU'RE THE REASON WE'RE HERE!
I'm not going out there! Let's wait for the real police...
You know what? You can go.
I don't know. I ain't seen him all night.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, he never... well... he's got a girl up at the Blue Parrot. He goes up there all the time.
Not tonight no more. He ain't coming. Uh, he went home.
Leave him alone, Miss Ilsa. You're bad luck to him.
So, how long you've been living here?
Yeah.
This won't take long. I'm shooting tomorrow morning. I just need to do some prep work.
Would you do me a favor and go to the truck? Inside that leather bag with the pockets is a package of lens cleaners. Would you grab me one?
Where the music's playing and the ladies are...
No pain, Mr. Kringelein?
Pain? Oh, no, Doctor. I think if I had pain I'd be too happy to notice it...
...and let me say again for the tenth time... ...you people were quite ready for the merger. You declared yourselves... fully agreed on all the terms -- Why should the signing of these articles be suddenly held up?
I've admitted that at one time we had reason for desiring ther merger -- What reason have we now? The Preysing Company has fallon upon evil days, very evil days.
Evil days -- I've shown you here -- -- my company exports to the Balkans alone, sixty-five thousand marks worth of mop rags a year.
Mop rags -- mop rags -- we're interested in something quite different!
What?
Why waste time -- it's getting late.
Been telling you that all along, lad.
That's it! The unbreakable line! We'll tie it to an arrow and fire it up into the timbers above the portculis... then, I'll climb up and chop down the drawbridge.
Will you chance a miss?
You'll do it because I am you liege and I command you to do it!
He's not hurt. He's okay. Look at him.
Nobody. Just a girl I've been making it with the last couple of weekends.
Who's that?
I'm sorry. I can't sit with you.
Naw. You're alone in this world no matter what kinda folks or background you had. Nothing hurts, pard, once you got that one down.
The thing that really got to me... she didn't leave a note. Nothing. I've always hated her for that.
Wannabee nigger...
You shouldn't be driving. Where are you?
Yes? Marylin?
We'll be loaded with 2,000 pounds of bombs and 1,500 pounds of fuel. I got another Chinese phrase for Doolittle. "Mug wump rickshaw mushu pork." It means "Who the fuck thought up this shit?"
She's coming with us.
Jesus Christ, what were you doing in there?
Okay, honey, come on out of there.
Shit...
We may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?
Uh-huh. Well, but if --
Where in the hell are we?
That's the turnpike up there. Glenn's waiting with the other car.
Erin? What are you --
Careful...careful.
Behind you.
Be careful not to break the laser beams.
You want me to write down all your messages?
Two? That's it?
Yeh, I wrote a couple down.
So -- any messages?
Groovy. You should do more of this stuff.
No, they were prescription, so I could see all the fishes properly.
There's something wrong with the goggles though...
Right. Vicious circle. And then I was like rooting around in your things, and found this, and I thought -- cool. Kind of spacey.
Boy, you're really into this.
Any more soda left?
I was thinking that, uh...you know, while I was up there and all...that maybe I could, you know...try to meet a girl. I've, been thinking about that a little...just these last...fifteen years or so.
Yes, ma'am.
Funny story. You see, me and a buddy of mine decided to... ah... you know... just... drive down.
I don't rattle, kid. But just for that I'm gonna beat you flat.
Huh.
You quittin', friend?
I'm crazy about you. By the way, your pin.
What the hell, lots of my heroes killed themselves. Hemingway, Van Gogh... um... Herve Villachaise...
How about a drink?
Okay.
What's on your mind?
Peanut...
Jerry is dangerous. Jerry has killed --
Belief is immaterial. What's important is the truth... It's been my job to find Jerry. I'm very much responsible for him.
Good man. Now can I have my arms back?
How do you know it's mine? We only did it once.
What? Now?
I told her today I need to end it.
What's going on?
She trusts me. She'll do what I say.
Koontz! Let her come in! Claire! It's pitch dark in here! You're gonna have trouble seeing anything, so just come in, and straight down a long hall. Then stand at the door so we can see you. We want to see your face and we won't be able to until you get to the kitchen door!
I want your guarantee they'll be turned loose when she opens the front door.
Let my kid go.
Get that gun away from his head, or I'll keep her from coming in! Put the gun on me, he can't hurt you! He's tied up! Put him under the table!
Put him under the table or I'll stop her from coming in.
And now that Wally's coming back, and because he'll certainly need you...
I helped you not to think about Wally. You were so upset--you couldn't stand worrying about him, about his being killed and not coming back-- but when you were with me, you could stop worrying... well, for a while, anyway. This is how I helped you, right?
"...did." Well, okay.
Who live here in this cider house, Peaches? Who grind them apples, who press that cider, who clean up the mess, and who just plain live here... just breathin' in the vinegar? Somebody who don't live here made them rules. Them rules ain't for us . We the ones who make up them rules. We makin' our own rules, every day. Ain't that right, Homer?
No, that's not it--I just want to be sure I understand you.
Oh...oh...oh, shit!
Well, okay. There's this girl...
Yeah, thanks.
And the next one...?
Here. How about some breakfast?
Oh -- of course. I think there's a new toothbrush somewhere.
Sure I do. It's always nice to have company for Christmas.
Miss Kubelik, I'm stronger than you are --
You're in no condition to go anywhere -- except back to bed.
Two o'clock.
Here...I just would like to help you. I thought...maybe...you could use some money.
Goodnight. Don't worry. I won't keep her out late.
Do you follow her every day?
Not.
My feelings exactly.
Thanks, but... we've got plans.
Hi.
It wouldn t really be cheating... It s complicated.
I'm gonna meet her in front of the Beekman. I think I have a few minutes left. Right?
So could you write down her exact address?
Of what?
Get it!
C mon, Evelyn Thompson s got no class. She doesn t marry Dr. Steve, the woman s living in a trailer.
Mary, we haven't seen each other in twelve years. Don't make me wait another day.
I can die trying.
I haven't been touched in years.
You know what mortise and tenon is?
Stage four pancreatic cancer. They haven't even pretended to offer treatment. You tell me, when would you start eating red meat?
Farmer! I knew it! You're a vic- tim, Willow. Yep, you and me: victims of a rotten, corrupt, cor- rupt, rotten world.
Farmer.
You a woodcutter?
How's that? We can't drink our piss can we?
You must find some glasses, small, for the toast, and some plates.
Hang on hang on, sorry, but like, who are you?
Sorry. You've lost me...
What are you doing here?
What?
I'm asking what you're here for.
Yep--spending lots of time aboard--you see, Sally, I sold this Transatlantic idea to the shipping company.
What's that?
O.K., kid-- I'm only sorry for one thing.
It's all there. It's no dream.
No, that was the most fun I've ever had without laughing.
No, no, I-I-i, uh, I don't use any major hallucinogenics because I took a puff like five years ago at a party and
I tried to take my pants off over my head... ...my ear.
M'hm. You're not gonna believe this, but-
Hey?
Well, we might as well start filling it in now. As long as you leave enough room around that end of the pipe - so I can get to it, we're set. Use them wooden boards to stop it all spilling into the space - We'll neaten it up later.
Not bad hey, I think I'll add Sparkie to my resume.....Good shovel!
Later Mate, right now I've got to do the locks on these doors so we don't have to climb through that bloody window every time.
I'll drill the locks and replace the barrels, that way it won't cost so much.
How do you know what I'm going to say?
Another little problem.
The show must you know
Go on.
Juliet does not come on for twenty pages. It will be all right.
How will it?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
You're right.
I've never sent a letter like that, you know? I mean, I felt like I wanted to tell you something, but I didn't put it in the letter, and I didn't say it, but I want to say it now, I'm not sure if I should say it, you know, 'cause people always say it and don't mean it, but I think that I mean it, so, um, I just wanted to tell you...
Dad--answer her--aren't you going to stand up for me?
Why didn't you tell me?
There it is. I'm broke.
The night is two thousand dollars old.
That seems a shame. The night is young.
All right, then. I'll play him with my own money.
.....1274 Moorpark. Sherman Oaks, California. 4. 91403.
...3407 2627 3444 8095 expiration 05 04.
Better make it doughnuts, huh?
They're...
Yeh. Say, how much money we got left?
You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies?
Tell me about the purity.
You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?
Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick!
No wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright.
This doesn't concern you, Foley. Why don't you go on out to the yard, have yourself a smoke?
Meaning time came, I left.
Good, wait here, it will not take long and then you may go.
Waddaya getting so sore about?
I looked all over for you last night, you know that?
I told you I need to work in peace. Remember? I need to concentrate.
It's difficult.
The words you're looking for weren't in the dictionary you studied. I won't be long.
What do you want for Sam?
It's not for sale at any price.
You haven't heard my offer.
It's not for sale.
Fine, but I would like to buy your cafe.
Hello, Ferrari. How's business at the Blue Parrot?
Hello, Rick.
-- tell me something -- did you talk about me?
Did you?
Yeah, I know. Did you?
That's too bad. That's Casablanca's leading commodity. In refugees alone we could make a fortune if you would work with me through the black market.
I don't buy or sell human beings.
Uh-huh. Lived there till I was twenty or so and then moved to Chicago when I got married.
After the divorce.
I can't describe it. I think it's from the loam in the soil. This very rich, earthy kind of... alive... No. No, that's not right. Can you smell it?
That must be it. It's a great smell.
How long you been married?
You and Robin moved?
Well, Ted, to tell you the truth, I found out through the grapevine that it might be, and I only said might be, the Drexl Spivey that was responsible for that restaurant break-in on Riverdale.
It's about that pimp that was shot a couple of days ago, Drexl Spivey.
I don't know him. Is he a nice guy? You think he'll help me out?
Yeah, and the restaurant's on my route. And you know, I stuck my nose in for the company to try to put a stop to some of these break-ins. Now, while I have no proof, the name Drexl Spivey kept comin' up Who's case is it?
I'm not losing the bet. It's just taking longer than I expected.
Nothing.
I know. I'm sorry. I'll make a fire. I'll be back.
I promise I'll come back. I promise I'll never leave you. And there's plenty of water and food. You can have a party.
My God... did you get a look at who did it?
You did? Was it anyone that you...?
Uh-huh.
Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
Hurts. Hurts pretty bad.
Kramer, the WORP control handle just came off in my hand.
You think I'm kidding. You're the Most fallible, wrong-headed, self- Deluding, just generally Benighted jackass I've ever Known. Yet, withal, even at your Worst, you're the only human Being in my entire life who ever Gave me hope.
All right, Doc...
Bet there's a few things you could teach me. Kendo, for one.
You understand the psychology of the job.
I work alone.
Sometimes I am. Sometimes. It's only natural.
No.
You're not nothing, Erin.
You are someone.
I go for this stuff. You know this city's full of hawks? There must be twenty thousand of 'em. They perch on top of the big hotels and swoop down on the pigeons in the park.
I like pigeons. You send a bird five hundred miles away he won't stop for food or water until he's back in his own coop.
He had a few birds. I got up and fed 'em this morning.
I started them Golden Warriors. I was their first Supreme Commander.
'That right? I thought he was up North.
Make sure he gets those shots.
Oh come on, that's ridic -
Look, the best scientific mind in this country is working on your case. May I make a suggestion?
No offense, but you're pretty out of it now.
You are completely relaxed. When I count to three, you will open your eyes. One... two... three. We'll start with something easy. What is your name?
Everything. This is perfect. The subconscious mind remembers all. You can give me more information on microchips and then pinpoint what happened at the reunion. Maybe that'll give us a clue on how to get you back.
Oh boy. Peggy, what are microchips?
Whatcha looking in there for? We can't afford any of that.
I got him in the stomach.
He didn't say anything to me about it.
"There goes another novel." Jesus, you were great.
Tell him what you want, Muddy-- you is the crew boss today.
"One: Please don't smoke in bed."
"Two: Please don't go up to the roof to eat your lunch."
Why deny it? The more you deny, the more they print. Let them alone! The thing to do is to sit still and keep our traps shut.
Well, at best you might deny it.
You quit trying to stop anybody
I've tried to stop the evening papers, but it's useless.
What magic have we on our side?
Yes - the worm!
Stay off it.
Fuck you.
That's right. I wasn't there. I don't have the luxury of being a witness to tragedy.
You weren't there.
No, let's stay on it. I'm sick and tired of watching you make him up into some kinda god. For Christ sake, Jack, he died doing a stupid bullshit jig. He left a wife and two sons. He wasn't a hero. He was a fool.
No, fuck you. And fuck him too. Fuck the both-of you.
Faerie magic's no match for a sorcerer's power... We have Ogg's gifts, the key and the --
I'm done with her now. Tonight really creeped me out.
There must be some way to get it up there.
Yes sir. I do, Sir.
Sir. I was going Mach point one five.
Yes sir.
Said what?
There, you said it.
Why can't you be serious?
Well, there's your trouble right there -- you're too old for me.
I'm not fifteen.
So was Juliet -- at fifteen.
Oh-oh -- here it comes. The fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow.
Reggie -- listen to me --
I hope it turns out you're a Whitefoot, Alex -- I could be very happy hanging around the tepee.
C'mon big 'un, you're okay...
Catholic school, nasty.
How can you be sure?
Luck be with you, Sam. Sam ?
George is going to open a shop.
Cute. No, 'cause no one's ever made it from Atlanta to Texarkana and back in twenty-eight hours.
For a new Kenworth. That's a truck.
I never looked at it that way. You ask a lot of questions.
It's not a truck. It's the Rolls Royce of eighteen-wheelers.
Hey, you were never going to give me the money.
Why should that make such a difference?
Oh, I don't know. I think proms are pretty dumb.
A real Clydesdale, huh Warren?
We're here, Warren. You wanna get off?
Huh?
And Miles is my best man, Mrs. Raymond. My main man.
This Saturday, Mom, remember? We told you.
Nonono. Marylin -- I'm your husband. I'd be entitled to Rex's money. No matter what happened to you.
Uh-huh. I'll be right back.
Yeah, I remember the girl who was in it with me. She was something.
Oh, that was for, uh, wait... That was for Spray and Wash.
Oh. Fine.
What's with the cameras?
Hundredth cabinet meeting. I thought it was a nice touch.
Do you like it?
Of course not, David. I'll fetch in young Miss Price.
You're a very beautiful girl.
Dr. Hirsch? I'd rather not be by myself.
But going in that church, I'd be stooling for you, Charley. You make a pigeon out of me.
Yeah. Neat.
I wanted to apologize, Susan --
Well, that's very interesting.
I thought so, too. Joe's a neat guy.
Wow! Well now-there-then!
Well, now I am sorry. For intruding on you this afternoon.
Isn't it crazy?
No bits of bone, no particles of scalp, no strands of hair?
No. I'm scared.
Of course that doesn't jibe with what we found. This was an angry killing.
That's what we are, we keep each other on track. Prior to this day, we've postured. We've procrastinated. We've pretended. We've -- well I can't think of other p-words, but we've probably done them too.
This is different. This is better. Think of when you're working out, Oz. You need a partner, someone to spot you. Someone to keep you motivated.
Don't take any chances. Shoot through the desk.
There's no one here, and I've got to talk to you.
That doesn't matter -- You don't really have to be a whore, just act like one an' that's it.
This is absurd. Besides Feldman's an allergist. If you're going to do something, do it right.
I know you would, Wrigley. But would Kramer?
That viper has envenomed the water. No animal will drink here now.
It doesn't seem right, this being down here. It ought to be where people can see it.
Unicorn?
All right. I'll show you something sacred.
Stop complaining.
Only were he a fool to boot. See yon viper?
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
I'm not crazy about the "Little..."
We haven't had a Wilbur here in a year or so, have we? We used to have dozens !
Not much more. Big day in the big city. What's on your mind?
No, honey. Go back to sleep.
C mon, Jack...
You can t do this. You can t keep coming in and out of people s lives, messing things up...
So, you're really gonna be a lawyer?
No.
No.
Yes.
Do you want some dinner?
That was amazing. Thanks so much. You didn't have to do that.
You think I'm a tourist?
Allison, I trust you. This is your thing.
So what do you think?
We were hungry.
Oh. Oh! Has Miss Dawson called yet?
Miss Dawson, sir? No, sir. No Miss Dawson has called, sir.
Prairie? Oysters?
Yes, sir. It makes the head feel smaller.
I'd better call her up and apologize. I don't remember taking her home last night.
I'd venture to say, sir, you don't remember much of anything that happened last night, sir.
She was a lady in distress. She wouldn't let me help her. Got a lot of pride. I like that.
Oh, I do too, sir.
A sink?
And if I enclosed it?
Did you got through my pants?
I might have a solution.
Where is it?
A friend of yours is here.
I'm not lookin' to get crucified. I'm lookin' to stay in one piece.
Yeah, yeah... . This Father Barry, what's his racket?
How did they get our phone number?
Makes your breath like garbage.
It's the best thing there is.
I teach these classes I've taught for a million years. The spontaneity went out of it for me a long time ago. I started off, I was excited about something and I wanted to share it. Now it's rote, it's the multiplication table. Except sometimes. Sometimes I'm droning along and I look up, and there's this fresh young beautiful face, and it's all new to her and I'm this great guy who's just brilliant and thinks out loud. And when that happens, when I look out among those chairs and look at a young woman's face, and see me there in her eyes, me the way I always wanted to be and maybe once was, then I ask her out on a date. It doesn't last. It can go for a few weeks or a couple of precious months, but then she catches on that I'm just a burnt out old gasbag and that she's as fresh and bright and full of promise as moonlight in a martini. And at that moment, she stands up and throws a glass of water in my face, or some action to that effect.
I like your dress. It's very bright.
I don't know. I got a feeling.
I'll be up later.
Just him and that's it. Okay, you can answer -- we've worked it out.
Okay, you're not dead, but according to every law of science what you say happened to you is impossible.
'Cause that's the way guys are -- They laugh when ya talk dirty. They think ya cute for a while, but then ya getta reputation an' watch out. Nobody's ever gonna take ya serious. Ya get no respect... I gotta use a bad word -- Whore. You'll end up maybe becomin' a whore.
Some kid hittin' .300 in Lynchburg ...probably a bust.
Is it true?
Singed a bit, were you?
This will all soon be but a happy memory because Roberts' ship "Revenge" is anchored at the far end. And I, as you know, am Roberts.
Exactly. And then -- maybe -- not right away -- There's a room right off the bedroom -- It would be perfect for a nursery. It's a walk in humidor right now -- but if I took out the refrigeration unit --
I think a nursery should be right off the master suite. My parents put mine in the guest house. Apparently they did have a Fisher Price intercom, but my mother turned it off when I was seven months old because I was so --
Uncle Louis. He's a 75 year old amazing guy, isn't he?
Johana... New York.
He doesn't hear too well.
Yeah. Took me a year before I could bend my knee -- but I got over the girl in three weeks. She still lives in Cincinnati, has four kids, gained twenty pounds -- she sends me a fruit cake every Christmas.
Of course not. Here's the fruit cake. And you want to see my knee?
So let 'em. Look, I'm going to cook dinner for us. We'll have the fruit cake for dessert. You just sit there and rest. You've done enough for one day.
"...Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Write, write--"I just wanta give It my best shot and, Good Lord willing, things'll work out."
Jesus.
Of course. That's the point. "I'm just happy to be here and hope I can help the ballclub."
You outta your mind? If you give in now you might start losing. Never fuck with a winning streak.
She's getting steamed 'cause I'm still re-channeling my sexual energy--maybe I should cave in and sleep with her once just to calm her down. What'ya think?
Yep. So how's Annie?
How come in former lifetimes, everybody was someone famous? How come nobody ever says they were Joe Schmo?
Sometimes, there's a twi-night double-header. A nebbish like you!
I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
Yeah. Well -- see you, Doc.
When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
Me?
He has a gun, Mr. Bartholomew -- I saw it.
Who?
Dyle, or whatever his name is.
What does your Mr. Dyle look like, Mrs. Lampert?
What did you want to see me about, Mr. Bartholomew?
Were you followed?
Yes, but I lost him. I really did it quite brilliantly. I'm beginning to think women make the best spies.
Agents.
Me.
Describe him.
Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
I forget to tell you. I'm running blocker for four hundred cases of illegal brew.
Anything?
What do you think? What's this?
All right. Five hundred.
Well... who are those guys?
But...
Sit down.
All part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late.
I don't know. Probably not.
I take thee at thy word.
Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike.
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes, And but thou love me, let them find me here: My life were better ended by their hate, Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
Don't go, Jackie...
So you think this is worth a thousand dollars, do you?
Not at all!
No, no, no, the gal's right. We can't let the Chronicle get the laugh on us! We've got to produce a John Doe now. Amateur journalism, huh! I'll show those guys.
Have you forgotten? I don't need any samples where I'm going.
I have your samples ready.
No, but you might need them when you get back.
Where are you going?
In case you get back before I do.
Thank you.
I'm travelling too.
Mister, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna kick 100 of your ass.
He insulted me first. He called me a moron.
Yes, sir.
Describe Mallory? Okay. She's pretty, she's got blonde hair, two eyes, two feet, two hands, ten fingers...
No, Your Honor.
I've got work to do.
I didn't hear it.
Says the United States of America.
When have they ever been right?
And remember this, Bruce! I love her, too.
I'm beginning to realize that.
You're my friend, Gus.
Why not?
No, Bruce, you didn't come between us. It was all over for her before you came on the scene. For me -- it'll never be over.
And the beauty of it is she'll never have to know 'till I've passed on. Maybe she'll think kindly of me --- after I'm gone.
Gee, you almost make me feel like a heel -- coming between you.
She's right. You got an icepick in you yet?
Catherine says you don't like her.
Well, Bruce, here you are -- certified and everything.
I don't believe it.
You know that stuff they say about how you can judge people by their friends?
He asked if I had an icepick in me yet.
You have an ATM?
Nothing....I mean, really...change, nothing....that's the cash I have....
Is this where you live?
Yes.
You have another house somewhere or something?
Yes.
No.
Don't leave me...
That time?
Yeah. That was the ninth.
Nervous. Couldn't sleep. Feel like a nightcap?
She did, huh.
You must be some kinda walker, Henry.
Ten, you count the prison hospital in Ohio I walked away from.
Oh, you're the great Joe's attorney now? Are we going to go to court? Or are we going to go to bed? And I don't mean you and me. I mean you and him.
You first.
Not good, not bad, you know what we got? Nothing. No credit, no cars, no mortgages -- no wives. Nothing.
No, I don't --
No, thanks. I've promised to play cards.
How about you?
Mr. Rose knows ?
Great.
What!
Yeah, and when those suppers are disrupted because there's a car crash, or there's a fire, or a little boy steps on a beehive.
I know that, but what do you want from me?
What do you do?
Every year.
Then suppose you give me the money. Four hundred and fifty dollars.
Thank you.
Hildy! Where's mother?
Did you give her the money?
Come on, Hildy, we've got to keep going! Sorry, Bruce, but --
And I'll take that certified check, too. I've decided I can handle things around here...
If I ever won a pot that large the boat would sink.
I wanted to see you...
Joe, that's the kitchen.
Not exactly.
Shook me up. I mean that you knew her and everything --
'Threw' you? Where?
The complete works of Timothy J. Nolan.
She can't really love that idiot, can she?
The Center Counter Defense. The thing is not to move your queen too early.
Got any symptoms?
You'd meet doctors, lawyers -- nothing wrong with them necessarily if they're divorced. Why settle for some cowboy cop who drinks too much and cheats on his wife? That's the way those hotshots are, all of 'em.
What're you doing at Glades?
Then they're not separated, are they?
You used to like it.
You know you can always step in, work with me full-time as one of my investigators.
The fish saved my life. Two years ago, I found out I had high blood pressure. So my doctor, he tells me to go get an aquarium, look at the fish every time I felt myself stressing out.
And the guy sent you a bill for this?
Doyle Oil? A Massey Pre-nup? She loves him.
Don't do her no good to go into a tree.
Sorry.
I said, she's in great shape.
The fish?
I can't say that I've paid that much attention to 'em before.
Bella -- this is Anna.
No, I mean, what city, what state are you in?
No.
Where are you?
Hi. This is Jack.
Nothing.
I really don't know.
Well, fuck that shit, we'll get some real food. What would taste good. What do you think would taste good?
I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
No. Yes. There's just one more thing I'd like to get off my chest before I finish.
Uh, yeah... there's a party store down 54th.
I'll come to the wedding.
But he wants me to come!
Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
Look, I'm sorry about this, but I'd like "the Upsetter" by Lee "Scratch" Perry, in there. Instead of "Sin City."
Ahhh...A little high on the left, don't you think?
Look, Ma, top of the world!
We did it!
I wouldn't call it victory. It's more like...self immolation.
It's a victory roll.
Right.
Yeah.
Hi...Hi there. How ya doing in there? Mav... Ahhh...you know, at one point I did want a Navy career.
No.
Who? Oh. My friend. My friend is Laura. A girl. A friend who's a girl.
What are you going to tell the little ones?
Responding officers found minors, marijuana, and cheap wine coolers when they responded to a call to break up a party at what Southglen High Schoolers have come to call "The Court." Seventeen-year-old Kristen Rey says, "Yeah, everyone who's anyone is at The Court on Saturday night."
Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
That's what I'd come here for. I'd watch the movie.
How could you not care about the movie?
I'd better go report this...
I won't come.
What's the matter with you, Buddy- boy? I made a reservation for four o'clock, remember?
You can't come in.
What do I -- ? Just a minute.
What do you want?
Hi, Baxter.
Gin.
You sure you want to throw that card?
This is not the time for squabbling.
Screwball! You dolt! I've a mind to change you into a toad.
Shhhh!
Go ahead. Jump right on into my nightmare. The water's warm. 65.
Okay?
Why, at this juncture, are you letting yourself be so concerned by business matters?
I was just asking. Are you all right?
Bathroom.
Did you drink and dial?
Absolutely.
Fine. Just slipped. This is my blood.
What if you have a concussion? My dog went to sleep with a concussion and woke up a vegetable. Not that I could tell the difference...
Pull yourself together, man.
I'm fine!
Where were you?
You're quick.
And a good thing too.
Come back to me.
Yes.
Just fine. What's the weather like?
Here. Hold her.
You okay?
We ain't got all fuckin' day!
I'm very sorry about that. I apologize.
Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
I bet you do!
Beware of the Puget Debs -- and we all laughed, especially him.
Come on, Paula! You were looking for a ticket out of here and you didn't care who it was, any more than you cared with the last class of candidates you and Lynette fucked your way through, looking for a husband! Or the class before that!
That's brilliant.
Well, she probably had a deadline...
...You know! For kids!
You know, I was thinkin', maybe We ought to open our own place. That's the real money. Build it Up, milk it for all it's worth, Then sell it off for a bundle and Breeze out of this burg with more Money than Croesus and ready to Live like kings. Let's you and me Take a walk around town, Virge, See if we can scout us out a Couple of nice lots.
Yep, it's all yours.
Donations only! And make the thing non-lingual, so everyone gets a handle on it.
Look, if you can get them to finish it by Friday, you and your friends can do the opening performance that night.
There's three thousand crowns, it's all I got.
Well, I want them to put down a floor and a walkway.
I can't, I have to go home.
Sure. 'Course. Rob, look. Do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?
I understand, Dick.
Or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. I mean, he liked Laura too, I didn't mean that. And he likes you. It's just that --
I'll start with your news before I tell him mine, obviously. Mine isn't much, really, just about Marie LaSalle playing at Lounge Ax tonight. I like her, you know, she's kind of Sheryl Crowish... but, you know, good. So I'll tell him before that. Good news and bad news kind of thing.
Fine.
I've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. I'll just tell him about, you know, Laura, when I tell him the other stuff.
'Course I will, Rob. No problem. No problem at all. I'll tell him next time I see him.
There's a couple of points I keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. Buddy is it? And this fella Jack Foley. I swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.
What'd you talk about?
You talked to him?
This fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?
Come on, I'll drive you in this thing.
His wife had twins and he went out to celebrate and got as drunk as a lord. They can't even find him. I tell you, drink is the ruin of this nation.
Just Sweeney again. One of my best reporters.
Anything the matter?
Say, what's happened to Burns? He looks sunk, doesn't he?
Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house. All we did was write her name down.
I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you?
Just what is the lowdown on Williams?
So -- Sweeney gets twins -- and Earl Williams gets hanged tomorrow.
You got something on the coke?
I would have missed it -- but the phone rang and I let it play while I talked. It looks like blank tape -- but it isn't. It's been erased without any input signal coming in.
So, what good is it to us if it's been erased?
Trail him! Trail who?
I'm going back with you.
I guess he turned out to be kind of a loser, huh?
What about easier to hit in an air raid?
Alright, personalised flight care from Corey. Books, cassettes, magazines, anything?
I didn't want to leave without saying how much I admire your jewelry.
Sir? I would really appreciate it if you wouldn't take the Lord's name in vain again.
Yes, ma'am. But my name is Adam.
Holy Christ. You want to get us killed?
Whoa, Ike. Getting a complex, buddy?
How ya doing? Is she around?
Hello Lloyd.
How reliable is this kid?
Yeah.
Do I look like I need your money. It doesn t work like that and I can t tell you why.
As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
Look, I just want my life back. Now what s it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Let s talk turkey! How much money...?
Figure it out. You got plenty of time.
How much time?!
It feels a little confined here. Let's take a walk.
Maybe we could live without the wise cracks.
Boyfriend?
Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
It relaxes me... I'd feel better just sitting on the curb in front of your house than anyplace else I can think of or imagine.
Right, Del. Del was one hot salesman. Of cars. He could talk anyone into anything.
Honey, I didn't want to tell you at the time, but Del and I go way back. We went to school together. In fact, he saved my life. Two more minutes in that icy water and I would have drowned. But Del jumped in and grabbed me. We fell out of touch eventually, but I still owe him one.
Why are you so determined to keep me alive?
I can see my wife in that view.
I understand.
This? Oh, that's a matter of simple mathematics. These cabins cost two bucks a night and I'm very sorry to inform you, wifey dear, but the family purse won't stand for our having separate establishments.
You made your decision yet?
Now we just gotta figure out how to get there.
Uh huh. You beat me three times.
No. Goodbye. Thanks for nothing.
Hey. Aren't you gonna talk me into it?
Yes, you already did.
Stu, you have my absolute confidence. - DEAD MAN! DEAD MAN WALKING!!
Fine! Don't put yourself out. I'll go to the land of Death alone.
You've been working on this, huh?
Chalk up one for your side. Now listen, you want to get to King Westley, don't you? All right, I'm here to help you. What I want is your story, exclusive. A day-to- day account. All about your mad flight to happiness. I need that story. Just between you and me I've got to have it.
Hi.
Yeah, kind of.
Thanks for inviting me over. Where's the little guy?
I'm glad you're home. That "alone" thing is... not my specialty...
You don't want to learn.
I don't want to learn.
Hah, you're very cunning Ada, but I've seen through you, I'm not going to lose the land this way. Wait here!
I don't think you should have given up the piano. I will make sure you are properly taught, with music written on to sheets and...
The biggest. The biggest movie you've ever dealt with, Lee. We're talkin' a lot of film. A man'd have ta be an idiot not to be a little cautious about a movie like that. And Lee, you're no idiot.
Forgot my car keys. What are you doing on the fourth floor?
What's the matter with you?
Wyatt, they're threatening our lives.
He's looking right at me.
He could see me.
I'll quit, maybe you should start.
What is this -- some kind of... Joke? Are we playing games again?
You did.
Well, take them off.
All right! Don't take them off. Do whatever you please. But shut up about it.
What's the matter?
I drove -- I drove Mrs. Robinson home. She wanted me to drive her home so I -- I drove her home.
She's upstairs. She wanted me to wait down here till you got home.
All right? That's wonderful! It's the Majestic -- 44th Street.
Swell. I appreciate it.
You know, I felt so lousy this morning -- a hundred and one fever -- then my promotion came up -- now you and I -- eleventh row center -- and you said I should have stayed in bed.
All this business of war -- do you get scared?
They got a great little band at El Chico, in the Village -- it's practically around the corner from where you live.
Europe... France. I m French but I live in London... ... England.
You wouldn t have a cigarette, would you?
And I asked someone. CHARLIE You think you're pretty smart.
Where's Anna?
Figures. Anybody seen my scope?
I knew you would, pal. A bird in a gilded cage, eh?
Pay attention? I'm not paying any attention to him. You think that guy could get me upset? Hah! Not that mug. He's a tough mug - hard, cynical. He doesn't know the fine things in life - that guy. A bird in a gilded cage, huh? It's getting so a guy can't step out without being called a magnolia. Stew Smith, a magnolia! Not me. Say, I'm not going to hang around and be a speakeasy rat all my life! I'll tell you that. Not me, not me. I'm going to step out and mean something in this world. You watch me. Say, am I a lucky guy to be near Anne Schuyler? I've been hit with a carload of horseshoes, and believe me I know it. Lucky, I'll say I'm lucky! Don't you think I'm lucky, Gallagher?
No!
'For he's only a bird in a gilded cage, a beautiful sight to see ' Tweet, tweet - ha, ha
I'm not quitting!
No?
Five years ago. November.
Right. It was someone's birthday. Halloran?
Yeah.
Jesus, when was the last time we played the Mallory?
She asked for it.
I told Halloran we didn't do vocals, but he said:
Daughter's. Sweet sixteen.
Christ, that's right. How could I forget. What a nightmare.
Colonel...we're all going. Whether you make it or not.
Better to have an insane spouse than a criminal one.
You know something?
You watch too much television.
It's a bit beyond my... range, shall we say.
I can think of worse ways to go--
Yes, he's tired. I believe so.
You told your dad?
Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
Was there a shark? Did you see a shark?
What is that? What are you doing with your hands? Talk to me, you're talking like that girl Sheila.
Because. They know the evidence; they know they're gonna lose a jury trial. Maybe they wouldn't lose 400 million bucks, but once you factor in all they'd spend on this case in the next ten years, it makes a lot of --
Leon didn t hang himself, Deborah. Your husband killed him and made his death look like suicide. How did he do it, eh? Strangulation? Drugs? No doubt an autopsy will tell.
Uh-huh.
With nothing linking it to the corporate offices yet, I'd say we'll end up on the lower end of that. Still a lot of money.
I'm not gonna fire you. I wanted to. But then you got sick, and that woulda made me look like a shit. You embarrassed me, Erin.
I'm sorry.
I love you too honey.
You're tough, J-man.
Well what the fuck do you expect me to do about it.
Yeah, its really different here.
O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes In shape no bigger than an agate-stone On the fore-finger of an alderman, Drawn with a team of little atomies Over men's noses as they lie asleep; Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat, And in this state she gallops night by night Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees, Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two And sleeps again. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them and learns them first to bear, Making them women of good carriage: This is she--This is she!
Shit... shit... what shit?
I am husband?
Shit?
Who?
Thank you, sir.
What are you doing? This is an ecclesiastical court -- you have no right to do this!
Now this jury is gonna be lookin' at the evidence with one eye. And at you with the oth...
Listen, Snoopy, I'm on my way up to Detroit and need a place to crash.
Thank you. Let go, there's a good nurse.
Sign says "Shut the fuck up." Or can't you guys read?
Studs. Hey, son, you must be one a them psychic friends. I was just thinkin' about you.
Snoopy. Glenn Michaels.
No! No -- we're just on our way downstairs!
Lynette, I told you already, it won't work.
You weren't always so carefully neutral. We have a complete dossier on you.
I haven't the slightest idea.
Well, there are certain sections of New York, Major, that I wouldn't advise you to try to invade.
Aha. Who do you think will win the war?
Ho, diplomatist!
How about New York?
Nah. I've tried. My writing's too technical, I think. Problem of being a journalist too long is you stop giving yourself permission to invent. I better just stick to making pictures.
That's a tautology lad. If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally. That's understood.
It's a wonderful thing to have so many devoted friends.
Not this gun!
There will never be a need.
Not now he doesn't. This is my place.
BETTY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU... IN PERSON! WHERE'RE YOU AT?
GODAMMIT, BETTY!... WHO'S CHLOE?
Hi.
My own.
No no...
--so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of Hana on the island of Maui...
Look, I just thought if you finally got rid of this obsession with this name, if you could get it out of your system once and for all, then maybe you'd be able to stop waiting and open your heart to someone real. Granted, ideally, me. I didn't do it to hurt you. I did it for you. I did it for us...
All right.
Mr. Deeds, are you the son of Dr. Joseph and Mary Deeds?
New mouthpiece. Been waiting two weeks for this. Kids keep swiping them all the time. They use 'em for bean shooters. What can I do for you gentlemen?
How do you pay for one of those?
Yes.
Are your parents living?
Rock?
Is there enough room?
Here?
I brought the baby into the room a couple of times, she opened her eyes, yeah, yeah I think she saw Vada. It was.....
Just a second now. That's your truck. isn't it?
It's okay with me, baby. But how' you goin' to like it?
I can see why.
Some other time, George.
Got to see Pop, Uncle Billy.
There's a squall in there that's shapin' up into a storm.
It's important.
Big Ed s? Big Ed s Tires? Why...?
Where do I go now?
I'd rather not.
And so did I.
NO! What are you -- you're serious about this?
Wait there.
Now, that's a brilliant answer. Why didn't I think of it? Our conversation could have been over long ago.
Oh the papers
That's a long story, my friend. You see, I don't like sitting on newspapers. I did once and all the headlines came off on my white pants.
Oh, I wouldn't kid you . On the level, it actually happened. Nobody bought a paper that day. They followed me all over town and read the news from the seat of my pants.
It's okay with me. I'm not arguing.
Look here, partner. You may not like my nose. But I do. It's a good nose. The only one I've got. I always keep it out in the open where anybody can take a sock at it. If you decide to do it, make sure you don't miss.
But I never saw that note! I must have covered it with my hand, without realizing it, that's the only explanation...
Yeah, and you don't drink any less, right?
Nineteen months I been sober.
Is that right? Well good for you, Sull, I'm proud of you.
You don't mind?
As I said, it is beyond our comprehension.
Stan? What's going on?
Okay, what happened right before he disappeared?
Well, where was Patrick?
Jesus. All right, what's the address.
You better go.
Well, so far it isn't funny, but wait. He says to the waiter, "Waiter! Bring me a cup of coffee." So the waiter comes back five minutes later and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no coffee."... Wait a minute... wait a minute... I'm all mixed up... A man comes in a restaurant, he sits down, he calls the waiter and he says, "Waiter! Get me a cup of coffee without cream," and five minutes later the waiter comes back and says, "I'm sorry, sir, we have no cream, can it be a glass of milk!"
The audience was a little off tonight.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. Jack?
Twenty-eight years.
So what'd you think?
You should've told us you were coming, Ma. We would've come and got you.
Sure.
I'm a very patient man.
Well to be honest, Etienne, I would rather have not known about it.
He even had me wanting to play for the "Clippers." Man, how stupid am I.
I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
-- mmm --
I want to live.
What?
You mean...and orgasm?
There a problem, Foley?
That's what everybody says.
Mmmm --
You're too old to smoke. Won't be able to shoot hoops with your grandkid.
And... uh-
How do you like this couple, Max?
Yeah, she's a ten, Max, and that's great for you because you're-you're used to twos, aren't you?
There are no twos, Max.
Yeah, you're used to the kind with the- with the shopping bags walking through Central Park with the surgical masks on muttering.
M'hm.
Where?
The one with the V.P.L.
V.P.L.?
Visible panty line. Max, she is gorgeous.
Oh sure. It's very rewarding...
Hello.
-- yes, you --
Leave her alone.
I'm so sorry.
He is sure you can do this. Of course you can not.
Oh Jesus.
Just leave her alone.
Oh Jesus. Of course I can't.
Well, we have plenty of those. Right over here. We got the MGM series, Astaire and Rogers, the Judy Garlands...
Alright, I'm coming. It's the perfect place Jahn, thanks.
Damn right it is, it's a chance to do something meaningful for a change, to leave our mark on this town. Hell, you'll probably be gone in another six months and all you'll have done is taught some kids the lines to a Led Zep' song - c'mon, don't run out on me now!
You got my word on it.
You were right Jahn, it's a great space..... Hey, Chris. Do you want to come and look?
Chris, what if I were to cut you in as partner in this project - together we could make it swing, all it needs is a good clean out and the power on, then we're in business.
You was in the Marines, huh?
All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
Father, did I act like that when I graduated from high school?
No, but come on guys, we made a pact!
Kevin, it was just a --
It was a pact. You break it and there are no excuses. You guys have to --
Oz, how about you and Heather? Now you guys are a couple or something?
Dammit, Kevin, what's with the attitude?
Attitude? Me? I think that you guys should be more enthusiastic. Shit, we've been trying to get laid forever, and tonight's the night we've been waiting for. We're in this together. Don't back out on me now!
Back out? You don't need us to get laid. You afraid or something?
Hey, I'm, you know --
Great.
Yeah, baby...
Yeah.
Fun? What's he know about fun? Why's he calling for a curveball? I wanta bring heat.
Shake off the pitch. Throw what you wanta.
Buzz? What are we doing this for?
Yeah.
Okay.
What are you talking about?
You won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the Commencement Speech at Wharton.
My wife.
Uh...
Thanks for doing this, Ellen.
You're overthinking it --
I don't think they're ordinary. I love keychains.
Pretty good? Say, I was just about ready for the major leagues when I chipped a bone in my elbow. I got it pitchin' a nineteen-inning game!
You would, huh? If I was you, baby - I wouldn't go 'round stickin' out my jugular vein.
Scared, huh?
Maybe I should wait...
You got more guts than me, baby. It's a no-good town.
I get it. Yeah, I can see your old man with a shot-gun right now.
Says you would sometimes disappear all night, then brag to me about your sexual conquests.
With a, with a stranger? With a--
You do?
I didn't want to wake you.
I'm the superintendent here at L.A. County Jail. Me and my deputies are who you'll be working with while you're here.
Same here. Let me introduce my crew. Scott...Roger...and Unruly Julie ...this is...I'm sorry. What's your title again?
That sounds great. Look, I don't want any of this to intimidate you. This is not going to be a big deal. This is going to be very easy. I need to talk with Mr. Wurlitzer. You guys get your equipment ready, power up the van and confirm a transmission code for the remote. Julie come with me.
The Rex.
Seven-thirty.
How about the "Hell Merchants"?
Mary - I - excuse me
I had them in my pocket.
Have we got a play, Anne? Oh, have we got a play! Of course most of it is Gallagher's. She did most of it. That brain of hers just snaps like that all the time.
You know I'm grateful for everything you've done for me...
Of course.
Buon' Giorno! Hana turns, startled and suspicious.
Actually, I scalped him, and then you killed him.
Del's dead, by the way. I sent him to the Great Beyond.
... see, that's what I thought at first. How can you like someone that perfect? No potential for long-range livability.
I came right from the airport.
Come upstairs. I don't care why you come. No, that's not what I mean. Loretta, I love you. Not like they told you love is and I didn't know this either. But love don't make things nice, it ruins everything, it breaks your heart, it makes things a mess. We're not here to make things perfect. Snowflakes are perfect. The stars are perfect. Not us. We are here to ruin ourselves and break our hearts and love the wrong people and die! The storybooks are bullshit. Come upstairs with me, baby! Don't try to live your life out to somebody else's idea of sweet happiness. Don't try to live on milk and cookies when what you want is meat! Red meat just like me! It's wolves run with wolves and nothing else! You're a wolf just like me! Come upstairs with me and get in my bed! Come on! Come on! Come on!
You gonna write me a check?
She's already got her doubts. I have to act like nothing's wrong.
I doubt it. But it's something to do.
You got a Tab?
Jesus, Peggy. Take it easy. I'm not used to that stuff. You always did the bills. Blame the damn post office.
I mailed it to you on Wednesday.
Come off it, Peggy. And what do you mean your house? This is my house. I paid for it, I'm still paying for it.
Because nothing else matters. That's the great thing about love. Every time we argue, every time something goes wrong, and I know that I'm not perfect either, things just work out better in the end. Cause you're my baby and I love you.
Forget it. I've been thinking. Girls must go through that stuff too. Sometimes when I look at you I feel like an animal. Maybe my dad's right. Teenagers are nuts.
Nothing.. Selling is selling.
Same to you.
A normal human being couldn't live under the same roof with her, without going nuts. She's my idea of nothing!
If you had half the brains you're supposed to have, you'd have done it yourself long ago.
Kevin, I'm telling you... it was like nothing I've...
The fuck you talking about?
I'm nervous because I have and enormous crush on you.
Yeah? I wouldn't have thought that.
-- and I'm just too nervous around you right now.
Did you send this? Is it a joke?
I'm not going to get those pearls and neither are you.
What about the money?
I've quit.
You can't.
Broke -- A Baron? But, Baron --
Perhaps this evening, Baron, we could go to the Casino -- the place we passed with the marvelous bright lights?
I'd like to Kringelein, but I can't -- I am broke!
The Baron is tired?
No, Kringelein, not tired, -- just -- Well -- well --
What're you doing down here?
I tell you, it's a screwy set-up. We better hold onto 'em both.
No. I just need some space, maybe.
I don't know, I've just been thinking, maybe we're not happy with each other.
Y'know, we've been, I don't know, sort of, unhappy with each other and --
It's not somebody else.
A private investigator... You re not Austrian?
Did I miss anything?!
Just in time.
Hello.
So that makes what would have been 4500 into 7000, doesn't it? If you sent the equity back, you had a profit of 2500.
Yeah...you a witch?
Why couldn't you just look at his feet?
There might be an opening for a manager at Salem next spring.
I quit. Hit my dinger and hung 'em up.
Why not a lying Blackfoot?
Which one are you?
Oh. Well, then he's a truthful Whitefoot, of course.
From here he proved to me the earth isn't flat. On rainy days, we'd be above the clouds.
You oughtn't to play this trick on me. Running out when I was giving you time to rest up before I asked you those questions.
Before the divorce. My father used to take me here. Fire spotting was his summer job.
Gee! Take a look, will you?
Oh, putting on the swell, eh?
Monica, after that stuff with my dad, I couldn't trust anybody, okay. I mean, I was lost. So you are forgiven. But that was five years ago. I moved on.
Gary, you're quite an animal.
We didn't have enough dough for two tickets, did we?
Isn't he incredible, gets along with everybody.
I want him with me.
At least we'll have a house to show for it.
Sounding? I need help. He's cheap labor.
The garage is plumbed. I'll put in a toilet. We'll survive.
No bank roll there, boy. Lucky I could get you signed on--they picked up that Pittsburgh jeweler--made him talk. The heat's on, Shortie--and those Atlantic breezes are going to be mighty welcome.
Oh, I'm not squawkin', but I'm not used to working and it's a bad habit to get into.
What do you think was wrong?
I have no idea.
Maybe that pentangle was for something supernatural.
I see and they were too embarrassed to talk about it, because they felt so silly.
That was weird. I guess leaving was the best idea.
I don't know. Now that we're out here and it's three degrees, I'm not so sure I wouldn't rather face a blood-thirsty mob.
Well, not quite a blood-thirsty mob.
Oh, this one you love? What about the first one, the one you fucked and then put into a rocket and blasted into space? You didn't love her?
What are you trying to do to me?
No. No. Get Carol.
I don't think it knows it's torturing us. It's just watching.
Hey, elephant girl, call her or something... just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. Do it!!!
What happened?
Bundle up, Virge. Cold out there.
This is important in comparison to, let's say, whether they should cancel third world debt?
Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
Hey. This is my business. Do I tell you your business.
All right, where is he?
Lady, I'm here to help you. This man is very dangerous. An armed criminal. He's got a gun, hasn't he?
He'll live.
Even he. Hey, you couldn't help me with an incredibly important decision, could you?
it will be all right, madam.
Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
Yes -- ?
What?!
No. Thank you. It's really beautiful.
I-I-I'm gonna buy you these books, I think, because I-I think you should read them. You know, instead of that cat book.
Yeah, 'cause I-I'm, you know, I'm, I'm obsessed with-with, uh, with death, I think. Big-
big subject with me, yeah.
I've a very pessimistic view of life. You should know this about me if we're gonna go out, you know. I-I-I feel that life is-is divided up into the horrible and the miserable.
Those are the two categories...
You always been this selfish?
No offense, but you're sister is without. I know everyone likes her and all, but ...
I looked for you back at the party, but you always seemed to be "occupied".
Then that's all you had to say.
I give up.
Would I lie to you?
It was here. At his car. I was coming back from a job and spotted you together. You seemed caught. I waved. You giggled.
Once, maybe.
I never saw you together like that again. So I figured I was imagining things.
I really like you, Mary. You know that.
Happy. Happy with a secret.
You were in red. That red sweater with the little flowers, I think. You were leaning against his car. He looked a little like a kid. Kind of goofy and wide-eyed. I'd never seen him look like that before. Happy. You looked beautiful. You looked in love.
Buggered?
Every time. But don't despair -- I think I have the solution to your problems.
Aha! I'd been getting a female vibe. Good. Speak on, dear friend.
You didn't know she had a boyfriend?
No -- did you?
Bloody hell, I can't believe it -- my whole life ruined because I don't read 'Hello' magazine.
Let's face facts. This was always a no-go situation. Anna's a goddess and you know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods.
Damn right. Looking for her right now. Who knows? You might be her.
I'm not trying to sharpshoot you, but that 'nothing lasts' stuff, that's what was the trouble with Honey's guy. He was fooling around and Honey caught him at it. One girlfriend wasn't enough for him.
What happened to you?
Lonesome?
What for?
The Germans'll be here pretty soon now, and they'll come looking for you. And don't forget there's a price on your head.
I know very little about you, just the fact that you had your teeth straightened.
No, no, no, no. We must leave.
Yeah. I haven't seen him in a while. He used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... Good boy. Hal. Lives in New York near his mom.
Yes, ma'am.
Five years. My son was born here.
She was never really happy here. She did the best she could.
Point taken.
Give her a beer.
I just want to listen.
Could you just stop moving?
What do I do? How do I spin this?
Happily married, probably.
Obeah evil. I not evil.
Yes... I don't know, I don't know her anymore. I don't know if you can be in love with one person the whole time. I was... actually I was in love with her sister first, when I was twenty-one. And one day her sister said to me she wanted to move to Paris, so I said okay, and she said no, she wanted to move to Paris with Francois, and she's still married to him. And I moved in with Lydia... but I always really liked Lydia.
I'm thinking about it.
Try twenty-five.
How long have you been married?
Isn't it enough that I can love you?
How tired you are!
No irony. You're so appealing -- so soft -- so tired. I feel like taking you in my arms and not letting anything more happen to you -- ever.
I did not know you were so beautiful... and --
I'd like to smoke a cigarette.
I'm not running out and getting that piece of shit a Coke.
Fine. Julie, why don't you make a food run? What's around here?
I could go for a Coke.
Could I get a Coke for Mickey?
So alone.
You want to split up? --
It is so your fault and... and I guess maybe when we hit the ranch... you andme better...
Goodbye, Mary.
She told me not to fight with you anymore. She said it wasn't your fault, but -- I figure different...
I don't care what she asked you.
You know what she asked me?
Hello -- hello...
If it was my own mother, I'd carry on! You know I would. For the paper!
You stay here. I'll find out everything.
If he really loves you, you won't have to tell him anything. Snap out of it! Would you rather have had the old dame dragging the whole police force in here?
Look at me, Hildy --
I don't know, I just feel it.
She seems very nice.
I might have known. As I was telling you earlier, I'm the world champion free diver.
Good girl.
Oh, be still my heart.
Tell me, Lotte, can you understand a word I'm saying?
Tomorrow. We're late for Lester.
You weren't you. You were John Malkovich.
First of all, if he kills you, he's not gonna get any more money out of you.
Dr. Lester...
With immense pleasure, my dear. Down that hall, ninth door on the left. Watch the step down. It's sunken, you know.
So?
What's this, Lamar?
Ah
You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings, And soar with them above a common bound.
Alright. I didn't see you here.
Hmm?
No, that's called not having a mind of your own. What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon? You don't want to climb Annapuma.
With the priest, you liked them scrambled. With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached. Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much.
That's right. You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs.
Supportive? You weren't being supportive. You were being scared. Just like now. You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on.
No you don't. You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem. You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say. Am I right?
Of course you did.
I don't know.
What exactly are we going to do?
You'll be alright. Go on. Big day tomorrow. Don't forget to do that sleep thing I told you about.
Got ya. Is it okay if I do the sleep thing?
Now don't start this.
I said okay?
Fun today. Like old times.
Danny, what the hell are you trying to do out there?
Yeah. Sure. It's all settled.
Good...yuppie piece of shit.
No. You're trying to beat me.
We've always tried to beat each other.
We're on.
Am I at the same angle to you and the basket as before?
What else? What kind of triangle has three sides of different lengths.
So what did we just make?
Are you?
Okay. San Diego just came in with a last-minute scenario. It's big.
I never asked for more.
You live a fabulous life, Robin.
I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
Please don't leave me.
Where are the kids?
My mother's recovered.
It's late.
No One-Seventeen, they'll fuck it up! He told me not to tell anybody, to bring Claire and come alone! He won't wait, he knows I'm two minutes away! Koontz, please!
And I wouldn't blame these good people if they were a mite resent- ful. At a tactic that insults their intelligence.
Oh yeah no I don't want to do that.
Yes, indeed, yes I am.
Yeah, but please don't do that.
Well I don't want to do something like that.
Yeah but please don't do that: everyone would be looking at me.
Well, I'm not going down there and look.
What is it?
Little presents, nothing much... I knew it, I just knew it! Look here!
You remember that story?
I did?
You still collect them?
Yes.
Actually, it's more the plunging head first into the crowd part that gets me.
I'm gonna tell you something here, and I hope it doesn't undermine my position as an authority figure. I'm a little afraid of heights.
I didn't get into this business to have "associates." And I don't want to join your Goddamned union. "Loner-- " "Loner gunman." Get it? "On my own." That's the whole point. Why don't you become a cop, or something. You can drink coffee in the morning... with friends!
It's a damn convention.
Hard to get good help these days.
With Maya.
Is what the money thing?
Is it the money thing?
Just don't give up on Maya. Cool smart chicks like that --they like persistence.
Thank you -- I've worked hard to become so.
Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was right. This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
Take the Holy Gospels in your hand and swear to tell the whole truth concerning everything you will be asked.
Doc won't quit, been up 36 hours. Clanton came in an hour ago, they Switched over to poker. Tried to Get him to bed but he just won't Let go.
Don't worry, I can get rid of this. No trace. And I'll even go fifty fifty, we're partners aren't we?
Her face was half-pushed into the pillow, and she looked back over her shoulder at me and said, 'I won't suck you. Don't ask me to suck you.'
I guess.
She just rolled over onto her stomach and stuck her ass up in the air. I slid my hand between her legs and she closed her thighs on it.
Sorta brown, blonde, I guess. But dig this, sweetie. Then she turns over, peels off them orange pants, and spreads her legs real wide and says to me...
Maybe the assailant straightened the cabin. And forgot the cup.
No.
You're kidding. A crematorium? Jesus.
So the minister says nice things, and then, what, we all troop outside and they bury him?
Sure. I'll see you on Friday.
Yes, of course.
Is Ray going?
Don't be crazy--I'm tickled to death to see you.
You will swear to tell the truth about whatever you are asked.
You must take the oath! Not even a king, would refuse to take an oath to tell the truth in a matter of faith.
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
So... begin by telling us your name -- assuming you're allowed to tell us that much?
Show us a little more cooperation first. Where were you born?
Hey what's with you? I thought you were cool. You rode my bike. You blew some pot. What's your scene Miss Majorette? You gonna marry Mr. Blue Impala and graze around with all the other sheep for the rest of your life?
What are you talking about? I won't accept this! Get out! God damit!
Want the wagon unloaded, Clay?
Just the grub box and bed rolls.
Sure as long as you don't bring that prick Josh. Thanks Lawrence.
Then again, your dad's got his own memories and he's got his own life now...I think this is a secret just between you and your mom.
What about you? What's in this for you, Eugene?
Listen, I bag this stuff anyway. It may as well pay my rent.
It's not too late to back out.
You don't know what a relief it is not to be me. Are you sure you want the job?
Every man betake him to his legs.
That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
This is great reefer.
Thanks, Stan, you've been a lot of help.
What the hell are you doing?
... she's very upset...
Make haste! We've a hard day's march ahead.
Be fair, Oona.
Do you want me to go on with this?
Naturally, I, I--Do you know I--The sudden appearance of a black spot on my back!
You--I got the classic symptoms of a brain tumor!
That's okay, that's okay, just shut the door.
Beautiful view, isn't it?
All right, then. No more interruptions. ... at noon, she met her subjects again. This time as their Queen.
I--How was I to know?! Everyone was pointing back here.
Yeah. Goodnight.
Uh..thanks.
We're here for the week. I'm shooting in Osaka for a few days.
I'm just here shooting this band, what about you?
Have you met Charlotte? My wife.
Include me out. I've had enough of the conversations.
No -- You don't want to be alone at all -- You were in despair before -- If I left you, you'd feel worse than you did before, You must not be alone -- You mustn't cry -- you must forget... Tell me that I can stay with you -- tell me.
Yes -- I do understand.
I saw you just now -- then I saw you cry -- and now I see you in the mirror -- Grusinskaya...
That is not so -- you don't want to be alone.
I'm not going -- You know I'm not going -- Let me stay here?
Yeah, well... suicidal paranoiacs say funny things sometimes.
Because it makes me feel good to see how not funny it is and how America doesn't know the first thing about funny which makes it easier not being a famous funny TV celebrity because that would just mean that I'm not really talented.
It's not funny. It's... sophomoric and mindless... and dumb.
And if we don't, they're gonna be riding high in a brand new Kenworth.
How long's this gonna take?
I'll have it in a minute.
Hold the phone!
Got you, Williams!
Go on -- shoot me!
Our asses gonna be in a sling if we get caught.
Whose fault was that?
Shit O dear, Julian. Do you mean to tell me you didn't get it on?
What do you think?
Hey, listen, Tom, I don't mean to tell you how to run your show here but these cuffs are pinching. What do you say now?
Goddamn sonofabitch! I don't want to hear anymore! Sonofabitch! Burn the damn thing! I don't want to hear it! Throw it away!
...It's cold outside, Paulie.
Outta my house I want ya!!
Okay.
Lots of carrot juice, little lady. That, and a deal with the Devil.
But 'tis no wit to go.
I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
Oh. Oh!
What about your knocking off for lunch?
Not hungry. I want to get through this work in a hurry, and then I want to go home. What price did you get on those trucks?
Where is your farm?
South Dakota - north?
Sera, I love that name... S.E.R.A. Before we proceed onwards, there is something I need to say. OK?
Come on, come on. What are you trying to do, kid? Keel over? You haven't been out of this house in two weeks.
Well, maybe I will have a sandwich. Do you mind waiting a few minutes?
Sorry.
No one's gonna be looking at my hair. Come on, we're on.
You look like you just crawled out of bed.
What's wrong with it?
Christ, will you look at your hair?
Thank you, Major.
You know, my brother and I have been playing together, gosh, I don't know. How long has it been, Jack?
I do?
Actually, yes.
Good day, Major.
Yes I have, and do I look like a happy man? Was all that drama with Brenda a happy thing for me to do? Huh? Was it? Is she a part of my life now?
I'm very sorry, ma'am. I can't imagine -- he was certainly given no instructions.
There is only one bed.
You're really into God, right?
Very nice.
Lovely.
Charming.
Well, who? Come on, you know everybody.
You guys wanna hear a joke I heard?
I'm coming home right now, Ma. I'll be home in about two minutes. Tell Thomas stick around, I wanna see him about something.
Well, I guess I will tonight.
Just some sketches.
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
Thanks, comrade.
Don't mind about me. But could you do me a favor and clear her place and take away all evidence of her, and bring me a big glass of vodka?
I'm just not... you know, I don't think I could take a mellow eve- 'cause I-I don't respond well to mellow, you know what I mean, I-I have a tendency to... if I get too mellow, I-I ripen and then rot. You know, and it's-it's not good for my...
What's... you... well, what's the matter, You w-wanna go to that party?
I really enjoyed it. Nice to have metcha. Good night.
It was a wonderful set.
Maybe if you're on the Coast, we'll get together and... and we'll meet there.
Would you please go and look?
You... in the Navy?
I joined the Navy.
Like all this.
I don't know you...
How long have you been back?
And you like it.
What're you talking about --
She's okay. Everything's okay...
Yeah.
All you gotta do is get in.
No, and believe me I've tried everything! I must have telephoned her a hundred times. I've sent her telegrams, I've sent her flowers... I asked her to dinner... I offered her seats for the Opera...
That wouldn't have done any good. Not with her. She's the most incredible creature I've ever seen.
Well... er... I caught a glimpse of her when she walked through the lobby.
You can't imagine.
Timeless. When she comes into a room you'd think that the Bolsheviks had taken over Paris. She wears her cheap miserable blouse as though it were the latest model by Schiaparelli. What a woman! What a woman! There is a Russian snowstorm in each of her eyes.
No, Ilsa, I won't let you stay here. You must get to America. And believe me, somehow I will get out and join you.
Too close.
Would four of them -- ?
You can tell that from here?
You don't say! I might just take that compliment as an insult.
Then I wouldn't worry too much. But let's keep an eye on her.
STOP CALLING ME THAT! MY NAME IS NOT DAVID, AND IF YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW THE DIFFERENCE, YOU'RE MORE FUCKED UP THAN I THOUGHT YOU WERE!
On the drunk.
Who put you up to this? Did my ex- wife ask you to...?
Where did you hide it?
You were going to have this thug...?
Preacher, gimme my coat, will ya?
Perhaps you're right. I can't let you go though. Too much has happened. You're my ace in the hole.
Then you use your soup spoon.
Not on this trail, I don't. I've been over it before. Anyway, you ought to be pretty sleepy. Why don't you climb in back.
Yeah? Like what?
I mean, Cabernets can be powerful and exalting, but they seem prosaic to me for some reason. By comparison. How about you?
I don't know. Why are you into wine?
We are at least four acts short, Will, if you are looking for disaster.
I couldn't say, which one?
Why are you in New Orleans? If you don't mind my askin'.
Actually, some of the richest people I know have the worst manners. Of course, Mr. Harris, being of old money, knows his way around a table. All right now, pay attention please. Salad fork.
White Boy, the man's not gonna hide no diamonds under the fuckin' mattress.
Eleven.
'Very well, captain -- I'll pass that on straightaway.'
You know those horsey biscuit gravy packets? I move all of those--
I sell biscuits to the Southland.
I sell biscuits and gravy all over the Southland--
It's what I do.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
You implied it.
About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
I never told her.
I don't know. Just one of those.
What do you mean?
Because they are all the same.
I, uh, I have some problems.
We're going to need it all.
Just aiding and abetting if it makes you feel better.
No, for the Asylum.
Perfect!
They'll never get us.
That dreamers often lie.
In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
Good.
Peace, good Mercutio, peace! Thou talk'st of nothing.
Absolutely...You go have a good time... You have some place to go?
Which means I'm at their mercy and who wants that?...I'm not going to tell you where this thought led me... Anyway, well, why not tell you? -- it's a happy thing. In the middle of all this I start to think about something that does nothing but make me feel good and makes immediate sense and that's you ...And I'll stop here but, Jane, I'd give anything if you were two people so I could call up the one who's my friend and tell her about the one I'm in I...I don't think I should go any further. Come on -- I'll walk you to the corner.
True, I talk of dreams, Which are the children of an idle brain, Begot of nothing but vain fantasy, Which is as thin of substance as the air And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes Even now the frozen bosom of the north, And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence, Turning his face to the dew- dropping south.
This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves; Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
I don't want to see you at all!
The power move is to go unannounced. Black suit, right?
"Dad says we gwan sleep on it.
Seventy-two clients. ONE stayed. Jacket on, tie in pocket. 44.
I think I was trying to sleep with you at the time.
That's right.
If you rest the baby on your shoulder, she'll stop crying.
We just can.
Boy, that sauna is really... can't you turn it down or something?
Why not?
Why not?
And?
How about tomorrow? I don't mean to be pushy but --
Well -- look -- don't be confused. We're getting married.
You mean you're confused?
Frank. I'm here. I always get here. Don't sweat it.
Tell me about Catherine.
What did she tell me, Beth?
Wait. What do you mean?
Well, I believe you have to fill out a form. There's a pad right around here.
Well, that's not the way it works, really. And you ate most of your food already, too...
I can't do that. But if you wait a minute...
I'm sorry, sir. Just let me find the forms here.
I'm Chairman?
DO YOU WANNA DIE?!
I forgot where I put my keys.
Watching television in color.
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Thank-Q!
I think it's the eyes.
Why doesn't it never work out?
Thank you.
What do I need for that?
Yeah?
Something wrong?
Well, even without anesthesia I always tell my patients to...eh... to relax.
It's a .45.
This is our last chance to play "what if". I want to do it. I'm just scared of getting caught.
Yeah, let's just get outta here.
There isn't a girl in school that can hold a candle to you..
Yes, I did, very much for a long time, and even now, I get a little sad when I think of a pretty flower or a sunset that your mother would have liked.
Ahh, that little Chevy was your mothers favorite car.
I forgot about that picture, where did you find it?
Uh huh. You know what your mother did when she found out she was gonna have you? She came home and painted this whole room pink. She was so sure she was gonna have a little girl.
She was pretty, and kind, she had your eyes. Oh boy did she love to laugh. Sometimes when you laugh, you sound just like her.
It is kind of rough.
Yeah, I do. Especially from that angle.
And General Savitzky.
Mattoon, Illinois. But I moved down south to work in the Civil Rights movement.
Yes, Swana.
Not at all. Your Highness, may I present Madame Yakushova?
I'm afraid you're lying, Mimi. You see, I really did see Wynant last night.
Kindred spirits.
All we were going to do is eat and wash the dishes --
Not you -- Miss Kubelik.
Oh, I'm fine, Doc.
How's the patient?
Oh, this is Mr. Matuschka -- he's Miss Kubelik's -- he's got a cab downstairs --
What do you expect me to do about it?
Try to think of nothing, Dorothy.
But how can you say that?
You get a VCR with the membership. ... For a short time until you get your own. Listen, why don't you come down to the store and you can check it out. See if you're interested.
Do you . . . ah . . . want to step outside?
Have a drink.
You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh?
The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd...
...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or...
...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth?
Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth?
No. What you usually say, I guess.
I don't know. Forty-eight, I guess.
Warn him?
Alex, has David persisted in his werewolf fantasies?
You ready, Donut?
I wish you wouldn't.
Is it all right?
It is all right.
I don't know. Perhaps he met somebody.
One wallet containing four thousand francs -- one agenda -- -- his last notation was made yesterday -- Thursday -- "Five p.m. -- Jardin des Champs- Elys es" Why there?
Wagons, hooaaa!
A letter? May I see it?
Obviously. One ticket of passage to South America -- one letter, stamped but unsealed, addressed to you --
Thanks for taking over.
That's what they call a family problem.
Mrs. -- Thorwald's -- clothes. -- Clean -- carefully packed -- not too stylish -- but presentable.
I think he wanted you to tip him.
Redneck heaven.
Hi. I saw you before.
And listen--watch out about the pals you choose--Know what I mean? Don't let them choose you--
So long, young fella. Knock 'em dead, like your old man used to!
Sure-- You know something? I have a feeling we're going to stay here.
'Bye, Mom.
My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
I know he is. You change those clothes and then come to my cabin. I'll expect you around twelve o'clock.
Gee, I wonder why.
Right.
A baby is a new person?
Do you have a baby?
Why?
Why?
But I must go here.
Shouldn t we grab some dinner first? Maybe a bottle of wine...?
No, I m serious...you re really stunning...
How are you doing?
No, I'm saying to be --
Okay.
...How about I sell you two rounds for a hundred grand a piece?
Good. For a second there I thought we were in trouble.
No...
Did you see Blank in there?
Don't listen to him, he's a professional.
I know what I do isn't moral, per se, but if you could just look past that, you'd see a man worth loving.
It's okay. It's Martin The door begins to open revealing Debi and Newberry.
The question is more about the defendant's attitu...
I don't understand the allure of dehydrated food. Is this something I should be hip to?
Funny.
She okay?
Was that your sister?
No matter, my son, he believes in you.
Yeah. It didn't make any sense.
I don't know where that is.
Hey! You know goddamn well what happened so let's not play any games, okay?
Paula, he DORed and nobody's seen him.
I'm looking for Sid.
Hi, babe. Come on. I've got a couple of things I want to tell you.
Huh... I m sure there d be lots of takers.
I m overcome by your public-spiritedness.
Jane?
Indescribable -- you knew just when to feed me the next thing, just a split second before I needed it. There was a rhythm we got into, like great sex.
You're an amazing woman. What a feeling having you inside my head.
You have to celebrate with me, don't you? Everybody's going to that bar on the corner, 'Caps.'
That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams.
One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges. It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it? Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys.
Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
It's disgraceful!
Then you use the wrong lipstick--
And you made any attempt to handle your own business affairs, I would give you a good spanking--in a business way, of course.
Everything! ... Madame Colet, if I were your father-- which, fortunately, I am not--
The same thing.
It's better than shovelling horse shit.
Prince Leopold? Is he the one who bleeds all day? So what does his valet do? Wash his poultices for him?
She's hardly a full hamper herself.
If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones.
Three years, John. Is that not a bit long to be grieving?
Come on, man. There's love and there's ...
She loved him.
You know what I mean.
What?
In Paris we have an expression for people like you: Encul d'Americain.
Yeah? In New York we got an expression too. Goes like this...
No?
Likewise.
A most courteous exposition.
But you don't have any kids!!!
'I choose my friends for their looks, and my enemies for their brains...' You're too smart to be my friend. Besides, as I always tell my kids, be careful to pick the right friends!
All right, all right! When I've got kids that's what I'm telling them!
Daddy's not coming back...He's dead.
Thou hast most kindly hit it.
I heard something.
Meaning, to court'sy.
True enough.
No, I don't wanna.
Is that your Dad?
Hey, where does it say that?
Who's that with your Dad?
Hi, Bert.
Hey, Ernie!
You don't mind working once in a while to justify this lofty position?
Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm not really thinkin' about it. Anyway, don't want those white guys laughin' up their sleeve at me when they see me pull out.
I'm telling you, baby, maybe we better get out of here.
Pay is so damn low. I don't want my kids to grow up like Barney's.
Go ahead. We'll be right down.
Hell, baby - I met this beautiful chick and she's just dyin' for me, okay?
What, you think I'm made of money?
Some seaman's loast report. Stuffed in a cabinet, good as lost forever. No one knows.
Forget Tonya Randall.
No, no, please!
I'll give you a hundred and a by- line.
The movies are a good second date, you know, as a date?
Heartbreaking! How would you like to work for me?
Of course! Roy Bensinger, the poet. Of course you wouldn't know! You probably never heard of Shakespeare, either! Put Mr. Bensinger right on the staff. How much are you getting on the Tribune, Roy?
Duffy! I'm sending Bensinger over to see you. Mervyn, isn't it?
Well, I didn't want to assume.
Why what?
No, I didn't know if you were talking to me, so...
I'm sorry.
Yes, well, they are.
That'd be me, sir. Frank Baker. This is my brother Jack.
They are in tune. But not with each other.
Is something the matter?
How'd you get this number?
That's incredible! Nobody told me! I swear! It's kismet. Maxine! It's a beautiful name. There's a psychic connection. Don't you see? It was meant to be! Maxine! Maxine! Maxine! I will shout it from the rooftops!
Oh, Maxine, nobody told me. Maxine, Maxine. It just came out of me like a song, Maxine. A beautiful crazy, song, Maxine. Maxine. Maxine!
Great. Buuuhhppaahhhhnnn. . . . . Muhhhahhhhh. . . . . ahhhnnnaaa. . nollltuuukkkaaaaralllll. . . tashabararassssssuuuuusaaaaaaa. . . nnnnnnnaaaaaannnnnnnnncccccceeeeeee Mwaaaaaa. . . . .Mahhhhhkkkkk. . . sssseeeeeen. Maxine?
I'm right?
Maxine.
Imagine a room full of women. Nubile, blonde, wet with desire, Schwartz. A harem, if you will. Me in leather. A harness, if you like. I am the object of this desire, and all eyes are on me as I speak. Ladies, I begin. I am the love god, Eros. I intoxicate you. My spunk is to you manna from heaven...
I'd say... who the hell is Ron Johnson?
It's definitely your mama.
Yes. This kid, he's earned a trillion dollars.
Okay.
Jack, for crying out loud. Your bachelorhood's showing. Ah, here we go.
How about these?
Nine?
See anything?
Big feet.
Would you think of me?
All right, but make it quick. Shoes! What size do you wear?
You wanna take the chance, Casper?
He doesn't like it. He's a boy, That's why.
No, you don't!
That'll be thirty-eight cents.
Fill her up?
He looks me in the eye like some fuckin' gold fish, and says: "I'm going to beat you".
They're just lonely is all. Hell, I howl myself sometimes.
Ah, damn -- the fucking jerks -- My, God. They want to fire me.
All I know is that they've got to fire a large number of people... and they're not going by seniority. There's a recklessness in the air. They...
Hey, what I did for you is working out?
He jumped into the ocean.
Okay... so I'll see you tomorrow. Let's not drag this out. We don't enjoy another that much.
He wants me to take his car and his client to Baltimore.
Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The 250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
But I'll get my normal fee, right?
Justice, yes. Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints.
"Paid vindication" That's what I call justice.
Oh yeah! I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car.
It's on the table by the phone. I didn't know what to tell him... ... Whether or not we were... ... if we still we're thinking of redoing the couch.
... And uh... Mario called about moving the wisteria?
You ever actually been in there, Miles?
How about this one? We didn't hit this one.
Are they too sporty?
I don't have to.
No.
Here, have a Popeye's. This drumstick ain't for beatin' it's for eatin'.
Yeah, bring it on!
Me too.
No -- why should I?
You don't want them? They're going to make a big comeback any minute. Mark my words, these lamps are going to...
Just until the Deutsche Mark turns...
But, Lily--
Oh.
I can't say.
You mean you don't know or like -- you can't say.
I can't say.
So, how long have they been like that - - you know, him and the First Lady?
Of course.
You got a gun?
What happened to you?
You re right. Why am I so competitive!? Compensation, I guess. Look, just focus, Jack. You can still pick up the spare...
Hey, I m doing the best I can... I d like to see you hit a squash ball after seventeen beers...
You're shaking. Are you nervous?
Because you young Americans think the world began when you were born. You fall apart when you don't get your own way.
How would you look at it?
Do you mind?
Of course I can. I have a note from mother.
You came through, Nicky.
I came through for you, Mom and the butterflies, Dad.
You're back in Hell now, kid. There's no butterflies here. If you want butterflies, you need to be on Earth.
What about you and Grandpa and everyone in Hell?
Nicky, I let my butterflies die once upon a time and it's never stopped hurting. That's right, you heard me, Holly. I'm still in love with you.
Listen, I got down low. Your mom's got up high. You take care of the middle.
I will, Dad. But in the words of Motley Crue, this will always be my... home sweet home...
Really...
Krinkle, you're lookin' at the two future cops of the month. We have it, and if I say we, I don't mean me and him, I'm referring to the whole department. Haven't had a decent bust this whole month. Well, we mighta come in like a lamb, but we're goin' out like a lion -
What was that about?
O.K. Sweetie, hand me the mayonnaise out of the fridge.
Yeah, it's fun for them, but it's heaven for me. Those goofy bastards are just about the best thing I have in this crazy old world. Ooh, hey, I gotta run.
Well it's more of an enclosure really.
That's what I said, so I went out and got him a leash you know, one of those clothesline runners for the backyard. He's got plenty of room out there to dig. The kid's really blossomed. Now I can take him to ball games, movies -- you know, happy stuff.
The hell with that. No one's gonna tell me who I can and can't work with.
-- There's this one kid, we call him Mongo on account of he's a mongoloid. He got out of his cage once and --
Oh she's fine...ahh...umm the doctor just...ehh...told her to stay in bed and get a little rest and...'n stay quiet...just...just to make sure that...
Ask him if he needs a good tuba player.
Tell me one thing.
Yeah, we get one of these guys every damn class. "Maverick!"
Man, you guys gooned it. Your laser butts are scattered across KANSAS.
Oh, I wouldn't tell them anything, Bill. You'll ruin the good start we had last night. I felt as if I were being treated like a person. 'Joe' this and 'Joe' that - a nice smile - Quince passed me the rolls -- no 'rapture' or 'passion' or any of those mighty things you seem so intent on imparting, but I am cer- tain, should you - uh - say - uh - who I am - our adventure would end abruptly.
Not a peep. Buddy run the man out of town.
Well then - yes. Of course.
Please, don't waste your time on pleasantries -
I don't know. For this thing to blow over, it could take days.
No. Think of another topic. Tell me what you did today.
Yes. But you might try and spice it up with a little originality.
Cassius, didn't I tell you to stay out of your brother's mind?
Nothing, Dad. Just re-arranging the furniture.
What one.
And Gaston, I was happier all day long. I felt I'd contributed something.
I'll second that.
In a minute, look it's hot, sweetie you'll burn your nose, look out.
How exactly did you hear?
I don't know about that I don't have any money I don't have any attorneys Gus is my only real friend.
You don't but it, do you? She knew nobody would but it. She knew I'd say she did it. And she knew nobody would buy it.
I like you.
A violation?
She may be a girl -- but she's no friend of mine.
No.
Might as well go to mine -- everybody else does.
Not particularly.
Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up. Broke mine, too. But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. C'mon, I'll show you where we live.
Didn't you have any help?
Well, yes, that she was. She certainly made this place a home.
Mother. She's beautiful.
That's Lily. Your mother, rest her soul.
With your hands or your tongue?
...Who'd ya fight?
Yeah --
Did ya win?
You think everybody I fight is a bum.
Ain't they?
Spider Rice.
Gallagher?
Sure - my pal on the paper. She's subbing for the society editor tonight.
Gallagher, this is Mrs. Smith.
Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
But you're -- divorced?
Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
Hi, I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you from anything important, am I?
Well, I was just messing around over there, thought I'd come over and say hello to you. I'll try anything once. What's your name? I said mine.
What do you mean?
Listen, Holly, you want to take a walk with me?
There's something I ought to tell you.
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.
Soap?
Must've been a cheap date.
Indeed I did. But, our relationship. It's progressed a lot. It's time for us to...express ourselves in new ways.
You're not doing the extra credit problems.
We've come a long way since Homecoming.
We don't get a gig.
What're you talking about?
I'll tell the cast ahead of time. What do you say?
I don't know. Just a minute...
And you resented that he cared for her in a way he once cared for you?
You resented the fact that she told you what to do in Mr. Marsh's house?
In his previous will Mr. Marsh left you two hundred and fifty thousand dollars -- then he cut you out. Why do you think he did that?
She's even taken a job as a nurse! David Ravell's getting boring, Lyla.
Well, I see it still smells like pine needles in here.
No, I don't want to be rude.
Can I have an evil twin?
Ask him.
Just move on. No one here killed him.
How come you're pretending to do cop work -- 'cause I don't think you could find your ass if you were spotted the hole.
But if you could, you would?
Will you do something for me?
There were just too many of 'em.
You know of course, we ain't ever gonna make it.
Yeah, well, that's why this machine is dynamite.
Great, but nobody laughs at it 'cause your jokes aren't funny.
We do the show live in front of an audience.
Look, uh...
Give me a tremendous laugh here, Charlie.
I played that game, Bert. In my head I played it a thousand times.
Here, I got it.
No, no. When you play for me, I pick up all the tabs.
You know where he is.
You're the first one he'll contact.
Clarence?
Buttholus extremus. But hey, you're making progress.
The hell is that? What kind of 'guy just picks up a girl and carries her away while you're talking to her?
No, I ' m not.
Extremely unfortunate maneuver.
So yeah, I've got the Sears catalog thing going -- and the tube sock gig " that's gonna be huge. And then I'm up for an ad for Queen Harry next week.
Oh, crabby guy, huh?
Can't. I'm feeling too good.
With all of it?
I would advise you not to interfere.
Put that phone down!
Who are you?!
I'm saved. Let's party!
God, it's wonderful to see you. Where's Greg?
Oh, boy! What a yarn! What a yarn! Get me Hank on the phone. Gotta hold up the morning edition.
Hello.
Going where?
Maybe he's hungry.
Yeah, baby.
I'm sorry.
Cliff, I must warn you. I know how to defend myself.
You think you're kidding.
Did she talk about him to you?
I think she's trying that.
Or building blocks for a world that never formed.
I'm going to talk to you about whether you want to get married or not. To me.
I mean it.
I'm going to talk to you.
I'll join you later.
Oh, well thanks a fucking bunch.
But there are thousands of them, made of floating ice --
Ever heard of the Sullivan Act?
He's going to have you the rest of his life, Hildy. Can't you give me another hour?
In the Shoreland Hotel. And our only chaperon was the poor old lady's stomach.
Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.
Bruce is making the nine o'clock train. I told him you'd be on it -- unless you want to write this story yourself.
Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a later train and still be in Albany tomorrow morning.
So have I--I can get it right out of my trunk.
Look, I'm genuinely sorry...
That's how I ruined my stomach.
I'm surprised he bothered with it.
I thought he busted you a couple times.
I got a bad stomach. It helps me digest.
Your father never bothered me about it. Leastways not till the drug people got on his back in the late '60s.
It was for personal consumption.
You're going to smoke an acre and a half of marijuana?
He was afraid I was going to poison somebody. Your father tried to do good for people--
Open up or I'll shoot it off.
To get my guns.
Gimme! Gimme! Let me do it! What- what's he think we're gonna do, take him to the movies?
What?
What?
Hang on, get it up, go on, higher.
You okay?
You have not slept with your husband for five years?
Now. You say the driveway's on your side of the house. So I guess you don't sleep in the same room.
So you don't -- I mean I don't like to seem like I'm prying but I guess you don't sleep together or anything.
Well how long has this been going on.
Oh no. Are you kidding me?
Yes.
You know...
No--
Look at this guy.
That's not going to happen, George, unless you get us the help you promised us.
We've been back and forth on this all day and keeping in mind the panic that would occur if this got to the general public, it's been decided not to expand the search at this time.
Not necessarily bad! If they knew we were here why didn't they let us know they were coming?
We'll get those answers when you find the one you're looking for.
Then it's not an accident that they found us.
We don't think that's necessarily bad. At least it's a point of contact.
Houston found it in the extraterrestrial's suit.
They must have picked it up in space.
Don't let them do it this way, George. It's too important. We can't find this thing alone.
You have to. We're trying to contact the ship. If we do, I'll let you know immediately. Good luck.
Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
Well... here.
Uncle Louis, we have a guest!
I think I can lick it.
It's my apartment.
And you were such an apt pupil! What fun you two must have had, playing games with me! Why me? Why did he pick on me?!!
I spent two years here. This used to bring the med-cart. Demerol. Phenobarb. It's Jacob's Ladder.
And she was the one who died. Not you. The real wife. You were the copy, you were the counterfeit. Was she dead or alive when you got there?
Don't say that! I don't want to hear that word! Don't mention that while I'm in the building.
Took no chances, did he? And when you got there, he pushed her off the tower, was that it? But you were the one who screamed. Why did you scream?
Yes, madame?
Well, we'll have breakfast in the garden.
Then riding together.
Then lunch in the Bois--
David! David! I can't believe this!
Will you have dinner with me?
Oh -- no way. I can't do that to her.
You can do that?
No, shut up, Josie. Just shut up.
A little.
You see? Life can be so simple.
Twelve seventy-five from the Clarence? The son-of-a-gun made a detour!... But he got you here.
That's when one half of Paris says to the other half, "What are your plans for this evening, madame?"
A wonderful idea! Radio or records?
Gardens. All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages.
This kind of setup, you don't have any idea what the fuck you're doing -- do you?
She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste.
No.
Come over here into the light so I can kick your ass.
You're a great catcher.
Why are you a fuck? 'Cause you got talent. I got brains. But you got talent! You're God damn left arm is worth a million dollars a year. All my limbs put together are worth 7 cents a pound--and that's for science and dog meat.
You know what the difference Is between hitting .250 and hitting .300? 1 got it figured out. Twenty-five hits a year in 500 at bats is 50 points. Okay? There's 6 months in a season, that's about 25 weeks--you get one extra flare a week--just one--a gork, a ground ball with eyes, a dying quail-- just one more dying quail a week and you're in Yankee Stadium!
I'll take you back to the hotel.
Okay, I'll kick your ass there.
He died well, that should please you. No bribe attempts or blubbering. He simply said, "Please. Please, I need to live." It was the "please" that caught my memory. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 53.
Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
Thanks, guys.
Well, I don't get it.
I been in America all my life. I'm due for a change. I wanna see what TV in other countries is like. Besides, it's more dramatic. Where should we fly off to, my little turtledove?
Landon Carter. I was driving the car that --
I see. Now what happened the day Carl Heine was found? Before your arrest.
You mean, this morning. The new story, the battery story. That one is the truth? That's a question, sir.
Didn't go anywhere else? No errands, no purchases? Just straight to the boat. That's the truth.
Well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. If you left one with Carl Heine, how is that possible?
Ahhh, but I know you.
Sylvie -- I'm getting a divorce.
Laura said we could. If we helped out with the posters and stuff. And we did. And we are.
It's only been a week. Keep sending him up.
110 . That's my final offer. I'm not kidding. That's how much it means to me not to hear you play.
No. We need the gig.
You like being a hooker, Vivian?
Sorry. That was rude.
Then I'd be delighted. I hate eating alone, and it's amazing how often I end up doing just that.
Yeah, but I had enough reason to believe he did, and I told you. So you had to at least suspect him.
I'm a professor. I teach communications at N.Y.U.
To be the wife of a poor player?--can I wish that for Lady Viola, except in my dreams? And yet I would, if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.
Regent Beverly Wilshire. I bet you know it.
Nice to meet you.
No, thank you. I have my car.
Eh, could I have my pen back now, please?
Harold Chasen.
I don't think so.
The time came, you shot him. But you didn't shoot Foley or the guy with him. They're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. Okay, now you got your Sig in your hand. You say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. But when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?
You don't. Remember.
F-five. The Wilsons and their three kids. They run the place. Look, man, I ve got to get to...
Another hotel. Down the road. Martin lives there. He took your money. He s got a safe... I need a doctor...
What s the Ambassador?
Just me... Martin s gone back to the Ambassador. Look...
How many of you scumbags are here?
Downstairs... At the front... Jesus...
Where is it?
Are you?
You know what I'm saying, Joe?
Have we met?
You keep using that word -- I do not think it means what you think it means. My God! He's climbing.
You be careful. -- people in masks cannot be trusted.
I'm waiting!
A pretty day's work of it you have made, Master Roderick. Knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a-year into the family? Best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. He takes a girl without a penny -- a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.
Oh, have it your way.
Did these guys teach you to talk dirty? Huh?
No...
I told you
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore. Ads are being pulled the Governor's starting a libel suit what's more, they all know John Doe's a phoney and they insist on seeing him.
It's off. The whole thing.
She's partial to Joey, not me
Cameron -- do you like the girl?
Sure
Then, go get her
Leave it to you to use big words when you're shitfaced.
-- The train for Marseilles leaves at five o'clock. I'll pick you up at your hotel at four-thirty.
All right. At a quarter to five. Say, why don't we get married in Marseilles?
Yes, I guess it is a little too far ahead. Well, let's see. What about the engineer? Why can't he marry us on the train?
Well, why not? The captain on a ship can. It doesn't seem fair that... Hey, hey, what's wrong, kid?
Where is she? Have you seen her?
How long were you dating him?
No -- don't cry --
Don't cry.
No, I'll tell him.
Say that again.
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.
Darling, this would be wonderful! Just once... weren't you attacked by a Bolshevik?
I've got one chapter Guizot thinks is terrific. "Caviar and Blood." Swana escapes over the ice!
Too bad! Brings our price down ten thousand francs!
But I promise I will not kill you until you reach the top.
Vous tes Fran ais?
You think she was serious?
Nothing, I just hugged her back.
Is there anything you don't jerk off to?
A hot cartoon.
She's a cartoon, dude.
Yeah, Oz, but not when she's on land.
And you said...
Oh shit dude, the L-word!
Then she said -- she loves me.
C-Span?
No.
See 'em? They about had me and the whole damn car for breakfast. Broke my windshield...
Well -- he's tall -- over six feet -- rather thin -- in good physical shape, I'd say -- dark eyes -- quite handsome, really.
I've been careful, I've been waiting my chance.
Now listen to me. The others are getting suspicious of you. I was on the telephone to Amsterdam today, they think you're scared.
And what are you going to do?
Well?
You are late -- the dancer's gone to the theatre.
We conclude our transaction.
I told you I'll get the pearls tonight.
You've been waiting your chance. You're too much of a gentleman -- that's the trouble with you.
Anything at all?
Anything at all. I presume you won t want to take the boy with you when you re finished? There s a 500 fee for disposal. The boy is yours, you understand?
Oh!--So that's it. Does she know he's on board?
Serafine...
Fixing your makeup with a phone, huh? Who the fuck are you calling?
How?
Like it?
Go through with what?
Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
You what? To save me?
Your wife knows that, don't she?
You mean God said, "I need you, Jeanne?"
Back is in New York.
Okay, it's in. It's definitely in the pot!
Look! Look, one crawled behind the refrigerator. It'll turn up in our bed at night. Will you get outta here with that thing? Jesus!
Why?
I want this thing to go to court, but my lawyer's telling me to settle.
What's Mom think?
A case like this could hang around for months and I'm up for this player relations job with the "Clips." This gets out, false or not, no one'll touch me.
I can trust Rheya.
Why d'you come out with me? You slummin' or something?
Old college graduate now, huh?
Yep.
Oh, oh. Sam Wainwright! How are you? When did you get here?
No. Not particularly. How come?
Look, I gotta go. I work too, you know.
You know, baby, I can't figure you out.
You kind of have to start with Elvis Costello, but where? "Motel Matches?" "I Want You?" "I Hope You're Happy Now?" "Green Shirt?" His records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "Where Did You Sleep Last Night," sure, but by Robert Johnson or by Nirvana? Maybe a Liz Phair track. There are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. Some devil's advocate stuff. The Silver Jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... But I think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. Ah. Dylan. Bob fucking Dylan. Now Bob Dylan would --The phone rings. He pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.
I want you to say that you haven't, and I want it to be the truth.
Nothing.
But how do you know that these -- these voices aren't really just -- well, you.
What... what do you mean?
Jeanne... the king has ordered us not to ride with you anymore.
Now is the time to secure your epitaph. The benevolent Marquise, Charenton's most revered philanthropist... or Satan's Bride.
Yes!
If you're truly determined to step out of the shadow of your husband's celebrity --
That ill-gotten funds, borne of his degeneracy, might now effect his salvation.
-- words alone are insufficient.
Eh - bonsoir.
Yes--but I didn't give it to him--
....I have seven.
.....Well yes I do.... But one more thing I wanted to tell you guys about the new plungers is that we're making the handles now in a non-breakable material called.....
This is Barry.
What! What kind of pathetic line is that?
She met some friend of Aunt Millie's who works for a record company. He thinks she's got a great voice.
She's what?
She's taking singing lessons.
What "plans?" You and Mom got "plans?"
Mom and I got plans.
How about dinner tonight?
Okay, I guess.
You coming in?
We're gonna pass the street.
Clem, I'm sorry. I shouldn't have --
I don't think we're ready.
Let's talk about it later.
I don't want to talk about this here.
Clementine, do you really think you could take care of a kid?
Gee-ma-nee!
If you're trying to show me lay- down-in-front-of-the-bus loyalty, forget it.
It was gracious of you to share it with me. Good day, Mademoiselle, Monsieur.
Good day.
Thank you very much. Good day.
I just fired Bob Alexander.
I want you to stay, Mariette. You've got to stay. You can't go now!
They re not my attack dogs.
The Fidelity nonsense...
Well, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree.
We had to, Dave. The guy's a choir boy.
This is wrong, Alan!
Inside every semi-conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...
You look beautiful.
Who cares? Rose, tell him we have an arrangement.
A five hundred foot thick steel wall. But the connection between these two electrons is so --
Sure.
I don't know but that used to be a window and I think that was a door.
Just save me a little patch and I'll do it later.
No, it's welded up!....Let's take a look from the inside.
Because this is important -- so don't just be polite. I'd really like to look...what's the word I'm looking for?...
Maybe we could just sit here -- talk a little?
I just read about it in a magazine and it affected me.
I'm getting better all the time.
Don't con me, Maxine. We're over. I just let you up here to tell you that, and to tell you that I'm taking you and Schwartz to court.
Yes. How did you know it was me?
They fit right in together. And your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...
No don't sit here and feed us some shit.
But a fuckin' baggie.
Not a tiny little vial -
Look, sunshine, we found a sandwich bag of uncut cocaine -
Put it in your pants.
You're the one who wanted to drive fast.
But it's light in there now.
Quite.
Of course.
I see.
A situation?
I'm flattered you think so.
Then what's wrong? I love you Annette. It's not like you have a husband, unless your married to Jesus.
I'm a smart sonofabitch. I just hide it.
We're sorry to disturb you, we'd like to ask you some --
Ain't that cute? They got his and her Pig-assos, son.
I didn't know you knew who Picasso was, Gus.
Homicide.
Charenton? The administrator there is quite well-loved, is he not?
But you charge. I mean, you sell tickets?
We own an opera house, don't we?
It isn't? What is it conducted for?
Well, I don't know.
Not by a long shot.
Where is he?
Why are you staring at my breasts, Peter?
Well, wha...what kind of arrangement?
Sure.
I'm not just bringing anybody -- I'm bringing Miss Kubelik.
You're not going to bring anybody up to my apartment.
What do you mean, sorry?
Sorry, Mr. Sheldrake.
Now I'll have to borrow your key.
Very clever.
You know that other key to your apartment -- well, when we had that little scare about Miss Kubelik, I thought I'd better get rid of it quick -- so I threw it out the window of the commuter train.
Don't mind what?
The only thing is I'm staying at the Athletic Club -- and it's strictly stag so if you don't mind --
I see.
Where is the Austrian? Is Friedman the Austrian?
Yes. Friedman s the fuckin Austrian!
Jee... Fuck... You re fucking mad!
Who are you?
You... Fuck you!
You re not playing with little boys now, scumbag. Where is the Austrian?
Where is he?
I don t know. He s gone! He s gone. I don t fucking know where, I swear... He s gone. On holiday...
One more.
That's three.
Who's gonna win?
Always.
-- and a bowl of strawberries. Thank you.
Want to know something? I don't quite know. I hadn't planned this.
You're very right. I think the best thing we could all do is go home.
What!?
Have a good day, gentlemen.
I suppose you'd use them as collateral on new loans, wouldn't you?
Have you lost your mind?
This time I imagine you would, yes. Hmm... With all this in mind, Mr. Kross, I can't logically make a formal bid on your company, can I?
Well, it's the only way I can be satisfied. If I use my right -- tch -- over too quickly.
I don't know yet. I think we'll be safe here. Let's bring that wood in.
Nobody dies in Newport. They couldn't even kill Sunny von Bulow there. Harriman drowned, but it wasn't in Newport.
She looks tired.
His obituary was in every paper. But not one of them said he was murdered.
Maybe he'll get a little nervous, but who gives a shit?
That's right... Take one of these.
Why should it?
She's my girl... She's drivin'... That bother you?
What's she doin' here?
Campari and soda would do nicely.
Panty hose. Work better'n stockin's. Pull one of the legs down over your face and let the other leg trail behind your head. You get the pistol. Remember, soon as we get inside, you keep that bad boy up where those hicks can see it. Once they notice the Ithaca and the Smith, they'll know we ain't foolin' with 'em.
...it may step out of a bazaar... it may wait for you in a corridor... it may hide in the shadow of a minaret....
Right now it's on the balcony.
Don't call it desertion. Our little restaurant... that is our Russia... the Russia of borscht, the Russia of beef Stroganoff, blinis with sour cream...
...the Russia of piroshki... people will eat and love it.
...we have a wonderful electric sign: "Dine With Buljanof, Iranoff, and Kopalski."
There's something in Constantinople... something irresistible....
...it is in the air... it may come around the corner as you walk down the street....
We are not only serving good food, we are serving our country... we are making friends.
-- What makes you think I'd stick my neck out for Laszlo?
Because one, you've bet ten thousand francs he'd escape. Two, you have the letters of transit, now don't bother to deny it. And, well, you might do it simply because you don't like Strasser's looks. As a matter of fact, I don't like him either.
My generosity is not so large as that.
Your love.
I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
Ricky, I'd advise you not to be too interested in what happens to Laszlo. If by any chance you were to help him escape --
That bad, eh?
You still together? Going all right?
It was kind of funny.
Those look heavy. Where's Ian?
Is that the last of it?
Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
It's my house.
It's really sad.
You know something? I ve just seen so much ugliness I don t think I d mind four walls and dinner served every night at a regular time. I d hoped to have a private word with Adonis, but if that s the way you want it.
You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
Don't you think we should turn off the heat?
You're a lucky guy.
Died! Seventeen times - not counting maiming. Shot myself in the face once with a popgun and a pellet of blood.
Okay.
Well, it's a question of timing, and the right equipment, and plenty of patience... You really want to hear about this?
You okay?
You're great at taking the edge off a good time.
At work there's always this sort of film over you.
You switched the charts; you tell me.
It's okay. The guy traded bullets with some old man in a liquor store. He had it coming.
You know, you've been very nervous lately.
-- yes, you're very smart. Shut-Up.
Do you mind if I raise a little caution flag?
Oh! Are we going to have this conversation again?
I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
You didn't come here to tell me this. You have the letters of transit. You can fill in your name and hers and leave any time you please. Why are you interested in what happens to Laszlo?
What friend?
And I'm taking a friend with me. One you'll appreciate.
How many are, down there?
Thanks.
It does.
You stay out of this, look, if I had a red XK-150 with a black interior, I sure as hell wouldn't be handing out relationship advice.
Johnny does you favors, kid. You got to do a little one for him once in a while.
What d'you say, Willie? Tighten her up?
Bosen black. Flat.
Two nights.
Yamaha white. Nice.
What d'ya got?
Try the black Knable.
What do you think?
Tag 'em, Willie. The Regency downtown, Thursday-Friday. Thanks.
How I look out there, Mick?
We got a little extra detail for you. The local priest and this Doyle girl are getting up a meeting in the church. We'd like a rundown on it. You know, names and numbers of all the players. You're nominated.
Great, kid, great.
Why me, Charley? I'd feel funny going in there.
I'm not a deadbeat. I work when I need to.
Are you loco, pardner!?! We've come this far.
I do construction, which pays real good. And I make it last by living cheap.
We're all gonna die soon. I will. You will. It sure sounds like your son will.
Well, they're gonna. It's time this gearjammer rode to glory. Now, move aside; good buddy. I'm coming through.
Hey, bud. What's your problem?
But they're waiting for me. They don't even know Cledus Snow exists.
Working hard?
Cause I like kids. I like hanging out with them.
Looks like someone keeps trying to do our job for us.
Could be. The physical substance of love.
I get it.
If he does our job, he's our job.
Just that Rob seems to think it would be wiser to start a record label by putting out a record with business- crippling Nazi Youth shoplifters than with someone he knows in his bitter jealous heart is a musical visionary. That's all.
Oh, hi.
The Malcolm McClaren of Clark Street is in his executive suite. Do you have an appointment?
What?
I heard you, man. Don't give me that "what" shit. You just told them that you're gonna put out a record with them.
So? You even said they're good.
HELLO. DO YOU SEE ANYONE ELSE around here with a band, Mr. Branson? Mr. Phil Spector?
Yeah... You just want me to wave, right?
You understand what you'll be doing?
Cause you know I can do other stuff. I mean, if you wanted me to talk or...
Wave from the door... go down the stairs... get into the limo...
Carolyn!
Right.
Don't say a .
Okay, this is working.
Now.
At breakfast.
Darling, my guess is that Wynant killed Julia and Dorothy knows it. And the police'll catch him without my help.
We should charge! Doesn't anyone have a job to do?
Betty would never dress like that. She's not some trailer park slut!
Okay, thank you, goodbye... Keep in touch...
Let's get out of here. We got another long drive ahead of us. ...the fuck where I do not know, but I know it's gonna be long.
...She's got class, and poise. Lots of poise...
What shade of powder do you use?
Hurry!!!
Run faster they're after us!!
Got it!
For their meat.
You're right, let's knock it down.
If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
That's my girl.
It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
Wait a minute. How was Lloyd?
Value? ... Value?
Well, I'm independent, too.
Well, you'll take care of her. After all, if that doctor's right, I'm going to live for a long time yet. Look, Bruce, this is a debt of honor. I was a very bad husband: Hildy could have got a lot of alimony if she'd wanted to, but she wouldn't take any. She had it coming to her, but she was too independent.
Beg pardon?
No, Ma'am.
I got money.
Well... Okay. I would like you to help me find a...wife.
Wrong week. Next Wednesday I emerge from this plaster cocoon.
Gunnison -- how did you get to be such a big editor -- with such a small memory?
Yeah. I sure feel sorry for you, Gunnison. Must be rough on you thinking of me wearing this cast another whole week.
Where?
Just take it, take the money in my pockets, take it, it's fine --
I suppose not. Is there an ornithological reason for keeping them in separate cages?
The sign says strawberry finches.
Aren't these lovebirds?
All these innocent little creatures caged up like this?
Those are canaries, Miss. Doesn't this make you feel awful?
You getting serious on me now?
Well what have you got?
Do you know if it's a boy or a girl?
Thank Christ for that.
I'm pretty naive? Look at you. You have to do all this, and what have you got to show for it? Nothing.
Have you had any before?
Okay. I think that's all we need to know.
Jack.
All right. What's your name?
Let's get it over with.
Catchy. You have any previous entertainment experience, Miss Diamond?
Schwartz.
My name is Schwartz.
Mother, get a rope!
Get a rope!
Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages!
Sure. Yes. Medical, I don't know.
Give me your number. I'll call tomorrow. I'm just a little. I'm a little insane right now. But it's going to be great.
It's been a while.
Cole. Don't you know it's bad luck to see the groom before the wedding?
I want Debbie.
Tell him how you made me fall in love with you.
What's Debbie's blue book value right now?
Five thousand dollars.
No time. Gotta go. Just tell him to read the letter, the letter explains all. Tell him I love him. And tell him, as of tomorrow, all his money problems are over.
Let me speak to Clarence.
Now hang up.
I guess, you know, we play ball and we ride to school together. And if you get mad at me, I gotta give you flowers.
One hundred and twenty-seven.
Thirty-three here. Totals one-ninety. Not enough.
First offense burglary -- -- probably two-fifty. The piggy bank.
What about the rest?
George... Do you hear me, George?
What?
I just retired.
Shermin!! Shermin!!!
I must go.
What do I do now?
Do you? You still see him?
The truth shall make you free.
A charming term. Now, why him?
I'm getting dressed.
I have some very good memories there.
What kind of good memories, Max? Your mother and father fighting all the time.
Right. I was a great athlete. Tell her, Max, I was the best, I was all schoolyard.
Yeah, well, I used to lose my glasses a lot.
Oh, look, look, there's that... that's that's my old house. That's where we used to live.
Yeah, and always over the most ridiculous things.
This press we cannot control. Americans, I think.
In a building belonging to the University in the Old Town.
We know so little about each other --
But there's so much to tell you --
The files are in a sealed room and the University are under strict orders to stay away.
Yeah.
Okay if I watch you tape that interview downstairs?
You were expecting her? Huh? ...It's a nasty business waiting by yourself. In company it's better. No?...Then I'll leave.
I'm here! Take it easy! Take it easy! Sit down, sit down... Did she come?
No, nobody came.
But where'd you go, Toto?!!
Seems like she could get a date easy enough...
What's your name, boy?
That's a shame.
No, sir.
Nice voice.
Does Drew tell you everything?
How did you know?
I don't like to interfere.
You like him, don't you?
How did you slip into this program, Mayo? I didn't know the Navy was so hard up. You got an injury there, Mayo?
...This shit's not bad.
Mayo, Zack Mayo, sir!
You're smart, Ripley, you'll tell this guy to fuck off.
Oh huh
Did I have anything to say about it?
It's Scurvy's. His date got convicted. Where'd you get the dress?
In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave. A figurehead.
Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance. As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen. You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens.
Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful.
Elaine -- are you serious about this?
High school?
Did you go to college, Mrs. Crawford?
Dinner can wait.
Fetched a pretty penny, too. Don't forget, it's the Sumo culture, they pay by the pound there. Sort of like tuna.
Mary's a mail-order bride?
Hey, look on the bright side --
That's it, I'm making an oath. I'll never procrastinate about anything again. Life is too fucking short.
Well... at least now you know.
What's that, Dom? What's the bright side?
What's so funny?
I think it was better when I didn't. It was kind of inspiring to know there was someone so pure in the world.
I've got another story.
A lot of 'em choose both. There's not like a borderline between the good people and the bad people--you're not either on one side or the other--
Because I'm your father.
Why would you want to do that?
I hear things, too. People call you the Mayor of Darktown.
Right.
And people make their choice--
Over the years, this is the one place that's always been there. I loan a little money out, settle some arguments. Got a cot in the back- people get afraid to go home they can spend the night. There's not enough of us to run anything in this town- the white people are mostly out on the lake now and the Mexicans hire each other. There's the Holiness Church and there's Big O's place.
I'm a puppeteer.
I... puppeteer.
Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
And the marriage - is that a fiction?
It's the Baron's damnable work! Too cowardly to stand and fight... he used you to save himself.
They told me you were dead.
No! I won't let it happen...
What have I done?
I thought you were dead... I --
This was all for your sake, wasn't it? Having me here? Trying to get me to like you.
I would have lied to me if I thought I'd believe it.
Well, congratulations! You fucking pulled it off!
I never tried to get you to like me. I tried to get you to love me.
Is Alyssa here?
Nothing. My dad's dying. I really need to talk to Alyssa.
Not again, fellas. It kind of hurts.
What do you mean? You're one of the few people in this town I can talk to.
No, you need to hear me say it, I'll say it. It's not true.
Of course.
Buddy Deeds--
Yes. Up here on the fifteenth floor. Goodnight.
As Charlie Steinway is my witness.
A few bars!
Frank asked if she'd sit in for a song, she said yes, and we did a few bars.
You know who it was?
Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment. I wonder if you're familiar with it.
I... I need a drink of water.
Do you mind putting that gun away? My wife doesn't care, but I'm in a delicate condition.
No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week. If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you.
Our last game is this Saturday.
No shit.
...I've got this lacrosse game. It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by...
That's great. I was afraid I'd have to go to sleep.
Oh my fucking God. You're gay.
Come on, you know the words, sing along.
I'm sorry, I totally spaced. I just...I didn't realize it...
I remembered that Wynant had some shrapnel in his shin. It often bothered him. So I looked for it and I found it. Gimme.
And she left shortly after that?
Yes.
And didn't Miss Lawson come home one day and find you in bed with your male lover?
Yes.
Would it be fair to say that when she did find out it was a shock to her?
What's that for?
It would be worth the risk.
Well, I'd say who I was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.
So do you.
That's not what you were about to say.
In exchange, we ask only that you follow the rules. Now you know as well as I do... you're not to entertain visitors in your quarters.
I'm entertaining you now, aren't I?
It's not even noon --
Conversation, like certain portions of the anatomy, always runs more smoothly when it's lubricated.
We treat you well enough here, don't we Marquis? Your very own featherbed, in lieu of a straw mat. Your antique writing desk, all the way from LaCoste. Enough quills to feather an ostrich --
It's true, dear-heart, you've spoiled me pink.
I should've told you it was the blood of Christ; you'd believe that, wouldn't you?
Madame.
Yessir.
I'll be delighted.
It wouldn't hurt to put it in.
Sir?
Yes sir...
Where the hell is he?
'Many years, uh... I know that you will be wondering why I have decided to move on, ending my tenure at Hudsucker, and here on Earth. You will be thinking, Why now, when things are going so well? Granted, from the standpoint of our balance sheet and financials, sure, sure, we're doing fine. However, Sid. These things have long since ceased to give me pleasure. I look at myself now and no longer see the idealistic young man who started this company. Now I see only an empty shell whom others call a 'success.' How has this come to pass? When and why did I trade all of my hopes, dreams and aspirations, for the emptiness of power and wealth? What the heck have I done?
You sure Foley and his pal aren't coming up here, do this themself?
It's lilac, man, the color, and the style's made known by Deion and other defensive backs in the pros. I could be one of them living out here with doctors of my race and basketball players. Okay, here comes Mr. Ripley's house up on the left. Yeah. The brick wall. There's his drive, right there.
Sure, right, they see Bigfoot driving around a black guy wearing shades and a lavender fucking bandanna, no, they won't think anything of it.
Watch the road, boy. I like this Town Car. We can cruise the man's neighbourhood without getting the police or private security people on our ass.
She just had a baby that's all.
I know. But take the-miracle of the loaves and fishes, for example! I think about it a lot...How is it possible for...
Sssssh, Be quiet, pretend everything's normal. I'm Salvatore.
Like what?
You might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.
I don't want to run short.
A man I used to know.
If they're not busted now, they're gonna be. It's wide open.
No call to. That jail looked pretty solid to me. How's she feel?
You never said this Lednov's name before, that I can remember.
Oh, you can't carry a tune - you can't carry a tune - all you are good for is to sit and spoon, spoon. Oh no, I won't wear garters
I don't know where you get that idea -- the Board agreed --
That is, of course, if you don't catch Aids from all your anal intrusions.
Miss Rustokov refuses to let total strangers drive her car.
Oh. I see.
What?!
Ladies first, Troy! That was close.
My goodness gracious! This place is something!
Fats, look, I got about two hundred dollars here. You can't run out on me.
You watch me.
No. Why?
Game's over, Eddie.
Excuse me?
Do you mind? You're sort of ruining it for me.
Nothing ever stops you from talking, Charley.
I've got to cover a bet there on the way over. Anyway, it gives us a chance to talk.
River Street? I thought we was going to the Garden.
Mm hmm.
Of course, the boys know you too well to mark you down for a cheese-eater.
That's right... .
The grapevine says you picked up a subpoena.
Mm hmmm.
You know, the boys are getting rather interested in your future.
You're a fuckin' star! And you're gonna be playin' your little one-man show nightly for the next two fuckin' years for a captive audience -
We ought to start camping again, Dad.
Do you like it?
Jonah!
Okay.
Okay, tiger. Time for bed.
It's only ten o'clock.
Thank Victoria for dinner.
But there is a bright side though. If you ever have to play a part of a guy who gets fucked in the ass on a daily basis by throat-slitting niggers, you'll have so much experience to draw on -
Do what--
So what year are you going into?
Nolan... .
Hitchhikers? I don't know -- fifty... a hundred maybe -- Who keeps track?
Are you going to the reunion?
Okay. See you later.
Or a supporting actor -
Is he gonna help you with that physics stuff?
What's this?
Get out of here, you!
I mean, it's there, Reggie. If only we could see it. We're looking at it right now.
Electric razor -- comb -- steamship ticket -- fountain pen -- four passports -- toothbrush -- wallet -- key -- what about that?
But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
She'll think I betrayed her.
In time, she will.
She'll never understand it.
For once in my life, I am not the issue.
Listen, kid, I'm with ya. Ya know, I'm with ya -- Italian, we're blood. You kill this rug -- We Guinneas gotta show these Afro-Americans where it's at. Give it your best shot cause I want ya to prove to these bums on the corner that my man can't be beat by this rug... Ya got any action on the side.
No action.
I'm gonna do somethin with it.
A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen. It was remiss of me not to come earlier.
Whether I liked him or not is irrelevant. It's business. There's no emotion involved in business... if you want to survive.
Upset. No. I never get upset about business.
--but Buddy Deeds was my salvation.
Good. I mean are we dead or something?
All we ever do is come up here and throw off the clothes and leap into bed together.
Now -- do you think we could say a few words to each other first this time?
I'm not. No. But do you think we could liven it up with a few words now and then?
No... please...
What about Tommy?
You don't have to lose your temper! That's what you told me the last time too. Every time I step in to protect you. At the Elk's dance when that big Swede made a pass at you
I'm sorry I didn't take another sock at him.
Oh, so now I was drunk!
Aw, nuts! You're just like your old man! Once a plumber always a plumber! There isn't an ounce of brains in your whole family!
Unless, of course, if-if you had some time, I mean, we could get some coffee.
Oh, book? Oh, no, I... I'm killing time. I...I-I just, uh, w-want to browse, uh...
Yes, it's-it's wonderful.
At your service.
Absolutely sure There's the triple suns on her gloves!
Hey, that's... cute... Do you have a nickname, something a little... shorter?
Appipulai Leeloo Minai..
They all like this in your family, father?
She's an exception..
Twenty-eight years.
To the same woman?
I know, but...
You married, Major?
How would you describe the sounds we heard coming out of that thing's helmet?
It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
Yes.
I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.
Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...
It was a man though... right?
You got a dog?
Hey.
You could grace our hallowed halls again, if, while you're here, you make a sincere effort to be part of our little school community --
No.
Finding the real world to your liking, Mr. Carter?
Please.
Shall I give you a few ideas?
How would you do that, Mr. Carter?
I'd do that --
For pay?
Besides attending all your regular classes, I'd like you to help our janitorial staff after school --
A man like Ringo's got a great Empty hole right through the Middle of him and no matter what He does he can't ever fill it. He Can't kill enough or steal enough Or inflict enough pain to ever Fill it. And it drives him mad. Sick mad. Cold and dirty.
You tell Ringo... just tell him I'll be there.
I made a promise.
We can't wait -- the wedding's in half an hour and we must strike in the hustle and the bustle beforehand.
Tilt his head back. Open his mouth.
Has it been fifteen minutes?
Maybe their silence is a sign...? Maybe it's a sign to go home?
It was a mistake.
No. My ship was doing a map of all the suns and...
We were doing a map of the stars and all the other things up there when we saw a small ship. My... eh... we kidnapped it. On it there was a map that said how to come to Earth. This was very important. Before then, we thought we were the only people in all the stars.
Yes?
We told our home, and the people who tell us what to do on my planet said to come and look but not to talk, not to land, not to shoot. Just to look from up there. We came and... the driver of my ship...
Geller, you don't want a reporter's life. They're very--messy. You're all about order. Control. And getting me my copy by five.
Not long... A few days.
Oh.
Do you have any hot soup?
Then you have some hot tea?
Hot chocolate?
Well, a ball player.
And a gymnast!
I was going to fake it.
Oh, that.
Mr. Fennyman, let me explain about the theatre business. The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster. Believe me, to be close by the plague is a bagatelle in the ups and downs of owning a theatre.
by order of the Master of the Revels!
Nothing. Strangely enough , it all turns out well.
So what do we do?
I don't know. It's a mystery.
How?
It's....whatever....that's not cool.
Ok.
I'd send them up, but sadly, I don't trust the young lady to find you on her own.
It's what I do for a living. It's how I make money.
Barnard Thomas here. Miss Vivian, I wonder if you might come down to the front desk. There's someone here to see you.
Why'd you come here?
What do you have in your purse?
You killed him -- didn't you, Joanne?
Then you would have gotten your money?
You didn't know about it before that?
Do you care if I sit down out here?
Can I help you pack?
Lili... I love you!
No sir...
Gotta hex from a voodoo?
I'll tell ya though, it's comin' up to the time when Marietta and me might just set up house together and settle down... I think that time's comin' up right soon. But like you said, everythin's relative.
Okay.
Sure.
You okay?
I've never had a girl.
I forgot to thank you for breakfast.
I don't know. It just feels good. Always did.
Don't have kids. Other pictures--I don't know--it's nothing I want to look back on.
Pack my things, Walter. I'm going home.
Yes, sir.
You shouldn't be running away like this. What's going to happen to the Estate?
They can have the Estate.
I'm sorry.
I'm staying here with him 'til the plane gets safely away.
Because you're getting on that plane.
You think of everything, don't you?
And the names are Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.
If you don't mind, you fill in the names. That will make it even more official.
Well, who are you, then?
Now. I look up, I look down. I look up, I look down. Nothing to it.
Hello, Lieutenant. Good to see you.
I wanted to see what kind of a day it is.
Oh, God. It's starting.
Wear the belly before you go.
Does it matter?
If that's the way you want to play it.
Ms. Tramell, we'd like you to come downtown and answer some questions for us.
Okay, okay.
When you get back, I'll be gone --
Couldn't you just do a phone interview?
If she knew, she'd never forgive me. It would be hopeless for the two of you.
This is not a joke. Thank God Victoria doesn't know. It would really have hurt her feelings.
Well, this place sorta reminds me of something.
Yes.
No. But...
It's all very normal.
This is all normal. Don't worry. The abortion procedure... it affects you. It's the ether, too. It'll take a little time.
I don't have any time. There's a war !
It should taper off tomorrow, but it can come back again. You have cramps? They'll ease up, almost entirely. As long as the bleeding isn't heavy, it's normal.
Yes, sir.
Sure.
You still believe in God?
Three.
By the power vested in me, I herewith declare this elevator out of order. Shall we join the natives?
You're so right.
Don't you believe it. Later on there will be human sacrifices -- white collar workers tossed into the computing machines, and punched full of those little square holes.
I tell yuh I ain't got no bracelet--
Yes, m'sieu. M'sieu Giron!
Sorry, sugar. Go on and tell me how old Pooch done the deed.
How'd it happen, peanut? He just pull out the old toad and let it croak?
I can't hardly understand you when you talk with one of them Mores in your mouth.
Marietta, settle down now darlin'... I want what's best for her, too - like I said, I'll do what I can to bring her home.
But honey, I thought you told me your Uncle Pooch raped you when you was thirteen.
Anything I can do? I'd jump overboard if it'd help you.
Wise beyond her years, I'm sure, and such poise, too. Very, very impressive...
Say hello to New York for me.
Consciousness is enough, that's all I've saying. Consciousness should be enough for anybody.
If God is beyond our comprehension, and she -- -- is here for reasons that can't be understood, isn't God here?
Not necessarily.
You're unnerved because you've spent your whole life thinking nobody is looking over you, and suddenly your subconscious is an open book. We are, for the first time, experiencing changes in natural reality by a force not our own. That proves that --
-- we are not sure of that. We are not sure we aren't all hallucinating.
It's genetics. You know this. You know where it comes from. There is nothing wrong with uncrossing a few crossed wires.
Who are you trying to convince?
Listen, there're some major local talent inside just dying to meet you...
Will you sleep soundly tonight?
No, sir. Plainly put, I never expect to sleep again.
I'm not the first man God has asked to shed blood in His name. I will not be the last.
I told myself that was good. That it made our friendship special. And didn't mean she was ashamed of it. Necessarily.
Free his mouth.
Water?
Water.
No.
No.
May I ask how much your rooms are?
At school, she kept mostly to the Japanese kids, and sort of ignored me. As if all of our times alone together...in the hollow cedar, everywhere...were a secret.
So you're on your way to Tir Asleen, huh? I hate to tell you this, Willow, but Tir Asleen dosn't exist.
I did?
Yeah, like...
It would be nice though, if there was a place like that. You know, that no one could get to.
There's worse places, honey.
What's this?
The new Belle and Sebastian. Like it?
Well, I'll just make it for you.
Okay.
'Cause you like their second one, you said, Pop, Girls. etc. The one with Cheryl Ladd on the cover. You didn't see the cover though.
Yeah, I haven't really absorbed that one.
I'll tape it for you.
No, that's okay. Really.
I'm what? What?
Let's see how long we can stay under.
Man, you're schizoid!
Hey! How 'bout that!
Haven't you noticed your personality splitting?
I bet you hear everything I say!
Isn't he schizoid?
Not lately.
How do you know so much about this junk, Plato?
Now I can do what I want.
That's right. The world is your oyster.
That's right. You just act like one.
Yeah, were yuh? I was-I was at an Alice Cooper thing where six people were rushed to the hospital with bad vibes.
Uh, oh, I don't know. It might have been Leopold and Loeb. Hello. Oh, hi... Uh, no, what-what's the matter? What-what-what? You sound terrible... No, what- Sure I- Whatta yuh what kind of an emergency?... No, well, stay there. Stay there, I'll come over right now. I'll come over right now. Just stay there, I'll come right over.
What's- It's me, open up.
Hello, Hildy!
What do you want?
Yeah, I'm a brute. We were engaged once though, weren't we?
He knows. Don't worry, Tess. It's a man.
Tell him not to waste time calling. To get over here soon as he can. I think Thorwald's pulling out tonight.
Goodnight, Mrs Doyle.
He was just laying all his things out on one of the beds! Coats, suits, shirts, sox, even his wife's --
That alligator bag his wife had on the bedpost --
I'm through listening to you!
Reggie -- why won't you listen?
Then who did? You're the only one left.
But I didn't kill anybody.
Do you mind if I come down and see it?
And you want to know --
And he is still willing to give you a visa?
No, I... I think we should talk about this.
You want my advice?
If you're unhappy with the arrangement --
I'm not unhappy.
No... it's just...
Look, can we forget last night? We gotta talk.
Talk.
I been thinking maybe we should make some changes. I been thinking maybe we should take on a singer.
Sure, why not.
It's just an idea. I want your opinion. I mean, we go halfway on everything, right?
It's more like 40-60, wouldn't you say?
We agreed that if I took care of the business; I'd be entitled to the extra. Isn't that what we agreed?
That's what we agreed.
Elora Danan!
You know, you're not a bad-looking girl. In fact--I think you're lovely.
Mary--fall off the boat and turn to the left--
How'd she sound? Was she doin' okay?
Did she tell you where she was callin' from?
I got some news, Marietta. Lula and Sailor been here. They checked out of the Hotel Brazil on Frechman Street yesterday.
I know the feeling.
You aren't?
Just thinkin' out loud. Forget it.
What?
I asked you somethin', boy!
I just did, but they said you left. This is a pickle, George, this is a pickle.
Reducing?
You?
Oh, my large and noisy neighbor -- really? That?
Oh... poor child. If you were free, I'd ask you to come and have some tea -- but --
Oh!
All of it?
Most imposters are --
I don't believe it -- he was a real gentleman. I know people... I'm so tired I can hardly see out of my eyes. No sleep for two nights and so many duties and now this killing in the hotel -- that means a lot of work. But it's too bad about the Baron, you always felt better when he came along -- always friendly -- such an agreeable fellow.
Fine, thanks. Saw my girl, said goodbye, everything's gonna be okay. I guess I'm yours now.
No, I suppose not. How do you feel about your mother?
I don't think I'm getting through to Mother like I used to.
And were they all done for your mother's benefit?
I wouldn't say "benefit."
Fifteen.
A rough estimate.
Just give me a rough estimate.
Well, a rough estimate... I'd say fifteen.
And why is that?
Well, some worked out better than others - some had to be abandoned in the planning stages - do you include the first time? - then there's the question of maiming...
So you don't believe his condition is the result of anything supernatural?
You were in a fight--
You look good--
No, you look good. I was just wondering.
It could have been anything.
No, sir. Radar.
People have made mistakes in these situations before.
After I called in, I had a chance to sit down with the three locals. They swear there's another one that didn't make the ship... It might be alive.
Sit-and-spin. Alright... why not?
Young hearts run free. Never be caught up, caught up like Rosaline and thee. Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
No.
Really?
I... I just want you to be happy, Mary.
But you can't...
We don't want to be disturbed.
I just want a word with Monsieur Mercier.
No, you re right. What are we doing?
I love you. I just wanted to say it.
Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie. How 'bout it.
Not I, Not I believe me: you have dancing shoes With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
Jack woke up on the wrong side of the bottle.
It's okay, everybody does that.
Thank you, thank you. You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family. Right, Jack?
Right. I love you, Frank.
We'll find him.
I don't know why I feel so good. I haven't felt this good in a long time.
I expect you shortly.
I should be committed.
Oh, yes, yes.
Raise your hand...where?
Ready?
Somebody get her a mike? Can we manage that? And a spotlight. What's your name?
Yeah, well I kinda figured that.
Hello?
I suppose you know why I came ?
Holy jumping swordfish!
Never mind that. If you can't get my breakfast ready - and can't get here on time in the morning - then you can go get yourself another job.
Hello, Smith.
Don't be sorry. Just get the breakfast, that's all.
Hey, Gallagher!
How about my breakfast? How do you expect me to ring a curtain down on an empty stomach?
Uh...
Are you all right?
Oh I see, 'cause usually that doesn't require such a lengthy consultation.
Well Rose was being very thorough.
Was Rose.
Watch out for the smile, boys.
I'll be right up.
Few minutes. Want to catch the news.
Just like it. Nobody backing down. You back down, you pussy. Tell me what you and Buddy doing up here in the cold?
COME OFF RIGHT--COME OFF HIGH--I'M IN--I'LL ENGAGE.
ENGAGING BANDIT 12 O'CLOCK.
SHIT!!
Who are you, then?
Is that really what you want?
Just good luck.
I have to get up early in the morning tomorrow, so...
Sounds good. But right now I should go.
Okay.
I think so.
Why?
I saw the ad at George s. I m passing through town and I m in a hurry.
What sort have you got?
Yeah.
Second question. What did Ole Jurgensen pay you per acre?
Objection. Asking witness to speculate about deceased's state of mind.
Excuse me.
Oh, I see. Gestapo spank.
I have my orders.
And got well paid for it on both occasions.
Oh, laugh if you will, but I happen to be familiar with your record. Let me point out just two items. In 1935 you ran guns to Ethiopia. In 1936, you fought in Spain on the Loyalist side.
Maybe. Well, it seems you are determined to keep Laszlo here.
The winning side would have paid you much better.
With smoke.
We'll use smoke pots. Like the Army uses.
Can we go on living here otherwise?
And with time she will, I'm sure, become affectionate.
I wasn't finished -- the next thing you lose will be your left eye, followed by your right --
Let's get outta here. You want to?
Sure. He was trying to make us his family.
You gotta be kidding me.
What for?
Come back here, kid!
This is it. This is where I live. I suppose you could bunk over there and you could go to school at the base.
I'm not finished. I'll only be in port one week a month and when I'm here you'd never catch me playing daddy with you 'cause it's not who I am. Like I told you on the phone, you I'd be better off in that state school back in Virginia.
Great.
You got to kid. Let me spell it out for you. This is a whorehouse. And I happen to like my life the way it is and nobody's gonna make me change.
I ain't never going back to that school, sir.
I don't care about that. I just ain't going back. You don't want me? Okay. I'll find me another place.
...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. Just a shoulder to cry on deal. One thing leads to another and before I know it --
Well -- Marylin and Rex broke up and...
I had no idea until after, but --
No!
I know him. That's Creek Johnson.
Very cosmopolitan.
Oh, good, my way. Thank you, Vizzini. Which way is my way?
Fine, fine. But I was thinkin', You know what this town really Needs is a race track.
I was working... can't you just drop me a thank-you note?
Note. Put it in the note.
Too bad. The Thorwalds were just leaving the apartment house at that time.
Six ayem.
What time?
-- until yesterday morning.
Then where is she -- in the ice box?
She never left the apartment --
Not yet.
Feel a little foolish?
You sure?
Lydia?
The universe is a living creature, like you and me, Madmartigan.
...What?
Vivian. I'm paying you to be you. Be you. Have you? Ever been in love with anyone?
Easy now... That mare's in season.
You want to work at Carl's?
Arnold. What's happening?
What about him?
I don't know. Fortunately, she has a dinner engagement tonight. I'll meet you at the station--midnight. Hello ... Yes? What? ... You found a handbag? Well, you're three weeks too late!
Probably not.
Yeah. Probably not.
ys e seven, eight, nine, two. We have to clear out. Railroad station? Ticket office, please.
You'd love it!
Yes.
Positive.
Did you do everything I asked you to?
What letter?
Is that what she used to sing?
Bye bye blackbird.
I don't know.
I miss her. What do you think happens to someone after they die?
I never did. Or the whole idea of an afterlife. But I don't know any more. I have these dreams about... your mom... and we have long talks about... about you, and how you are, which she sort of knows but I tell her anyway. So what is that? It's sort of an afterlife, isn't it?
I know. But she's here, Jonah. Because I have you. And as long as I have you, I have your Mom.
I'm starting to forget her.
Oh, I'll probably end up down at the library.
What'you see in that guy--he's dim, pretty boy. a young, wild,
Because you have to find a good reason to come back up again... And I always have a hard time finding one.
And Kat was fully clothed.
Tell me, did he kill his little victims too?
The damage was considerable. But she's insured. Thanks, again.
Whenever George tells someone how steadfast I am, he always makes me sound boring.
He's still in love with you.
You knew he had nothing to do with your brother s disappearance, didn t you?
It was before you started going out. We had lunch at that inn on the lake.
Who was that man?
You two are gonna help me tame the wild beast?
You think Drew will go for it?
Is this some kind of mugging? Because...
We're your guys.
In that case, we'll need to make it a school-wide blow out.
This is it. A golden opportunity. Patrick can ask Katarina to the party.
Can you believe it? I just risked my life for a network that tests my face with focus groups.
In my jacket. Left inside pocket.
It's gonna be close. Real close.
Well, since you're a member, we could...
-- How we doing?
Talk to me.
Bandit II?
Hello, Herman, it was a happy landing, I see.
I'd better call Sylvie -- she must be frantic.
Who invited you?
No, I'm not proud of myself... But we don't have the luxury of choice.
Want me to carry Elora?
Pre-Castro.
Why?
You left her. How's that for a fact?
How's this for a fact? I loved her first.
Next time, have some good news.
Yeah? Maybe in the high rent districts they discuss -- but in my neighborhood, they still nag.
Can you see me -- rushing home to a hot apartment every night to listen to the automatic laundry, the electric dishwasher, the garbage disposal and a nagging wife.
Let's call it a night. I can't take any more.
Right. We can pick up on the rest tomorrow.
I was not.
I can't. I want to, but I have to study.
Clementine.
I just thought I'd say hi. I was in the neighborhood.
Maybe. Recognize this?
I really want to, but tonight's important. Test tomorrow.
I'll whisper some of the main parts of the story to you. But you'll be surprised how much you understand. The music conveys the story more powerfully than any words.
Oh god!
Because I can stop now if you want.
When's he due back?
I'm not leaving you alone with these assholes.
There's still time, take me up on my offer.
Not yet. Where's Mr. Ripley?
Anne, prepare yourself for the treat of your life. This is Gallagher.
Out for the evening?
You drive a hard bargain.
A lot of TV. I was a regular on a couple of series. And lately I've been doing a lot of commercials. National mostly.
If you got a problem with me taking care of your kids instead of getting some job, just say so.
So what do you think?
Just a lucky guess.
The bay doesn't.
I like well what I see. It pleases me.
You're magnificent.
On the contrary! The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting. Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
You should glory in your animal nature. It is your triumph! None know that better than I!
Not from me, surely...
Undressed like this, yes.
I went into a store, I bought a rifle. I was gonna... You know, if they told me that I had a tumor, I was going to kill myself. The only thing that mighta stopped me, might've, is my parents would be devastated. I would, I woulda had to shoot them, also, first. And then, I have an aunt and uncle, I would have... You know, it would have been a bloodbath.
A week ago, I bought a rifle.
Yes, but doesn't that ruin everything for you? That makes everything...
It's one idea...
There are lots of reason... I had a thought that if you had sex with Simon it might...
I don't know why I brought you -- that idea occurred to me is all... It came out first... Hey, you kiss him -- me... He says he loves you. You two hit it off. But you don't want to... fine... Forget what I said about sex with Simon. It was a mistake.
'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.'
Why not?
Just take my work for it.
Does this include the products of the Far Eastern provinces?
Thank you for a wonderful dinner.
Well, I think it's getting late. Good night, Ninotchka.
Bad news?
Good morning, Comrade.
I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
Did you stop to talk to anyone, Judy? Do you enjoy that?
Yeah. Great.
Is that why you were wandering around at one o'clock in the morning?
That one?
Do you think your father means that?
Well if you could tell me roughly it would help.
Shit!
Before Hemingway, there was Starsky and Hutch.
I think it's Dunn Bradstreet. But then, I could be wrong...
How was your evening?
Least you got your priorities straight.
Never had to.
It opens, too. Look inside.
Of course.
You don't have to eat the carrots. Just passed a pond with some ducks in it.
Just a road thief. Picks people up and runs off with their stuff. What a racket!
A black eye.
Come on get in.
Come on! come on!
Of course!
Why not just go to... Nome for supplies and a wife? Isn't that closer?
I've got goose-bumps all over me.
Good for you.
1959.
Well, we try. Listen, let me just ask you a few questions. When did Alaska become a state?
Russia.
Who use to own it?
1867. Seward's Folly. We paid 7.2 million dollars for it. A tidy sum then, as well as now. I'm quoting my father, of course.
When did we get it from them?
Well, we'll have to take what's here. A bird in hand is worth two in jail.
Oh, they'll come. I'll have Guild issue the invitations.
Now Mr. Smith, now please
But not for me! Though I like you well enough. You're a nice fellow. You're all right. But I'm sorry I don't need any valleys today.
Are you trying to tell me that I need someone to help me put on my pants and button them up?
Can I have something to drink?
I'll beat him the next game.
Who are they?
No what?
Why not?
Go to the prom with me
You know what I mean
Six months. Eleven days.
... The feeling of slipping without falling... The hardest is once you are at the bottom.
Wow. What... what did she look like?
The home of eternal damnation, house of Hades, H.E. double toothpicks...
My brothers told me my mother was a mountain goat. Which would explain my chronic halitosis.
My mom wasn't a goat?
An angel?
Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
'Find out who you are and do it on purpose.' Dolly Parton.
'What is a friend? A single soul dwelling in two bodies.' Aristotle.
How do you know what they're doing?
How're you doing?
You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
'Love is always patient and kind. It is never boastful or conceited -- '
Listen! We both got something out of it, all right!
I didn't know. I just said all I want is some time.
All right... I'll pack my stuff tonight.
No.
A hundred an' thirty.
Look, Bob, if ya wanna dance, ya gotta pay the band -- If ya borrow, ya gotta pay the man... Me, I ain't emotionally involved.
Kurtz was the one who got us into this mess in the first place. You people knew this ship wasn't ready to fly. You played God with over a hundred lives, Kruger, and for what -- the prestige of your precious space program.
It's wonderful. Then why don'tcha get William F. Buckley to kill the spider?
That's nice of you to offer, Karen, but I got all the help I can use right now. Instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.
Well, I think you should be realistic. Ya can't start an ad agency on fifty dollars!
What am I supposed to do now?
Mommy, this is Faith.
What do you do?
Why do you have to rush off? What's so important in San Francisco?
You have a job?
I'm trying to get you to stay for dinner. We're going to have a lot of roast left over.
Cheers.
What's that?
This is your party.
He's all right. He'd like to see you. But listen... What's the law doing to me? Do they think I did it, or is it just something else to pin on me?
I'd tell you if I knew. But I'm not in this. Ask the police.
That'd be very smart. That'd be the smartest thing I ever did. Me that a police captain's been in a hospital three weeks on account we had an argument. The boys would like to have me come in and ask questions. They'd like it right down to the end of their blackjacks. Now I come to you on the level. Studsy says you're on the level. Be on the level.
He's a likable chap--he's got an honest face--
It must be the sea air--it gets everybody.
Those kids seem to be getting along fine!--
The quest's at an end and where's the good of it? A faerie festival over a pile of bones?
I'll do anything... face any challenge!
Tis not the wound, that's sure. Not a scar remains... we're talking about a spell; harder to repair than sword-work.
I was with the Princess.
Might not need a gesture quite so grand. What were you doing the very moment the Baron's curse fell on the world?
By the pond. She was teasing me.
Where?
A lot. We got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.
A few times. It's kind of an annual tradi--
Oh yes, you are one of my favorites.
What's going on, Jerry?
I was a world-class loser and she was a happy, little rich girl -- and for some reason she took me in.
But she loves you?
Because there's nothing we don't know about each other and it's okay. I mean the deeper, darkest secrets -- they don't matter.
'The deepest, darkest secrets --'?
Who died?
Keep away the cats! Thou art like one of these fellows that, when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says, quot;God send me no need of thee. quot; and by the operation of the second cup draws him on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
I can't frisk you but the cops can.
Jesus. That thing's been in the bargain bin for six months! Was it just your criminal nature or what? Hell, I would've given it to you for free.
I'm gonna take her home first.
I did. Since when do you go about slipping notes under men's doors?
Because you ran after me.
Francesca?
Edie, listen, stay out of this mess. Quit tryin' to ask things about Joey. It ain't safe for you.
No, Acrophobia isn't a crippling thing. It just means I can't climb steep stairs or go to high places, like the bar at the Top-of-the-Mark. But -- -- there are plenty of street-level bars In this town.
We're too late.
Where are you?
I know. I taped it.
Well, when?
Not if you count 'Singing in the Rain.' Do him a favor and don't treat it like a tragedy. You want me to talk to him?
Okay, get in hot water. But don't come hollerin' to me when you get burned.
What?
I don't believe it.
Plenty of signs -- just none of them printed. Who do I get the idea you're not just passing through!
Were you thinking of personally driving me back East?
Come on, get up. That horse is carrying too much of a load.
Don't forget about production for use.
You ought to stay over. You always wrote a good hanging story, Hildy.
Hildy, how'd you like a couple of tickets for the hanging?
That's good, Earl. Oh, they've got another alienist to see you. He ought to be here any minute. Don't go to sleep, will you?
I won't.
Well, a guy can win when Hildy ain't around.
Who's this guy she's gonna marry?
Who won?
Lee...
I don't know.
No.
Agreed.
Just a guy trying to put out a fire.
You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
Shoot.
Oh, I don't mean that. I'm sure I'm going to need your help.
So you weren't interested in music at all?
But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
But don't you remember?
You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- "It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection."
Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
Rot in hell, Melvin.
No need to stop being a lady... quit worrying -- you'll be back on your knees in no time.
I sure remember Tommy. Mind if we talked about something else?
Where are all your queer party friends?
That cleaning woman doesn't...
You're a very pretty girl, Paula.
Hi, everybody. Am I late?
I'm cucumber cool.
And...
Lois, I really don't see why --
I'll just set it right here.
...This'll only take a moment.
Yeah?
I called her up.
You never used to do that!
No...It's nothing to do with you. It's just that I was scared of coming back. Now, after all these years, I thought I was strong, that I had forgotten lots of things. Instead, I find it's quite the opposite, as if I had never left. And yet, I look at Lia and feel as if I didn't know her, and you, Mamma...I abandoned you, ran away like a thief, thought only of myself, and never gave you an explanation...
Course I can't. I'll give you a lift to the first ranch.
You can stay here if you like.
I'm not running a stage line, ma'am, and I can't take a chance on losing the horses.
You'll have to drive -- except down hill.
You didn't answer my question.
Yes. Conviction. Conviction that I'm onto the truth. You're going to do the same thing to "poor bastard number four" that you did to the last three. You're going to run again. And I'm not leaving until you do.
Is that all you've got to say to me, Father?
Good luck.
Conscience... . I didn't even know I had one until I met you and Edie... this conscience stuff can drive you nuts.
Ball games! Don't break my heart! I wouldn't care if he gave you a life pass to the Polo Grounds. So you got a brother. Well, let me tell you something you got some other brothers and they're all getting the short end while your cousin Johnny gets mustard on his face at the Polo Grounds. If I was you Listen, I'm not asking you to do anything, Terry. It's your own conscience that's got to do the asking.
But it's my own brother they're askin' me to finger and Johnny Friendly. His mother and my mother was first cousins. When I was this high he took me to the ball games... .
If I spill, my life won't be worth a nickel.
A question of who rides who.
It's like carrying a monkey around on your back.
Edie. The Commission. Your subpoena. I know you got a subpoena.
It's so small.
What are you talking about? This is the new Mac. You a hacker?
I don't think so.
You don't have a computer in your cabin?
May I please be excused?
This must be very new.
Yeah.
So why didn t he?
How 'bout you talk to 'em about me? Please do me that favor.
No.
How do you get through those winters? Well, you're right. Juneau. What's the highest peak?
I always had a bet down for you. You saw some money.
Another time, okay Dorothy?
You use "Richard" again? We're back in Paris.
Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of transit? It seems that as long as I have those letters I'll never be lonely.
How did you get in?
I told you this morning you'd come around, but this is a little ahead of schedule. Well, won't you sit down?
I went through all that with your husband. It's no deal.
I'll take care of you.
Tomorrow morning.
Don't go.
Okay. We'll see you later then.
So she gets rid of the asshole and is set for life in the same day.
... Push me back in the water...
Y'know how I said that stuff on television didn't bother me?
Tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?
Yeah. I guess we did.
What's going on?
I'm sorry -- I heard the children laughing.
I don't care.
Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
Because they're still here.
Why not?
'Thoughts'? Not a one -- but I did hear a voice last night.
You know where he lives?
Sure I know where he lives. He lives in Bailey Park.
Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore. All I know is this should be Bailey Park. But where are the houses?
You could take it--
Clarence . . .
Yes, George?
Where's Mary?
Seriously, I think we should get married.
Well--I don't see what's changed. No - PDA's, no necking on the obstacle course.
No, I don't have one.
Why shouldn't we? If we c'n get it we're entitled to it.
Aye? Then she's obviously not got enough to do.
Fuck you!
Why did you break into that particular building?
Okay.
...She fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa. She says he was very gentle.
Which one of us is she flirting with?
It was the biggest I could find.
What was the real purpose behind this venture?
There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to.
Charenton has changed; it's not safe for you here.
It's like a cab isn't it?
The Doctor's a respected man, a friend of the court --
Is that a promise you can truly keep?
Oh yeah? That's good.
Who are they?
It s cute.
Try the house.
Toto, come here.
Don't look at me. I didn't marry King Westley.
Detectives!
Now listen to what I've got to say. I took up this profession when I was ten years old. In those days there weren't these modern machines. The films were silent. The projectors were run by hand, like this, with a crank. And you wound the crank all day long. It was really rough going! If you got tired and slowed down' boom! Everything would go up in flames!
Because I don't want to, Toto! This is not a job for you. It's like being a slave. You're always alone. You see the same film over and over again, because you have nothing else to do. And you start talking to Greta Garbo and Tyrone Power like a nut! You work on holidays, on Christmas, on Easter. Only on Good Friday are you free. But if they hadn't put Jesus Christ on a cross...You'd work Good Fridays too!
Yeah. Like that.
More than you need me.
I fell in his arms--Couldn't resist it.
But here you are, still a virgin -- you are virginal yet, aren't you?
You know where that sense of humor's goin' to get you one of these days--
Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
Should I be?
Where s your wallet? Have you got a wallet?
It s wet. Will this do?
Sir! They voted me most likely to succeed!
Yeah. It's a fact.
Oh, it isn't like that.
No. My mother.
Mother? But your mother --
Well, so you're getting married tomorrow, eh? How does it feel, Bruce?
Taking the train today -- and being married tomorrow?
Feels awful good. Yes, sir -- we're taking the four o'clock train to Albany and tomorrow we'll be married.
It's not mine.
Precisely. You give me the Mask security code, I steal the Mask, you get a finders fee. At ten percent, should be two or three million at least. Not too bad.
Ok.
Yeah I can't.
We? Are you implying that I'm taking you inside?
The man you love.
Oh no. Nobody said nothing to me. Only I got the idea that -- well Clay and me used to be walking through town and there was your place and through the window I could see you dancing, but Clay always took me over to the other side of the street.
Good night, Miss Wells.
Yeah.
Someday she'll thank you.
Yes?
We gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy?
Yes -- might make it hard to strike a really romantic note.
I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
I know...I know. You did the right thing.
Good-bye, Adam.
Goodbye.
Could I please just go home? I was lost, but this morning I found home and I promise not to bother any of you ever again.
Yes, ma'am.
It's not his happiness you're feeling guilty about...
I'm going to drink my coffee. Then, we're going to the police station. Where there will be lawyers, loss of job, house, humiliation, gutter press, and probably prison.
That's a relief. It's nice to know I'm a regular guy.
Well as it turns out I did.
Even so I always felt the decision to burst in and rob it very much remained with me.
What are the choices?
What?
You were hired to look for Tom, not someone.
Someone's been doing all these things.
What?
Pete, I've got a chance to buy Jane McKenna's black book.
You were hired to look for Tom.
Call-girls generally keep a book, you know, a list of their clients. Sometimes, if a girl retires, she'll even sell it worth good money. Jane McKenna had a black book; when she died it was stolen. I've been after it a long time.
I can't follow you.
I'm meeting a man tomorrow night. He wants to meet me on East-River Drive -- he wants five hundred dollars for the book. Can you get that for me Pete?
No. It's ridiculous. This has nothing to do with Tom Grunemann.
Will the Company put up five hundred dollars to get Jane McKenna's list of clients?
Impressive.
I believe you -- So what happens now?
What, Doctor?
A masculine paradise -- drink, the ladies, dancing...
This is my business.
Chasing around.
Yesterday -- yes -- that was yesterday.
Well, Mr. Kringelein, are you getting what you're looking for?
Money.
I'll try to remember that . . .
She'll do.
I want to see you, Terry.
That so.
What?
Hey, who cared about me yesterday, huh? Nobody -- I think I'm gonna train myself.
Let's get outta here, honey.
Well, it ain't exactly Emerald City...
I'm afraid she is, baby.
Don't know, but she's gonna bleed all over our car, I'll tell ya that... Hey... Hello... Girl... You gotta come with us, honey.
It don't bother me none.
Yo, Rock -- now ya'll be lookin' for people to help, right?
Am I on my feet...?
Johnny Friendly is layin' odds that you won't get up.
You hear that, Terry? Terry, did you hear that? You lost the battle but you have a chance to win the war. All you gotta do is walk.
...walk?
You got caught. It's all fun and fuckin' games till you get caught. But now we gotcha. OK, Mr. Elliot actor, you've just made the big time -
The story -- what's happenin'?
Too many smart people in one room -- it's not healthy...
Mother.
Mother. I'm going to get married.
Mother.
I'm getting married.
You ever know a fella named Eladio Cruz?
Made some money, came back here--
You lived in the States for a while?
You have the night watch? On the radio.
Is this -- what?
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson. That's really a laugh. Ha ha.
Wait a minute!
Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
I don't blame you.
If I thought I could get away with it -
Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
I only live up there and across the roof.
Sweetheart, write down your former address.
Write down Drexl's address.
So I can go over there and pick up your things.
Only silence. It's always like this.
I'll call your brother.
It's only temporary.
Are you comfortable? Do you... want to move to the bedroom?
I give up. Who are you?
You mean you and me?
Praying.
How do you know all these things she doesn't know?
I love that you re asking questions, but do you really want to get into all of this?
Yes, Swana, you did.
Yes. Very.
The war...
What??
I really think we're going overboard for just a simple school assignment.
Yeah and they forgot to ask for one who wasn't having hormone surges.
Oh, no, actually. Busy night.
Maya, how are you?
Jesus, she's jammin'. And she likes you. What else do you know about her?
Hiya.
You know it. This is my friend Jack. Jack, Maya.
You want me to shoot Sailor in the brains with a gun.
Well, she does know a lot about wine.
Wrong! It's much better to blow a hole in the back of the head... right toward the bridge of the nose... Lots and lots of irreparable damage.
Why didn't you send Johnnie Farragut?
Tragedy?
Sure, I got... I got nothing, uh, nothing till my analyst's appointment.
Y-y-yeah, just for fifteen years.
No, no, that'll be fine. I don't mind. Sure.
But what has to be different?
I told her! She doesn't feel she can do that. Something about her father not letting her go anywhere...
You're no longer an extra -
What, your virginity? Well that's over now.
That's curious. I was appealing to their intelligence.
Have you seen the bathroom? -- Hot and cold running water -- You see, I can get a bath whenever I like.
We are about to embark on a great voyage.
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day. It does no harm and authors like it.
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we go
Oh, that's right, I keep forgetting. Comes in pretty handy down here, bub.
I know a lot of nice girls.
I'm here.
She's twenty-nine, Ma.
What, Ma?
I heard you, Ma.
Huh? Oh, geez, Mr. Hudsucker, I apologize, there was an awful lot of excitement and I guess I must've mislaid --
Yes sir...
Norville.
Queen Cherlindrea?
Who??
Rose, please listen. Whatever you want to do, I can help you.
All right. How much for the week?
What kind of clothes was he wearing?
We found a high concentration of cocaine in his blood.
I don't think so. The membrane in his nasal passage didn't show any sign of long time usage.
We found a bottle of Dristan nasal spray on the nightstand. It was filled with water and cocaine. Mr. Marsh had a head cold at the time of his death. I believe he wasn't aware that he was ingesting cocaine.
Yes.
Yes -- those of Mr. Marsh and a thumb print of Miss Lawson's.
Alright.
I think it's exciting.
My captains have sworn their support.
Well, I am the head of this household--
We'll make do. I'm of the opinion that these mutants will eventually kill each other off and then--
--do as I say!
Dad!
--and we will--
I'm-- Yes. Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you?
I wish there was one I wanted.
How could I run it from say -- Pakistan?
That's good news.
Tell me -- what was Slim Hayward wearing?
Tell 'em.
Yes.
Of course we do! We've been friends for years.
Another Martini --
...which is a long, dull story and I won't get into it. But--
One of these days.
Now listen, if you know who the pistols are, if you see them on the dock every day, are you going to keep still until they cut you down one by one? Are you? Are you? How about you, Nolan?
D 'n D?
Why don't ya tell 'im you're a fan!
...The guy's great.
Couple of bucks.
You're a pretty good player.
Yeah, I guess it is, boy. Just you and me.
Yeah, right.
Well why don't you look her up?
I did try calling her. A few years ago. She wasn't listed.
What if you're wrong? You just said she's the only girl you ever loved, what have you got to lose by calling her?
Why not?
Yeah--
So here's my idea. We do a giveaway at the zoo benefit. We get a big pi ata. We fill it with Monkeybone dolls - hundreds of 'em.
I've had enough good news for today
And the third one?
You couldn't come up with something a little more discreet?
Okay, okay. Relax, Miles, Jesus. No Merlot. Did you bring your Xanax?
...well, then you ain't got much.
She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
What?
Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it! Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
And if they want to drink Merlot, we're drinking Merlot.
The disc is still in there.
No.
Thanks
Vada!! Vada runs and jumps into Phil's arms Look at you, oh hi, hi, hi!! How are you? You look great, how's Shelly? Your dad?
I hope so. Wouldn't you know they'd call me on a day like this -- with my cold and everything -- How do I look?
Baxter?
Mmmm.
Oh . . .
You know, April, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. I get the feeling you tune in to your environment.
A drink? Of course.
Very well. Thank you.
Of course.
Oh. Hello. Hello.
Personally, I think it's God. At least, it fits my definition.
And professionally?
Yes.
I told you, try to stay calm. You're supposed to be the psychologist of the bunch.
What was it?
Was her breakfast conversation that bad?
Shut up.
I'm her husband.
Yeah.
I can't do that, Ralph, because somebody already brushed her off once tonight.
Enjoy.
I'm on ninety pounds a year plus seventy pounds for a pile of tartan I'd be wearing anyway. That's as much as a Page of the Back Stairs gets and that job's only for toffs. I'm Her Majesty's Highland Servant! Indoors and Out. There's no stopping me now.
Morning.
We've been over this. Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate.
I won't.
Ann ... Ann!
If there is anything else, don't hesitate --
Mirrors.
Nurse Hobbs said there's a disturbance in Leicester Square involving some sort of mad dog.
I have to talk to someone, Mom. I have to talk to you both. And Dad this time you got to give me an answer.
Hey...you flipped--or something? You better take off...
If you want to come we could talk and then in the morning we could have breakfast like my dad used to-- Gee...if you could only have been my father...we could...
Yeah.
O.K. G'night. I got to pick up my scooter. See you tomorrow.
I am. I only work when I have to. Two years ago I got a notion and went to China. There was a war going on. Swell! After a while it got stale. I went down to Tahiti. Just lay on the beach for six months. What could be sweeter?
C'mon, it's true -- But that don't bother me -- I just wanna prove somethin' -- I ain't no bum... It don't matter if I lose... Don't matter if he opens my head... The only thing I wanna do is go the distance -- That's all. Nobody's ever gone fifteen rounds with Creed. If I go them fifteen rounds, an' that bell rings an' I'm still standin', I'm gonna know then I weren't just another bum from the neighborhood...
All right. Meet me at the Juicy-Juice Juice Bar after work today and I'll spill my goddamn guts for you.
I'll bet a couple of hundred.
Dr. Lester, while I am flattered that you share your feelings with me, I believe perhaps the workplace is not the most suitable environment for this type of discussion.
Take care of him?
What do you want me to do about it?
Have it your way... But you want it.
Oh yeah - sure... okay.
I knew you'd want it again...
I thank you very much for the invitation, but I'm quite busy today. Perhaps I could see you tomorrow.
How about this, if I can guess your first name within three tries, you have to come out for a drink with me tonight.
My name is Barry Egan and I spoke to you....you called me, you remember?
That's not true. That's not true at all. You said that your name was Georgia and you said our conversation was confidential and I trusted you and you kept calling and asking me for money, c'mon now I want to talk to your owner, your supervisor, whoever runs this, you understand. Please connect me now.
...I can't beat him.
You know, I saw it on the stands, my first inclination was to buy it. But, I look at the price and say forget it, it's just gonna be the same old shit. I ended up breaking down and buying it a few days later. Man, I was ever wrong.
It ain't so bad, 'cause I was a nothin' before --
I haven't been to the movies in AGES.
...I dunno.
Simple as that, eh?
You do know where it is?
Can you show us the way?
There'll be spoils aplenty if you guide us there. Once we breach the walls, help yourself to all you can carry.
An hour?
No. No -- I'm just -- I'm just a little worried about my future. I'm a little upset about my future.
Oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? You're going soft in your old age, Rob. There was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. Now all of a sudden I'm offending your golf buddy. You're right, Rob. I am so sorry. How are we ever going to make enough money to get you and Laura into the country club?
It wasn't even his terrible taste. It was his daughter's.
He offended me with his terrible taste.
What did he ever do to you?
Bullshit. The guy was going to buy one record -- which we didn't even have -- and leave and never come back again anyway. Why not have a little fun? Big fucking deal.
Yeah. I'm sorry... Look Dick, Laura and I broke up. She's gone. And if we ever see Barry again maybe you can tell him that.
Are you all right?
Oh, I would love to hear it.
What are you talking about?
Well -- as I see it we've got two choices. We can hang around here and wait for the bomb to go off, or we can go to my party.
Oh yes, I was getting to that, Your Honor.
Personally, I don't know what Mr. Cedar's raving about. From what I can see, no matter what system of government we have, there will always be leaders and always be followers.
I'm not worrying any more. I suppose they'll go on writing them till they get tired. You don't believe all that stuff, do you?
You can almost spit on it, can't you?
Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
In part, yes.
Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
So do I.
My office.
Well, isn't there some other place? It's rather confidential, what I have to say.
Go ahead.
Monsieur Blaine, I wonder if I could talk to you?
Well, I forgive you this time. But I'll be in tomorrow night with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she loses. Uh huh!
Put it down as a gesture to love.
Why do you interfere with my little romances?
Yeah? Why?
You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca. It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You know what I have been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of thousands and thousands of people that I be free to reach America and continue my work.
Right.
We're looking for a suspect. We've reason to believe he's still in the area.
I guess not.
I see. Well, I guess we don't have much to say to each other.
Aw, I do. But 'seems to me us colored folks do a whole lot of church-goin'. It's the whites that need it real bad.
Why? Don't you believe in the Lord?
I doubt it.
I think if you tried livin' in a town like this, instead of running free and easy, you'd soon change your tune.
Can't live without trouble, can you? Nice place you got here. Real nice.
I guess I ain't.
Me too.
No, I wasn't, actually.
Quite a compliment coming from you, doctor.
The names are Merwyn D. Mayor, who is the Mayor's brother-in-law --
After all I've done for you --
Four of Mr. Hartman's Deputy Sheriffs were rushed to the hospital --
A fine fair-weather friend you are!
Howard Shenken, the Sheriff's uncle on his mother's side --
Not at all.
That's right, Fran. And I'm a doctor.
Fran, I'm a doctor. I'm here because you took too many sleeping pills. Do you understand what I'm saying? Fran, I'm Dr. Dreyfuss -- I'm here to help you. You took all those sleeping pills -- remember?
Miss Kubelik -- Fran.
What's her name?
Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus Christ.
Dr. Dreyfuss.
You forget yourself, Homer. This here's my daughter! You got your own mess to deal with--ain't that right?
Merthiolate, ether, vulval pads, gauze--lots of gauze.
There ain't no almost about this stuff, Homer--ain't that right?
Honey what a pleasant surprise, sorry to keep you waiting.
How do I know what's being said?
Here... Here...
Gentlemen, I wish you a good day. Will you please go to the house from whence we set out this morning, and tell my man there to send my baggage on to Three Kings at Dresden?
Then ordering fresh horses, the Chevalier set off on his journey for that capital. I need not tell you that I was the Chevalier.
I have no luggage.
Hi.
I love you -- remember?
I'm sure. If you'll just tell me that you still love me --
Fran --
I promise.
Left? When? I just come from his place and there was no one there. A neighbour of his...
Goddamnit, Mav, you really are a slow learner. Don't worry, Fung, I've got it.
Yawing right.
Intelligent beyond our comprehension.
Not exactly. It exists in a continuum that wasn't proven until ten years ago, a higher mathematical dimension superimposed on top of the Universe. An infinite number of them, in fact. It was a violation of all of our various laws regarding the Universe, Space, or Space-Time. It was completely counter-intuitive. We had to unlearn everything.
Rudder's left, stick's forward.
What do you remember?
All right. How about I feel better when you take them?
Depends how you look at it. I Mean it's not like anybody's Holding a gun to their heads.
What would you say if I told you I was a member of an elite task force employed to safeguard our nation s most precious resource: your daughter.
What're you going to do?
Sorry, Babe. Sorry. It would have made a swell story. I just got carried away. That's too bad. So he proposed to you, huh? What a twist! You set out to nail him - and he
Say, you haven't gone and fallen for that mug, have you?
Proposed to you! You mean he asked you to marry him?
Why, Babe - that's terrific! "Cinderella Man Woos Mystery Girl! Who is the Mysterious Girl That "
I told you not to read all that crap!
Is that how you think of yourself?
Let's go have dinner, shall we?
I... uh... I don't know. I guess don't like to think about it.
I want you here.
Maybe, yeah. Hell, I don't know.
Me? No - most ordinary guy in the world, me. Only one thing wrong with me
Yeah, I haven't figured out the plot yet, but it's laid in a Siberian village.
Well, you could make this table a little - uh - a little less wide. There is something you can do for me, Miss Schuyler.
I know but that was news. This is blackmail and I don't like blackmail.
Is that what you gave him?
Yeah.
Do you know where he got the dumper?
Maybe, if you tell me the things you haven't.
What do you think?
Hello?
You killed her!
You murdered her!
Who's there? Anyone there?
Enzo, Enzo! Congratulations!
You must be related to the Lavals of Marseilles.
M'sieu Laval, I have enjoyed the confidence of this family--
Yes, everything is getting worse. But everything is also getting better.
I want to go back to the Clock People. I kind of miss those fool redskins and wonder what they're up to. What's happened to Jelly?
You mean she's dead?
Easy come, easy go.
You know their workforce. Two-thirds at least fall into the category. We'll be closing down their operation for days. At least go with a fingertip sample or urine.
It is hard to believe he could be one of their elite workers. You've seen their security system. They know who works there. Even if you ignore the man's expiration date, his profile suggests that he doesn't have the mathematical propensity let alone the stamina to pass their physicals.
None of the ID photos match the enhancement.
It's still possible the eyelash specimen came from a janitor, delivery man--it could have blown in through an open window.
It's an ethnic curl, I can't do anything about it.
Hi. Turn on your TV... Good Morning America, the Morning News and Today are all about to talk to Arnold Schwarzenegger and I think he's live on at least two of them.
Now listen, Arnold just said that he's been making three million a movie now. But he's not ever gonna change. He's still the same person when he was making two million dollars a movie. He feels no different. He also bought a brand- new condo with Maria, they gonna furnish tastefully.
Ready.
Okay, I'll see you in the lobbies .
Does Chicago count?
Oh, I see, you write both sides of the conversation?
What's that to miss?
Well, maybe I am laughing a bit... I just thought, as long as you're here, it would be nice for you to relax into the place a little.
What's wrong with a magic trick?
... How could I what?
Look. If there was some mistake...
They'll be here. Don't worry. My men are picking them up.
That was the damndest thing I ever saw.
It deliberately came down at you -- you're bleeding...
Zuzu's petals.
Okay, you were right. I hated my column, but I can do this assignment.
No. It's perpetual motion.
Then you've got it. If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot.
I saw it. Gee, look at that thing swing, will you? Do you think it never stops?
I came to play pool, Fats.
That's good, Eddie. For how much?
You name it.
Why am I doing this to you? Isn't this what you wanted?
Let's make it three thousand dollars a game, Fats. C'mon, three thousand dollars. That's my bankroll, my life's savings. What's the matter, Fats? All you gotta do is beat me the first game and I'm on my way back to Oakland.
Let's go.
If you need a minute, that's okay. But I thought you'd want to --
Stop calling me David. We're on set, for Christ's sake, you don't have to call me David here.
Betty, I thought this would be the best way. You know, throw you into it...
I'm sorry, but... the Stones...
Oh, brother.
The switch. Hit the switch.
And it's especially nice to be among friends tonight, because, well, tonight's a very special night for my brother and I. This evening we've asked a young lady to join us, a lady Jack and I are sure will soon seem like just another old friend to you all. She's making her debut here this evening and, as far as I'm concerned, she couldn't be doing it in a better place. Because there's one place that's always been for us a very special place, and that place is this place, the Ambassador Lounge. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome a very special lady with a very special way of singing a song, Miss Susie Diamond.
I think we're in trouble. I don't know how or why this started, but I know it's here and I know we'd be crazy to ignore it.
Right. Give me your pen. We'll tell 'em to bill Kyle.
It was perfect.
And it's just in one ear?
Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
When did you first notice this?
I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
Welcome.
Never a break. Never.
That's very thoughtful.
I -- uh, I... Well, there is no place cards or anything.
Yeah.
What the hell are you doing?!?
By stealing my car?
You know this guy, don't you?
This is what I do. I do this every day.
This place is a perk, Kate.
How about hand-to-hand combat?
Oh sure.
And to use the bayonet? PACHOIE!
Oh, sure. A variety of weapons.
Yes.
Another man's life in your sights.
To strangle someone. Choke him. Squeeze out his life between your hands.
Yes.
Yes. Hi..Congratulations. Jack Lucas. Nice to meet you finally. This is Anne Napolitano, the owner of Video Spot.
He must have something or he wouldn't be pressing so hard.
There's always a surprise.
Then the vault, how to get in the vault, that's stumping me.
So how long till we do this?
You've thought of everything.
You can't be serious.
You're out of your mind. We can't do a job like this with no rehearsal.
Is that the good new, Sir, or --
We can explain, Colonel.
Okay, pete.
No, we've got to get back Friday for the rehearsal dinner.
I am.
The climax comes at a higher cost; you must sit on my lap.
Ha! Go back! What a great line!
Oh yeah!
Why? It's fine. It's nice.
Get in. I'll pull you up to the fourth floor.
For who?
What's from the Governor?
What do you want?
I'm Sheriff Hartman. You want me?
No, no! Maybe we could interest you in some well done butterflies, or perhaps some slightly fried pansies, or better still, some stuffed shirts. And guaranteed every one of them will give you a good stiff pain in the neck.
Aw, you wanted to see some life in the raw, huh? Well gal, I'm afraid we ain't got no raw life up here.
Well, daughter of the slums - how did you get out of the ghetto?
Well, well! If it isn't my old friend! Turn around, gal! Let's get a look at you.
Gee Gallagher, do you look good! What are you doing to yourself?
A cab? Ma, come on. My car's just a half block down. You wait here.
He's drunk.
Tuesday at seven, at the Hinkley firehouse.
No, we're not. Jack?
I guess you're,right. Well, what do you say we get a little midnight snack? Theo's should still be open.
You sure?
No.
Riding with Judith.
Not true. Besides, Jack's the romantic.
Five years, maybe, for a trial. Double that for the appeal.
Both.
You're in an ideal position -- he trusts you. Besides, you said yourself, women make the best spies.
Agents.
I don't know -- but I think you'd better find out, don't you?
Me? Why me?
No, Mrs. Lampert. His death is registered with the War Department in Washington.
Oh. Then who's this one?
OKAY... OKAY. BUT IF I LAND THIS THING UPSIDE DOWN. AND I LIVE. I'LL HAVE YOUR BUTT!
You'll have mine, Cougar. It'll be where your head used to be.
Spanish in Florida called him Juan Caballo. John Horse.
Hey, Bert. Wait a minute!
I finished that. I'm just messing around.
So you're going into the Army?
Homework?
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
How's Butkus this mornin'?
Ain't your fault -- Here's the problem.
No prob, I could use the company. I've been on the road going on fifteen hours straight.
That must make it tough.
Nah. I'm... I'm nothing.
Hm?
So this...foam you found in the lungs. How does it get there?
Firenze.
You want me to read this or not?
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player?
To make a gentleman out of a tramp?
How-di-do.
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane...
We disagree on how God-awful it was. Why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?
It's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?
I got promoted for things like that.
This rabbit'll do anything not to do time, including wearing a wire.
This is a one-way argument. We've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it -- we'll come home. If you don't go? Well, that's a much bigger deal. I go to London right after that. So, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. The plane's boarding. You're good at deadline. Here's your ticket.
A bit fucking late.
I'm not sure.
And your wife is aware of or has evidence of your activities?
Seems like there's more of it than ever before --
Well, with the expanding global population -- Let me ask you this -- your wife. Has she pursued the opportunities which must present themselves to the "knock-out, sexy woman" you described?
I don't know. I can assume...
Not in court you can't. Has she retained counsel?
No. Not exactly. It didn't exactly cool. Marylin is a knock-out. And very sexy -- but -- there's a lot of it out there.
Ah.
You know what I mean when I say "it."
Gotcha. No need to get anatomically correct with me, Rex.
Yeah Vick?
No, actually I was thinking of becoming a brain surgeon.
-- Trucking ain't the easiest life in the world. I mean, you can't make it much past fifty and you sure as shit don't get a gold watch when you hang it all up. But I like keeping on the move. You know?
Still drawing a blank.
I guess if there's one lesson I've learned, it's that even misery has a tough time hitting a moving target. I forgot your question?
Well, did you find me?
What'll I say?
I see. And what would you do if "she" walked in her right now? WYATT "She"?
I don't know. Probably ignore her.
What's that?
I'll remember you said that.
Come on. Frozen. How much are they?
She knows.
We've got to fix this.
Oh, I know, I know... It looks awfully bad. It's really embarrassing. But it was Bob's idea.
Alan...
Wrong...
Dave'?
Absolutely. Well, that might be kind of tough. Once the press starts smelling blood...
Shut up and turn to page 64.
I really am sorry.
Thank you for coming.
I think I got in trouble. A little bit of trouble....
What's up?
....I made a call..... ....and, uh....
What happened?
They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
What's gonna happen?
Well, it's a big canyon. Honey, I'm sorry but I've gotta get back... just for a minute.
Where?
What're you talking about?
you woke me up to tell me that?
Well, like what?
I think you should wear that.
I like that. A gun to your head and you ask about your partner. He's okay. May have a headache for a few days. Are you here with honorable intentions?
You're welcome. Where's my partner?
Thank you.
Keep the phone open. I'll call back. Stay calm. He's got some good doctors out there.
Alright, I'm freaking too. But they need you to stay calm. I'll call back. 124.
Reach for it and throw it to me. And... My finger s on the trigger, you hear!
Almost four years.
Four hundred bucks.
You're wonderin'...how come I never ask. If you did it.
Seems like I needed a ball when I was trying to be like my pops...or trying to be better than him. Now, I kinda think I need to try something else.
That a nice way of saying I rode the bench?
Because I'm kinda feeling that way, too.
Maybe go back to school.
He's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.
He knows where she lives?
What's to discuss?
Well, you know -- there's the prestige of the job title... and the benefits package is pretty good...
So call her up. Tell her don't talk to any Cubans.
Do you think memory can be washed away like a few spots of blood?
Not even the birds sing sweet as you.
There's no happier thought under heaven.
My lady mocks me.
"I was a posthumous child. My father's eyes had closed upon the light of this world six months, when mine opened on it."
It is. I'll get this. You go ahead.
Uh, sure--that's what Kong thinks, all right.
Not exactly... Can we just take a minute here? Maybe get a cup of coffee or something...?
You re not married, are you?
Sure, baby. 'Fact, I don't ever have to work no more. When that baby comes, I can just stay home and send you back to school. How about that?
Yeah!
What the hell could you do?
'You kiddin'? You ain't goin' to no white home. I seen the way they look at you when you go down the street.
Well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?
But those are my roommate's sodas...
Nobody's as evil as my brothers. Those dudes put the wick in wicked.
You have the power to change the cola in that can into any other liquid -- engine oil, bat's blood, moose piss. You just have to release the evil within you.
Why don't we talk about it later?
I bet that's all the hacks they send out. Otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.
I'm not stepping anywhere --
I appreciate your gentlemanliness, Bill, but what we need to do here is drive the dagger home --
How do you know how to draw the red line anyway?
Sure, I'm sorry. Hope you don't mind me plugging in to your battery. Mine's dead... How can I help? What can I do?
Milking?
Maybe milking.
Oh, he did. Half an hour later a certain Timothy J. Nolan went into secret session with the Commission and he did all the talking.
It was a big nothing! The Father did all the talking.
Nothing happened, he says. Some operator you got yourself there, Charley. One more like him and we'll all be wearing striped pajamas.
Nothing happened, Johnny.
I got it. Hot off the press.
How'd you get that.
He don't, huh? Well, he knows thirty-nine pages worth of our operation.
You mean Kayo Nolan, the old timer? He doesn't know much.
It's not particularly my beloved Paris.
Songs. 'He's A Rebel', 'Leader Of The Pack', 'Town Without Pity', that Dusty Springfield song 'I Only Want To Be With You'. That's what I hear anyway. Her behaviour was the main thing the doctors' report used against you. So even if she would see me, which she won't, I couldn't put her on camera anyway. If I ask her, 'Mallory, are you insane?' And she starts singing 'Dead Skunk In The Middle Of The Road', that blows our whole case.
Then don't... just have 'em beat me up or whatever you're gonna do.
I love Lucy!
You nut!
Thank-Q!
Well, I know Mom sure likes 'em!
So, Adam...where on earth are you from?
It's a very small place. People don't even know it's there.
Oh. Right.
Certainly.
....Hi.....
Why did you stop?
No. I wouldn't say that. National Geographic isn't exactly the hub of artistic inspiration. They like their wild life in focus and without any personal comment. I don't mind really. I'm not artist. I'd faced that a long time ago. It's the course of being well-adjusted. I'm too normal.
Homer, you know I would never kill anyone--you know I wouldn't.
Hello, can I have room 5601.
Stay with it, Buddy-boy! Come on, Sylvia.
A little mixup in signals. Let's go.
What's your mother doing this afternoon?
Why don't we send her to a movie -- like Ben-Hur?
Sometimes I want to meet them so I can kill them. Just sometimes.
You cook very well!
Gimme the God damn ball!
Switch nostrils?
How was that?
If I throw too hard I'll hurt the kid.
That doesn't make him an expert.
"The Day After Yesterday."
Yeah, I know. It's kind of weird. Out of context.
Well, it's a little difficult to summarize. It begins as a first-person account of a guy taking care of his father after a stroke. Kind of based on personal experience, but only loosely.
Yeah. Definitely.
Uh... I'd like to show them that I can cook, a little.
You had a heart attack?
Lock the door and the window -- and don't let anyone in except me. I'll be back in a minute.
Out of the window, I guess -- I didn't see him.
I think I sprained my pride. Where'd he go?
Peter -- are you all right?
You took the words right out of my mouth.
Be careful, Peter.
Mr. Cedar is, and I haven't seen him in two days. Listen, Cedar, we've got to do something about the newspapers.
I've got to put these tapes in some kind of order... and... Oh, I should get my sports jacket cleaned... ... There's coffee if you want...
He says if I want to get back to work, no problem. He wants me to come in and talk and... and... that's it!
I'm not interested in the newspapers.
Yeah . . . . . . you can take this one off now.
Yes, some of it is speakable.
You'll stand by me?
What about you, Delly?
Come on, Delly, look at the country today. We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... You think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, "Sand Pirates of the Sahara?"
The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.
I doubt it. She's just an...
I hope so!
Thanks.
Now defendant's father had also died by that point. Where was the defendant? When you sent his family their equity.
You could give me your baseball, so I can drive this bastard nuts.....He's been playing chequers for eight hours and still hasn't won a game.
I can't remember all these things. What am I learning?
But what am I gonna transform??
What are you gonna become, Raziel? Queen of the rodents?
We haven't any chips, Mr. Brett--Do you mind playing with cash?
A steady job and a few bucks extra, that's all I wanted.
I hope so.
Boss loader!
I'll bet a couple of hundred-- I wonder what's keeping that boy.
There's a slot for a boss loader on the new pier we're opening up.
Or is it the other way round? The children are needed because you can t satisfy him?
What s in the bag? Underwear? To seduce your husband? Or is it for your own recreation? Tell me, how come such a handsome couple sleep in seperate bedrooms? Is it because he does it with little children?
Black suits you.
Aren t you curious to know about Friedman?
How did you break into my office, Deborah? Ladies of your standing don t learn to pick locks between shopping trips. Come on, Deborah! Acting dumb doesn t suit you! Who knew I d found dirt on your brother, huh? Who knew it was in an envelope? Taking me for dead, who d want to make sure it didn t fall into the wrong hands?
Ask Simon.
Give the guy air. Everyone to a neutral corner.
You did well...
Oh right. I mean, I am a friend -- I'm not a lunatic but -- no, you basically...
It's a guy you know.
Tell me I'm on the way in.
They fired me.
I never knew Hildy to be so determined before.
You haven't seen anything yet.
Let's just figure that out later -- Ok. I gotta go. I'm just gonna go now and I'll call you from there, you're in charge 'till I get back. And don't tell my sisters anything? He exits.
How am I supposed to know what to do if you don't say it -- if it's not in your rules and regulations in your fine print how am I supposed to know how to be with this --
No, no, no, no, nO, NO, NO!
....now: this pudding?
Yeah.
No, no. She doesn't.
Why Edie, I
I wish I knew, Edie, But
Okay. Thanks a lot. Here I go.
Then get in your jammies and I'll read you a story... I think you've got a chance. The only real enemy you have is her ability to think logically -- the best thing you have going for you is your willingness to humiliate yourself if it gives you one chance in whatever -- so go catch her off- guard.
I forgot to lock the door.
What's wrong?
Were you asleep?
'Cause if you were asleep -- I'm sorry. And you could be grouchy.
Three men on matched roans?
-- then I've friends of my own to visit.
I have.
You keep strange company, Abbe. But if you truly have matters in hand here --
He's more than a patient, Doctor; the Marquis is my friend --
He's sworn to obedience.
And --?
I spoke to him with reason and compassion; the tools which serve us best here.
To get me in a mood to sell -- double what I paid. But your company doesn't have enough capital right now to buy anything.
Susan wants to come. She says she's in love with me.
Done.
Cindy the manicurist.
I like it. This whole thing is pretty incredible. I think you could probably sell this lamp idea in New York.
Tough titty, it's mine now.
You think I'm just a gravy-train rider in a turned-around collar?
Like that?
Your hot-ass temper.
See, that's why you ain't getting recruited.
I don't notice anyone else complaining.
Two bucks a buckle, Perryman. Look at that shine! Boonies'll cost you five.
Come here, baby.
Everything you cook is good.
Smells like something crawled in there and died.
Plan to.
Then what is it?
Hmmm - good coffee.
What about them?
Which is what?
Trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel- ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. And above all, not hurting the object of your love.
Observe.
You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are?
He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
So?
What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
Why? Are you waiting for someone else?
No, you look like a hooker.
Uh huh.
Here, babe.
Yep.
Very interesting. I'm learning a lot about manure. What's that?
Well, they're mine now.
No, the very same one, my boy. He recovered from his wound. The ball you hit him with was not likely to hurt him. It was only made of tow. Do you think the Dugans would let you kill fifteen hundred a-year out of the family? The plan of the duel was all arranged in order to get you out of the way, for the cowardly Englishman could never be brought to marry from fear of you. But hit him you certainly did, Roderick, and with a fine thick plugget of tow, and the fellow was so frightened that he was an hour in coming to. We told your mother the story afterwards, and a pretty scene she made.
He has paid off your uncle's mortgage. He gave Dorothy a coach- and-six. That coward of a fellow has been making of your uncle's family. Faith, the business was well done. Your cousins, Michael and Harry, never let him out of their sight, though he was for deserting to England, until the marriage was completed, and the happy couple off on their road to Dublin. Are you in want of cash, my boy? You may draw upon me, for I got a couple of hundred out of Master Best for my share and, while they last, you shall never want.
A bride without a head!
Stop it!
I feel tight -- but good.
In the gut, I mean.
Twelve. Cross side.
Boy, he is great! Jeez, that old fat man. Look at the way he moves. Like a dancer.
Got you here.
We're here because we're the best flyers in the wing. Not because of some MiG encounter.
What do you think it was? Was it that MiG contact that did it?
Did what?
What do these guys think, I made Cougar quit?
Pay no attention to it. They're just trying to rattle you. It's all psychological. Sit down..and drink.
I don't get it. How does a guy like that get this sudden reputation?
We did it with the best intentions...
Yes, Comrade?
With two f's, if you please.
We didn't want to get mixed up with lawyers. They are very expensive here. If you just say hello to a lawyer... well, there goes another cow.
We dealt directly with the representative of the Grand Duchess. I am sure if we call him he will give you a very clear picture.
I left my phone number in your undies. Try not to lose it in traffic.
Sorry, Kitty! I'll be right back after I choke my monkey.
Yes, the Mamma is is there.
Sinister is what I'd call it...! Ours is so much cheerful! Why don't you come and stay with me... There's plenty of room in my suite.
Don't let us make you nervous or nothin'--we know you gotta job to do.
No, a year ago! Where did you live a year ago!!?
I'm a quick learner.
You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
So! You want to make a strike breaker out of me! I am surprised at you, Comrade! Is it too much for the workers of the world to ask you to walk around the corner for lunch? All I can say to you is take your hammer and sickle and get out of that Royal Suite!
You've all been talking about it? Behind my back? Talking about it?
No, no, no. It's cool. I talked to Victoria. She's cool. Everyone's cool.
Yeah, two more chairs and they got a dining-room set.
'Cause I wanna watch the Knicks on television.
I'm so tired of spending evenings making fake insights with people who work for Dysentery.
Oh, really, I heard that Commentary and Dissent had merged and formed Dysentery.
Oh, right away. That's why you never saw me with anyone. You should've noticed that. I miss him, though. I think I made a mistake.
Jesus...
When did this happen?
I'm not Snow.
I got rid of him. I wanted to see if... I wanted to be the only one. I wanted to be Snow.
Bert! Thank heaven you're here!
Nix, the law!
The company. We all work for the company.
I ahh, better go.
Good enough.
He's a colored man in chauffeur's uniform carrying a basket of fruit.
Old Spice, Phil says it's a timeless classic.
Dead at forty-one.
Let me have one of those cigars. Kinda nice in here. You run it?
That's all right with me. Always liked kids.
Doesn't mean shit. Get her to a doctor. You can't do anything until you hear what he says. Make the appointment yourself.
No, but she's gotta be at least a month late.
His will.
Carlos De Moraes?
No, you're not. Give me that dollar seventy.
By the way, Laurence, were you here last time your mistress s brother came over? You know, just before he disappeared?
Hello, Jane. It s me.
Mrs De Moraes must have taken it hard, eh? Her brother s death.
Yeah, so I hear. Don't you think you should go get changed?
Well come on, sit down.
See you brought one of the patients with you too.
What would you like, beer?
Okay honey, but don't be long. I got plans.
None of my business, Fred.
Why don't you just leave it alone?
What have I done, Mr. Fennyman?
Foley made me think of that fella Carl Tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. You recall that?
Liz, hold on a second -- What?
Marie LaSalle is in the store! Here, she's here, and now!
Rob.
Actually, I'm fine. I'm great. Last night I got to thinking, "you know what? Maybe it is time to move on. Maybe we're just not right for each other. Or maybe we are. But time will tell and at this point I'm going to be fine with whatever's meant to be." You know?
Why? You think he might tell you where I am?
I can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip-and-fall and whiplash cheaters.
That's how you score now?
It isn't the money. We're after circulation. What we need is fireworks. People who can hit with sledge hammers start arguments.
The monkey, of course. It was his idea.
And I don't need your goddamn permis- sion either! You! Drew! I don't need anyone to tell me how to run my life.
Where are we going? I'm going to buy you two lunch -- didn't Hildy tell you?
No -- she didn't.
Attaboy! Come on, Bruce.
Where are we going?
Well, er -- it looked a little cloudy this morning.
That's right. -- Rubbers, too, I hope? A man ought to be prepared for any emergency.
Oh.
But I see, she didn't mean old in years. You always carry an umbrella, Bruce?
Mr. -- well -- no -- no -- not at all.
You see, my wife -- I mean, your wife -- that is, I mean Hildy -- had led me to expect that she was marrying a much older man.
Nonsense. We didn't steal it. There's no law against stealing stolen money.
I thought he was out of town.
You take a lot for granted.
Is that what you think I was thinking?
If duty and safety are served by the same end then, aye, I do.
I promise. Is that all?
One more thing. If you find a healthy young woman, bring her back with you.
Adult Bookstore. Why?
Poison gas. Invisible. Don't forget.
Yes, sir. Is that all?
Yes, father?! Yes?
...the pipe tobacco.
Heck, I know that mom! You're my parents.
Adam...don't forget...don't forget ...
That's pretty.
Are you sure this is the town he lives in?
Good morning.
Can you locate XXI5639I?
No, she s not.
Pro bono. You don t get paid at all. Nobody makes a dime. Well, bravo...
You re kidding me...
Well, I guess I'm going to have to take a mulligan on this one.
Haven't you opened it?
I've got something in my bag.
Raw.
Don't you ever cook anything?
Why can't they just shake hands and be friends?
How can you say that you 'admire' them?
I'm in California most of the time. Traveling a lot on business. That's about it, really.
I'm going to give a party, and invite all of the suspects.
Got a nice evening dress?
Mimi...
What novel did you read.
Mimi, Jorgensen, Morelli, Tanner.....
Your husband! Mrs. Robinson! There's something we could have a conversation about.
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit fairly last night.
It's not breakfast yet.
I just wanted to relieve your mind. Your father's alive and all right.
That's good, memories are good sweetheart. Vada, I'm sorry; I was trying to keep it from you, I just couldn't. You're a good girl, and I want you to be happy; don't be an old grump like me. Seeya in the morning.
What's the best thing I can see tonight?
Yes, it is. Now, I want to look at an evening dress, a dinner dress, black -- short -- long sleeves -- with a neck cut this... ...and the skirt out.
You always said I was a bum. Well not anymore. I'm going down to the dock. Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot anybody. I'm just going to get my rights. Joey's jacket. It's time I start wearing it.
We have a new directive. I'm taking over.
No, sweetie, not yet.
That's what I do. Do you wanna do it??
Look if you think you know how, why don't you pre-measure the briquettes in little packages, put out a product, support me for a while!
It is for us to determine whether you are a good Christian, not you.
So when did Buddy leave?
No, no they know another track - to the side of this.
It's a toss-up, I can tell you that.
Another woman?
A gat! A gat! Got any fireworks on you?
Why no
I can use a smart guy like you.
Do you pack a gat? A CLOSE VIEW of the TWO shows the smile dying on Shapeley's face. He looks up quickly.
Huh?
That's right.
Top o' the morning, Mrs. Worley.
He offered you money?
That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
Yeah. Would you like to come up and have a drink?
With all due respect, Bill, I'm not asking your permission.
All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
Okay, enough -- Now, look, Erin -- this incident aside, I don't think this is the right place for you. So what I'm gonna do is make a few calls on your behalf. Find you something else, okay?
Thank you.
No.
Yeah. I don't ever know what to say.
You said...
Hi.
But I went back to my food. The next thing I remember, I felt someone sitting next to me and I saw the orange sleeve out of the corner of my eye.
Washington thinks it's too late for that.
I ll call again.
Oh, you should see your face.
Why were you yelling like that?!
Can I have the reception desk, please.
If we didn't have election Tuesday I'd have this on my conscience.
Sure.
What would you do, Dad?
You awake?
Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer. I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
Yes.
Hey--I want to ask you something.
Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor. Would you do it?
Shoot, Jimbo.
It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
Gimme the big knife! I'm gonna cut my throat!
Four.
Nice one.
Could you help me-- what was the name of that girl who just came in...
You wanna see if he has more shells, go ahead. I say we wait...
Right. Okay. Good.
If we went out that window right now we'd have a chance...
I've got the working gun, Elden, me! You wasted all your bullets so you crawl out there.
He sits down at the table and says to the waiter... Did you get that too?
Wait, Betty... you still haven't answered me.
It's about forty miles from here. I don't know if you've looked at a map, it's close to London but it's a city in itself. A Roman city. It's a nice house. I'm having a problem with ants. I uh... It's the warmer weather. I can't seem to find the nest. Sorry, do you understand "ants"?
Hey--she's in a tough situation. I cut her some slack--
She's pulled herself out of a pretty rough neighborhood.
I don't know what you mean, Miss Ilsa.
Oh I can't remember it, Miss Ilsa. I'm a little rusty on it.
Well, from Italy to Iowa -- that's a story! Whereabouts in Italy?
You don't look like a native, if you don't mind my saying so.
Oh, yeah. Actually, I had an assignment in Greece and I had to go through Bari to get the boat at Brindisi. But it looked so pretty I got off and stayed for a few days. Breathtaking country.
Oh yeah, Bari. I've been there.
Yeah. Excuse me a sec.
If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
Mr. Preysing has too scrupulous a regard for certainties...
Ah, come on -- we're going home.
Then, it's all over?
Yes --
You've decided against the merger?
Sorry, Preysing.
Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out. Concentrate. Begin to see something?
Yes --
Never mind. Just do it! Retrieve the arrows somehow.
Fight's over before it's begun... soon the survivors will be in full retreat.
Defend ourselves. We've bested far worse already.
Easily spoken...
Don't loose heart... Assemble the archers. Have everyone not holding a shield man a bow. Shoot the damned things as they fly.
There aren't enough arrows.
Anything left for smashing you may happily smash.
Mmmm. Well, it was a piece of luck running into you, Duane. I thought I was gonna have to take Wesley out and hose him down. All he talks about is those Japanese gals.
What part of Dixie are you from, Duane?
I like 'em small. When you're inside a little Asian chick, it's like your dick is the axle that holds her body together.
I'm a Yankee, myself. Massachusetts.
We can live with that.
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him.
Really.
Another one Faye Dunaway was in I liked, Three Days of the Condor.
I'm just saying I think if we met under different circumstances...
You're not on the beat.
These rooms are solid stone. They haven't changed.
Yes, you can. You can spoil a perfectly nice dance.
Ready?
Did you break up with Charlie?
Okay. Goodnight.
Who are you trying to convince?
Sorry. Don't know a thing.
She's crazy, she wants to go to school over the summer.
It doesn't work, it always stays black.
Wouldn't have known you.
Wouldn't have known you.
Where's he at?
'You Will Anderson?
Who're you?
Amish.
I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
I wish you'd stop being playful.
What stuff is that?
Zenovitch was about to deliver a list of names tonight street chemists... the guys processing this P2P into speed.
What have you got?
Years ago, I worked for the C.I.A. in the M.K. ULTRA program. Are you familiar with it?
Please, sit.
What I'm about to tell you is partially documented. The Freedom of Information Act saw to that. But much more of it isn't. For reasons which will soon be regrettably clear, I'm going to share -- secrets -- with you. Repeat any of it and you'll simply bestow the title of 'paranoid' upon yourself.
If you're as impressed to see me as I am to see you, you're very impressed indeed. How's Jerry feeling this morning?
So one of them got to him.
A man... under stands one day... that his life is built on nothing. And that's a bad, crazy day.
I'll take his place, all right? Put the gun to my head.
Watch your step!
That's it.
Bontecou wants a quick response and --
The answer is no, quick enough for you?
I forgot how cute you look. When you get impossible.
Me, too. I'm getting married tomorrow.
Hello, Bill.
You'd hate him for the trick.
She dropped in on me... holding this.
That's me. But I don't know who she is... where did you find her?
She's not my bride, she's my fare. She's looking for this Vito Cornelius. According to the phone guide he lives here.
It plays in 50 states.
How many people do you think heard that thing last night?
Nobody else is going to know it was us.
Weddings are one floor down. Congratulations.
No, I know, but... but, you know, I'm all perspired and everything.
Excuse me, I'm looking for a priest.
Vito Cornelius?
You're not that bad... Come on we'll get you to a doctor.
I didn't see any point. Dyle's dead.
Dead? Mr. Bartholomew -- maybe you'd better tell me what this thing's all about.
So. What should I do now?
Goddamn it, Alabama, you gotta get the fuck outta there! How much longer before he's slappin' you around? Punchin' you in the stomach? How the fuck did you get hooked up with a douche-bag like this in the first place?
I need to talk to you.
I was parked in day parking.
Okay.
I'm going to tear down the shack and build my house.
There's nothing anymore to stop me.
Caf .
Jeez... that sounds awful. Hey, what do you say we go out to dinner tonight, catch up on old times?
No, it was a good thing. I mean, good in that it was very quick.
I remember that speech really well.
Nope, nope -- dodged a few bullets. God, I cannot believe I'm standing here with Mary Jenson.
Oh... are you... ?
I love you.
Yes I know.
I need to know who you are first please.
What did he say?
He says he feels safe here.
Oh. We are Russian.
Yes. I know.
They'll want more than your word for that.
History.
I should say not.
My father proposed to my mother in there.
Mom and Dad. I used to be in my crib and I'd listen to them fight.
Hello. Would you like to join me, Quince and Allison for a nightcap?
You bet ya, Coach.
He called her.
I guess I'll make me some trouble in that town.
Ouch. Too young! I just got that. You know how to hurt guy. How old are you?
Yeah.
Really. I mean it. I-I'll never play the piano again.
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm a wreck.
Good? I was-
No.....But I think Honza at the office has. You keep shifting this crap and I'll take care of the locks, shouldn't take long. Take a break for lunch and I'll catch you up later.
I'm making history Chris, nothings going to stop me. There could be a knighthood for us in this, once President Havel hears.
Yep, except a name for this place.
Tell them we're working for the University.
There's not that much down here, Colonel. Big O's is the only place in the county that our African American soldiers are uhm--that they feel comfortable in.
Okay now, before we get started here, there's a few things we have to get clear about.
Is that right?
He's all yours.
I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
What a pity.
I don't know what the big deal is.
I'm sorry.
Small bed. Maybe I should sleep in the barn.
You're spending forty-three million dollars on an ad campaign to... 'Boost consumer confidence in the American auto industry.'
Yes, Bob. Choices... Now the Commerce Department..,
Perceptual?
Does it make the cars any better?
Why?
If we would walk out so soon, it would only call attention to us. Perhaps Ugarte's in some other part of the cafe.
I'll lay odds you get a pair of 'em--Why, a high-school kid could take you saps--and another thing--Lay off Sally Marsh. --"Honest Jack"! One look at your mug and the whole world buttons up its pockets.
In that case--you owe us exactly sixteen hundred dollars.
They're fine.
Well, rack up your cue. We're leavin'.
Oh fuck...
Hey, can you sneak me on the lot?
How're the hands?
I didn't ask him can he beat you. I already know he can beat you. I asked him will he? With Eddie, that's two different things.
Have you noticed, Bert? This fellow here bears a striking resemblance to you. It seems as though you might have modeled for the artist.
Have you got a pen?
Where did you hear that, one of those American talk shows? Check, please.
Take a hike. Am-scray.
Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place. Now, I need a moment alone.
What's his rent?
Wouldn't blame him if he was.
Jesus.
I thought you ought to know, Arlyn Page is dead.
Don't play dumb with me, Mickey. You know what I mean. Describe Mallory. What's up here? What's in here?
That's indescribable.
Well, riddle me this, Batman. How do you feel about the fact that you're never gonna see Mallory again?
Says who?
And how long was it before they caught up with you?
The ninth?
And so now you're off to Glades.
Hejira.
Where did you steal the car?
Here!
I should have read the fine print. I love you Holly, thanks.
God, I think I need a holiday.
Doesn't make sense.
I wouldn't think so.
This should cover it, Auggie-Doggie.
The best part was that there was a 'this'. To debate the wrongness of.
You don't know the chicken places around where you live? Ask the guy at the place where a chicken place is.
I'm really not very -
You know what would taste good? Chicken. I haven't had chicken in a while. Chicken would really hit the spot about now. Chicken and beer, definitly, absolutely, without a doubt. Where's a good chicken place around here?
Great book.
Him? He's a big baby. Why isn't he here with you telling me?
More Bad Luck! I don't like his face, Loretta. I don't like his lips. When he smiles I can't see his teeth. When will you do it?
I don't know. There's some tension between us. I'd hate to expose you to that.
No I'm not. Have you really looked at me? I'm short! Even for a Nelwyn!
Why can't you do it? You have mag- ical powers.
I'm not sure. I'd ask him, but he's uptown talking to his contacts.
Go on, do it. I don't need to hear any more.
They're excited! They're happy about destroying a whole city. Would they do that to a White Man's City? Never!
Well, then ask him his name!
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe!
Will you come with me?
Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie.
No... They're interesting guys. Each one of these guys has something going for him. I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest. One's a pretty good guitar player. And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that...
But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all. Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her. And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be.
Is that what I did to you? Is that what happened? Did I just not see you?
Sir, I would prefer if you didn't raise your voice. It's making my muscles tighten.
What do I tell your mother?
I can see why you put your faith in him. He's a genuine... good guy... Good at what he does. That's rare.
I'm a little worried --
I've come all this way and now Elora Dana's going to die!
Tidwell moves to a tan in a wheelchair, signs an autograph and moves on. Jerry alongside. The quarterback sucks, man. He's gonna get me killed.
Effective. But to tell you the truth, I've lost my passion for work.
Longer? It's getting shorter.
And these pan pizzas have opened up the doors to heaven?
Oh I see. You got your individual slices of hope, dignity, confidence, self-love, justice, and harmony.
So you eat-- read it everyday?
I can look at her, can't I? It's a free country.
I was only talkin' to her.
I'll be in my office.
What about tomorrow?
It's no big deal.
Apparently.
In the future, will you have to marry a girl before you have sex with her?
You mean you'll give a girl a pill and she'll want to have sex?
What will they be made of?
Silicon is from sand.
Will you take of f your blouse?
Well, you see, Thomas I figure the big problem is the supermarkets. But Patsy's shop, that's a specialized trade. The supermarkets don't carry Italian meat.
What happened to your money?
I know.
Thanks. For letting me in last night.
Listen, Runt--Quick! Where's the ice?
I've had enough family for one month, Frank.
I believe so.
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Holy shit! He said what I said!
Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
Are you Peggy Sue Kelcher?
On the instant. Everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.
Very well! Now that I know it, I will no longer love her.
Certainly, monseigneur, does not Your Excellency consider her worthy of love?
There's an old riddle about two tribes of Indians -- the Whitefeet always tell the truth and the Blackfeet always lie. So one day you meet an Indian, you ask him if he's a truthful Whitefoot or a lying Blackfoot? He tells you he's a truthful Whitefoot, but which one is he?
What's wr--?
Assholes. This happen to you?
Away from here.
Because he's wearing moccasins.
Come on.
Whitefoot, of course.
Come here.
Sir. You are going to give me a warning, Sir!
Oh, he's good.
Now you've testified that the deceased was a heavy man, and hard to bring out of the net.
Maybe distant cousins. They did have that egg shape in common.
Try some other ways.
Coffee?
Now where? Will?
Why not?
Hey, where are you going? You can't do this. I can't take a dog. Nobody's ever been in here before.
In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
Well, it ruins it for me if you have grass because, you know, I'm, like, a comedian-
Is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?
Soft! I will go along; An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
Yeah, but that's not-that's no good. I want the whole thing.
Did Katharine say? - Geoffrey has to fly back to Cairo.
If you ask me, I think we should make that run to Choo Choo Town and pick up that load of lumber. Nice. Easy. And within the law.
Also boring.
I don't know, man. Ask him?
We gotta let the slack out, Cledus; this is costing us time.
See.
But I still don't think...
What are you doin' now?
That's your monkey, Denham.
They were just tasting the berries.
I got a lotta time to hear your theories and I wanta hear every damn one of 'em...but right now I'm tired and I don't wanta think about baseball and I don't wanta think about Quantum Physics... I don't wanta think about nothing... I just wanta be.
And a special thank you to Geoffrey and Katharine, without whose fund raising heroics we should still be kicking our heels. They toast the Cliftons.
The pearls are in her room.
No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
What?
Yeah, baby. Things are great. Listen, there's Devra, whatta you want?
The same as Jane McKenna.
I don't mind. If you think he can hold me.
No, it's an old football injury.
No, a couple of the players and me were joking around and, uh, I fell off the school.
Wait! He works for YOU?
Marylin!
Listen. I'll call you when we get there, and we can talk about it then, okay?
I don't know, Christine. Perhaps it's because I feel attacked.
Honey, I'm just saying you know I need a little space before the wedding. Isn't that the point of this? Isn't that what we talked about with Dr. Gertler?
I didn't dismiss you. I told you what I thought, but it didn't seem to matter, so you decide. Besides, this is supposed to be my time with Miles. I hope you're not going to call every five minutes.
Then put him with the Feldmans. Whatever you and your Mom decide is fine with me.
Cartwright.
Still lashed to the mast.
Well it's a last minute change.
Uh, Mr. President... I don't believe that's on your agenda today.
I don't think so.
Just as the freighter comes through? Isn't that quite a coincidence?
Nineteen... or thereabouts...
Maybe...?
Coincidences happen. You run a yellow light just as a car comes out of nowhere. Split-second tragedy happens every day. Or maybe...
But you could be wrong. He could have climbed up earlier.
Let me think about that. Want something to drink?
We'll do it together. I'll clue you in. Timing's got to be right. The old man says it's up to Joe.
Are you?
Yeah.
'It's up to Joe'? Those were his words?
...I know you're down, but you know when you're down, Drew, there's no place to go but up.
Never mind Bontecou. I've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and I'm putting them to see old man.
Thanks, Quince.
Yeah, that's what he said.
'It's up to Joe', huh?
You think I could make it to the Show as a manager?
Okay, Wayne, step forward.
Like I said, women get in the way sometimes.
You grey-haired old Judas!
Don't tease me. You know what I do for a living.
Who cares if you're never known as the first girl in the NBA. You'll get more play behind Quincy McCall's woman anyway.
So you're gonna act salty all night?
Throw that away.
Then prove her wrong.
Who's calling?
Blackheart. Aptly named.
Or perchance...
Sport, indeed.
Never.
I may have said perhaps...
It's my turn!
Nobody's named this one yet.
Where's the name sheet?
Life is waiting.
Really?
Thank you.
Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do. And someone will tell me what to do.
Then you'll be my best man.
Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best.
Of course we are. Of course.
If it's all right with you, I'm not hungry.
Hi, Mom.
If I don't save him, I don't know what I'm gonna do.
My dad's in hell, and he's falling apart.
I don't know, but I like it. Say. Your glasses are nice. They make your eyes look sparkly and big. It's fun to look at them.
Yeah. Deep south. She laughs along with him, not sure why.
Honey!
Sweetheart, no. Don't be ridiculous.
Three hundred thousand? What makes them do it, Ann? What makes them come and listen and, and get up their John Doe Clubs the way they do? I've been trying to figure it out.
Honey, it's not what you think.
How many people do you think we've talked to already, outside the radio, I mean?
Brunello di Montalcino, '85, please.
You know, I noticed you out at the pool even before we spoke. I could sense the chemistry between us.
And more...
I've read up on it. I'll deliver the baby myself if I have to.
Rather safe than sorry. That's my motto!
I just wanted to make sure.
Yes, sir.
Mr. Deeds - Mr. Deeds, sir - you really must get up. It's late!
You'll get it, Babe. You'll get it.
Yes, sir.
You're Walter, aren't you?
I've been dreading you.
A Prairie Oyster, sir.
What's that?
Gee, thoughts! Alla time thoughts! You really believe that drool?
I was about to ask you the same thing, going out with a college boy and all.
It's over, Jeanne. We won, just as you said!
Jeanne -- be careful -- you're not helping yourself by refusing to submit to our judgment...
What's that supposed to mean?
Means I got confidence that he's a loser. All the way a loser. You happen to be about only one-half loser -- the other half, winner. I'm finished.
You must have a lot of confidence in me.
I don't. But I got confidence in Findley.
Soon as I finish my coffee.
I feel really on the spot now.
I'm gonna call you back.
It's fine, but --
She is. I think, why did you come here like this?
Figures.
Fastball.
Jeanne, be patient.
No, Ernie's is fine.
Did he train you? Rehearse you? Teach you what to say and what to do?
Why? Since you'd tricked me so well up to then?!! You played his wife so well, Judy! He made you over, didn't he? Just as I've done. But better! Not just the hair and the clothes! the look! the manner! the words! Those beautiful phony trances! That jump into the Bay! I'll bet you're really a strong swimmer, aren't you! Aren't you!!
I thought this was a 45-minute seminar.
Ah, yes! I was a set-up. I was the made-to-order witness. Where is he now?
He's the only husband I've got. I tried to make it work, I really have -- but --
Why baseball?
You okay?
Annie, I think you should leave.
Don't tell me you didn't know it was loaded. Sylvie!
Isn't there something constructive he can do -- like start an avalanche?
Who?
Where is Stephanie?
What're you drinking?
Hey, there you are.
Yep.
If you can, send me a receipt.
Upstairs. Getting cleaned up.
What the fuck are you doing?
Where is the play?
Oh, that's not me. It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
Good evening, Baxter.
Yes, Mr. Kirkeby. You still owe me for the last two bottles --
I'll pay you on Friday. And whatever happened to those little cheese crackers you used to have around?
Oh. 'Bye, Doc.
Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
Hi, Doc. Had a late call?
Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
Well, I made the dean's list.
You mean you've known about him all along? Why didn't you tell me?
There's only one Dyle connected with this affair, Mrs. Lampert -- that's Carson.
Carson?
That's not Carson Dyle.
No, what?
I'm very sorry --
Mr. Bartholomew -- why didn't you tell me you knew about Dyle?
Well then don't pick it up. You know what's best.
God asked you to do something?
Why would they?
What signs?
No. That was a sword in a field.
Wait till the liquor wears off. Once they start getting headaches They'll lose interest.
Yes, but does everyone kill Bambi?
If they get set up in time, which I doubt. And even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little Latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a Ford.
Look I don't care about the money right now: I just want some sleep. So if you could be quiet -
Oh Jesus Christ.
I wanna hear about it, George.
I said sit down!
'Cause you're goin' to America!! Full house boys!
Goin' home... to the land o' the free and the home of the real hot- dogs! On the TITANIC!! We're ridin' in high style now! We're practically goddamned royalty, ragazzo mio!!
Hey, have 'em put me away, or whatever you're gonna do, okay?... I'm too tired to lie, I'm too tired to tell the truth... I'm too tired for anything.
I wanna hear about it.
There was one nice-looking one there inna black dress and beads, but she's dancing now.
There's a nice-looking little short one for you right now.
Not a bad crowd tonight, you know?
Nossir. I'd gone to tell the wid... to tell Mrs. Heine.
Yeah?
We? You and your parents killed your husband?
Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Lemme get this through this lame brain of mine. Are you suggesting we go out and hire someone to say he's gonna commit suicide on Christmas Eve? Is that it?
Who, for instance?
Very pretty. Very pretty, indeed, Miss Mitchell. But would you mind telling me who goes on Christmas Eve?
What John Doe?
Outrageous, Merv. Nice to be here. I feel great.
Seriously, Merv, everything is great. I was thinking about picking up some hash this weekend, maybe going up to the mountains.
I've been swimming, Merv.
"Discourteous insinuations about his sexual abilities." Who told you to say that?
Boss!
I was just about to make my point, Your Honor.
What else did the District Attorney's Office tell you to say?
Then -- those are not your own words?
I'm just curious to see if Mr. Troxell reconstructed anything else.
No, you said I should get my degree. I like my "bullshit" job, okay, and it's gonna lead to a spot in the front office. Til then, don't worry, there's just enough savings to keep your ass in Gucci and gold.
I'm thirty myself.
Does 'Flintstone' mean anything to you?
I don't know. This makes me feel funny.
I feel I ought to take care of her.
Why shouldn't I make Hildy my beneficiary? I've got nobody else to leave it to.
What have you got, Hildy?
That's good.
What about the other night. What about last night? Was that to get to know your character?
I don't know.
Why?
You paid 50,000 for your character?
It's just you need to give me the money...do you have it right now?
Whoa...whoa...wait, wait -- don't please....
How much money do you have in your pockets?
You made a phone call and you said you'd help a girl out and then you didn't....I'm here to get the money.
Wait a minute --
No, no, no, no c'mon man, don't make it a thing --
Please don't do this.
It's three hundred and twenty dollars, just take it.
What do you have in the house?
Soon you'll be able to take the Holy Mass, and as you eat of his flesh and drink of his blood, you will be at one with him.
That's why you come back, huh?
Tomorrow you come for some bird, right?
They d never let me go. And you d end up in more trouble than you know for helping me.
Well, yeah... you know.
Right, that's right.
Right.
Great.
They are?
He's gone sweetheart. He's gone!
...Sure.
Well, come to think of it, we did have a big event around here. Beth started talking.
You know I love you... yeah?
I'd like that.
We don't get to talk much any more.
You know what, Martin? I ought to tie you down with your old arse up in the air and advertise the hole in the middle of it to the world. Free. And hope you never die.
Let's get outta this stink.
So you still haven't said, how you wanna do it?
No.
...just talking to you....
....no....
Just a second, I'll be right with you...
Alright. Meet me at the Met.
Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
Yes, ma'am, At first. Then I was directly above him.
On his six.
Not in this case. CHARLIE You saw a MiG push negative 4G?
Yes, ma'am.
I was inverted.
Oh... Kinda the same way.
Really?
Ah, sweet college days. But you're the one who blew it. I'm still available. Available Ferguson. Say, Midge, do you remember a guy at college named Gavin Elster?
No, I am appalled that I have a reporter in there, undercover, for almost three weeks now- I had to read about this in the Tribune.
Almost.
Give men that. I know how to do it.
Boys like the one you met today are surplus. Commodities worth a handful of notes in whatever arsehole of the world they happen to be born into. We improve some lives buying them where they re not wanted, improve still more selling them where they are. Is that too hard for you?
So you killed him and went to clean out his hotel room... How did Friedman say he got to know where to find me?
I think you d rather not know what I think.
Not even scum like Friedman would go to the trouble of killing a stranger on the strength of one anonymous call.
Try again, and this time be polite.
This is the only thing you found?
Roger, no.
Look, you can't stay here. Just take your champagne and go.
Baxter, I don't want to pull rank on you -- but I told the lady it was all set -- you want to make a liar out of me?
Are you going to leave, Mr. Kirkeby, or do I have to throw you out?
Buddy-boy, why didn't you say so? You got yourself a little playmate, huh?
Now will you get out?
Say, why don't we have ourselves a party -- the four of us?
No!
No, wait... please... listen...
Oh no... Don't you understand?
I need your help. In order to fight Blackheart, I must wear the armor of Achilles. I --
I'm thinking ... I wish someone else had to make this decision. 50 thousand bucks is more than any other California toxic plaintiff has gotten. Ever. But ...
It's about 50 thousand per plaintiff.
Things like the head counsel for PG E calling me with an offer. 20 million, plus attorney's fees. Take it or leave it.
Well, I'm not coming, Barbie. So you guys have fun.
Ken.
I guess I just thought there was still some hope for us somewhere down the road and I just, I just --
You see, Vicki, I just heard about this today, you getting married that is, and I was kind of taken aback. Kind of hard to believe.
I'm just curious. Can't you give me an example?
Gazzo's gotta come to you.
Maybe another job is the best thing.
Yes.
'Lathrop Wells, please. I do not speak English.'
The car will stop?
On my mother's life.
You told her I never said I love you before?
Yes!
You told her that people are jealous cause I'm loaded?
See if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one.
He's safe.
I don't know much about him.
Goodnight to you, Susan.
Nobody's asking you to.
Near the church.
I sat outside and had coffee.
The war.
Any letters?
No, Doctor.
No -- letters to two-eighty.
If a young woman, a stenographer, -- etc.
Anyone asked for me?
Nobody, Doctor.
Telegrams?
No, Doctor.
A name?
I'll speak to you.
No. I'm doing fine...Look.
Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?
Oh.
Aw screw it...
Mayo, the rest of your class knows about candidate Worley, and we're all sorry.
I'm busy, Mayo. It'll have to wait.
Sir, this officer candidate requests permission to speak to you in private.
Mayo, you didn't hear me -- I said I I'm busy! And so are you! Go get cleaned up!
It's important, sir!
Not me, pal.
I know, I need a keeper.
Keep your eye on that brass ring. Don't let anything side-track you.
Come on, you...
So patience, Thibeau, patience. Trust me.
Yes, but I want to hear you tell it. Starting with when you tried to grab the wheel -- where was this?
You look like George Washington.
I cannot tell you a goddamned lie. She's selling you a pig in a poke. We better do this tonight.
No, they're a pain in the ass, there's no way of keeping track of anything. It's a cash business and you've got to watch your operators or they'll steal you blind, am I right or am I right?
Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time?
I don't need any help.
What is this interest you've got in her?
He video taped you.
Why?
It's very good -- because when the D.A's office saw it they assumed it was the end of the tape, otherwise they would have buried it.
Because it hasn't all been erased.
Sounds like a two weeks' notice to me.
Huh?
I've got one for Cobb
"There once was a man named Cobb, Who kept Semple away from the mob. Came the turn of the tide And Semple - he died - And now poor Cobb's out of a job!"
Oh, that's different if it's just poetry.
Are you a married man, Mr. Deeds?
I've gotten the 'sackaroo' in many ways - but never in rhyme.
Who - me? No.
Why? So he'll learn to fear punishment, rather than pursue virtue for its own reward?
I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
It s a glimpse, Jacko.
Brought what on myself?! I didn t do anything!
Look, I don t know what you re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
You mean because you thought I was cocky I m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
No? C mon, Jack...I ve got everything I need, I don t have regrets, that s just not for me... sound familiar?
Give me my goddamn life back!
Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you. You re making a business deal...
Please. Just tell me what s happening to me. In plain English. None of that mumbo jumbo...
You? What about me? I m working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
Dickhead?
Where are we going?
Say,...did you just lose your job because of me?
No, I'm lost.
So I get the brownie?
Takin' over this local, you know it took a little doin'. Some pretty tough fellas were in the way. They left me this to remember them by.
When he got up and chased them they thought it was a dead man coming after them.
I know what's eatin' you, kid. But I got two thousand dues-payin' members in my local that's seventy-two thousand a year legitimate and when each one of 'em puts in a couple of bucks a day to make sure they work steady well, you figure it out. And that's just for openers. We got the fattest piers in the fattest harbor in the world. Everything that moves in and out we take our cut.
What gives with our boy tonight, Charley? He ain't himself.
The Joey Doyle thing. You know how he is. Things like that he exaggerates them. Too much Marquis of Queensbury. It softens 'em up.
Listen kid, I'm a soft tough too. Ask any rummy on the dock if I'm not good for a fin any time they put the arm on me. But my old lady raised us ten kids on a stinkin' watchman's pension. When I was sixteen I had to beg for work in the hold. I didn't work my way up out of there for nuthin'.
I know, Johnny, I know... .
We ain't robbin' pennies from beggars. We cuttin' ourselves in for five-six million a year just on our half a dozen piers a drop in the bucket compared to the traffic in the harbor. But a mighty sweet little drop, eh, Charley?
It'll do.
... 'Cause of being woken up, and it would make my job impossible. So then I wouldn't even try.
Were you asleep?
What a break...
I had to see you...
Lesson number two. Never work for your former spouse.
Charenton is my life's work. To have her wrested from beneath me now --
Come here.
Candaules
Daskylus
I tried to tell myself it was for the best, that there was a reason behind it. But... Del?
I'm not laughing at you. Go on, please.
So what makes you so sensitive?
What do you read? What's the last book you read?
Yeah, well, I saw the movie. That must mean I'm sensitive too.
I don't know. Why do you keep calling me George?
I'm not everybody.
What're we having?
My special, scrambled eggs surprise.
That's what everybody says.
Shit! A Nursemaid! My first detail, and I'm a fuckin' slug! I got a 'choice' at all.
Why not Patrol? They'd do just as good a job.
You in this with me?
Yes, Bill.
When they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. Other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, I still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. So, I ask you again, Mr. McClusky, what's changed?
Mickey and Mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. I'm confused. What's changed?
Why are Mickey and Mallory being moved to an asylum? And who made the decision?
Never mind, son. She doesn't want it.
I said, do you want some water?
It's weird. I actually feel good about myself. Can we do this again next week?
What?
Yes, both of 'em! But don't let him out of your sight.
Is this Friedman?
Hi.
Okay, fellows.
I brought the money, Monsieur Blaine.
I figured you could pick up your car tomorrow.
You better not fuck this up. I'm heavily invested.
Only the agency of servants.
I'd love for him to get a good education. That's it.
Hell, I've just been going over the whole thing in my head and -
Nellie Fox. Walter likes the past. And he likes the little guys.
I'd give five years of my life to see the old country again, the greenfields, and the river, and the old round tower, and the burying place.

Harold, who ran away with his secretary but came back --
And your brother Tom is a psychology professor and is married to...Betsy --
Your Uncle Milton lost all his money in a Puerto Rican condominium that went belly up, don't mention the IRS or the Federal prison system. Your mother is Barbara, your father is Cliff --
Am I what they had in mind?
They lost their son. Why?
But I'm wild at heart.
I'm not here to make you feel bad. I'm here for vindication. In my heart...
In Portugal, yes.
Yeah. And it might have even worked too.
You look exactly the same.
She said alone -- suite 405. It ain't gonna take long.
Where the hell you goin'?
I'm going with you.
You always say that. You always say that. I'm telling you, you never met the man.
Well...
By a strange coincidence, I was thinking of you.
Yeah. I was just wondering what makes dames like you so dizzy.
Boy, that looks tasty. What is that?
Gazzo's gotta come to you -- Hey, Paulie, it's a bad job -- Do what you do now.
Gotta wait til the press conference.
I don't understa--
I don't know. But if this is a sample of American diplomacy I'm buying a fallout shelter.
The American Embassy.
Well, I d sooner mug an old lady...
A small loan would be welcome. More urgently, I need access to a telephone and an address where things can be sent to me.
A word of advice my celibate friend. These Czech girls look like dynamite and go like it, but don't be fooled; there's a price to be paid and it's going up fast. Right Kat?
Just because they've got a choice of four McDonalds, doesn't mean they can afford a cheeseburger.
You're everything a guy could want.
Her family? Oh, they'll be all right. I'll bring them around. Gilded cage?! Besides, I'm not marrying her family. Stew Smith in a gilded cage! Stew Smith? Ha! That mug. What does he know?
What about, tonight?
Yes, sir -- I understand. She left a note -- you want me to open it and read it to you? Well, it was just a suggestion -- no, you don't have to worry about that, Mr. Sheldrake -- I kept your name out of it so there'll be no trouble, police-wise or newspaper- wise --
These guys make top-notch Pinot and Chardonnay. One of the best producers in Santa Barbara county. Look how beautiful this view is. What a day!
You're not making sense, Baxter. What's this all about?
... this doing hair it's...
I didn't want to tell you over the phone but that certain party -- you know who I mean -- I found her here last night -- she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills.
Oh, I bet some little guy comes in here at night and pushes it. Go- go-go!
They're still there!
I'm here.
He has a knife.
I just don't want trouble.
No. In the morning.
Jim--Do you think when the end of the world comes it'll be at night?
I don't know yet. I want to hear what she says at her statement tomorrow.
Yeah -- but can she cook?
Humped
You're not gonna be there.
I know. We're having a meeting, it's all set up --
My name's Beefy. I'm an old friend of your father's. He's asked me to help you out.
No.
You. Mouth closed.
I know. I don't either.
I'll report it to the driver. About your bag, I mean.
Do you understand?
I couldn't go through with it. Remarkable.
I wanted money desperately -- Can you understand? -- That's why I wanted the pearls. I was threatened -- I was desperately in need of a certain big sum of money. I've been following you -- I've admired you. But I have forced myself not to think about you -- Last night, at last, I managed to came into your room and -- and now.
Yesterday I was a thief -- but now, --
I know.
Just trying to have fun. That fucking prison is really starting to get to me. C'mon, Seeger. Gimme a push. Fuck you guys! I'll do it myself!
Yes?
Tell them the gear is down and we're ready to land.
Make it official, if you like.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions? Unofficially, of course.
I'm a drunkard.
What is your nationality?
I was born in New York City if that'll help you any.
That makes Rick a citizen of the world.
There seems to be no secret about that.
I understand you came here from Paris at the time of the occupation.
Are you one of those people who cannot imagine the Germans in their beloved Paris?
Do you miss it?
And did you?
Well, let's just call it a compliment and move on. Did you love teaching?
That's a public course. No Stephanie?
That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and vice versa. But us -- you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you are. That's Romance!
Anyone know how to release the lines on this crate?
Sure, I can't last forever. I want a son I can train to take my place on this paper.
Where do you find the time? Where do you find the energy. It's tough enough to keep your mind on school. A woman here is a real pain in the...
You're glowing again.
All right, I take it back.
Food...and you...my F-14!
I do not.
Pardon?
Very well.
You have to rise above it. The professionals rise above that kind of thing...
Well, no one ever spit in my face before. Especially some cracker fuck.
What the hell was that, another statement?
Wait. Any last words, General Lee?
Should I kill him now?
He's telling the truth. He doesn't know.
Andy, it's not so easy. There are hundreds of kilometers of tunnels under Paris. It's a whole other city, crawling with drug addicts, lunatics, skinheads... It's no man's land.
I can't believe this. Why don't you go down in the tunnels and find the goddamn... animals that attacked my uncle?
Maybe we should go now. You must be very tired. We'll call if any new -
Yeah, well, these fleas must have teeth like fuckin' chain saws.
Well, here's what I think happened. A chemistry professor goes to a bad part of town late at night. Why? Perhaps he's making a few francs on the side. The psychedelic drug market is big these days. He gets mixed up with a bad crowd and, like they say, if you lie with dogs, you get fleas.
What do you mean, maniacs?
Vegetable, right. My mistake. It seems he was attacked by a maniac, maybe two or three maniacs, just after midnight. yesterday. They fled into the tunnels beneath Paris, that's all we know...
Legume? You mean, a vegetable?
Won't you see me later?
Your uncle was carrying this. The keys to his apartment are in there. I talked to his assistant, Madame Flocquet. You'll be staying there a while?
No, that's okay, I'll do It now.
But aren't you...
Where's your car?
Jill says nothing.
Who?
Don't say that.
Of course they're going to stay. She's got some fresh orange layer cake. You know, with the thick stuff on the top? Sure, they don't want to go to the hotel.
He was? Gee, that's too bad. If there's anything I can do to
Well, he passed on. He was killed in a motor accident in Italy.
Not much. He's an uncle of mine, I think. I never saw him, but my mother's name was Semple, you know.
Mr. Deeds, does the name of Martin W. Semple mean anything to you?
Why, no.
Oh, yes, I heard you all right. 20,000,000. That's quite a lot, isn't it?
Perhaps you didn't hear what I said, Mr. Deeds! The whole Semple fortune goes to you! 20,000,000!
Hey, watch out! Guess you want a house full of pickaninnies too, huh?
No. No mistake Pete. It doesn't prove who it was -- but proves it wasn't Tom.
Not Tom. Whoever it was left a kind of souvenir, I told you, in her clothing. Semen. The laboratory got a blood group reading from that. The man was blood type 0; Tom was an AB.
How'd ya like hearin' ya name on TV?
Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
Driver!
You win!
Now, listen. I'm in a very ugly mood. I put up a stiff battle for that seat. So if it's just the same to you scram.
Am I?
I'm worried about you, man. You better learn to have a pop once in a while or you're gonna fall off the wagon. You're being a fanatic and that ain't healthy.
Jesus, you know what? This shit doesn't even taste good to me anymore.
Bet your ass you are. Now I don't want to hear anymore of your happy horseshit. You gotta learn how to bend a little or believe me... you're gonna break.
This is a light beer. You can't have a light beer?
Healy, what I just tell you?
No I can't.
Charge it.
Ah, fuck ya then, you big pussy. What are you, spotting?
I don't know! I just said that!
I don't know what to do! I don't know what to do! Crap. Crap...
No way. I can handle this.
Shit!
Not funny, huh?
I'll tell you that joke again. A man comes into a restaurant. Did you get that?
So you don't think that's funny? It is funny! Everyone else thinks so! Maybe you didn't get it.
It seemed funny to me when I first heard it. Maybe the trouble isn't with the joke. Maybe it's with you!
I must be goin' deaf 'cause I thought ya said, 'ten cents.'
Maybe you haven't any sense of humor. Well, I'll give you one more chance! Now listen!
You want to know how much I got tied up in deposits with Willie? We're in for three weeks solid, Jack.
Cancel, Frank.
Better give her pneumonia.
Right back to California. We've got to go home and rest up from our vacation.
Why didn't you just go along with Townsend. Get rid of me. I would've...
Yeah with all the trimmings. Now, how about the check. Do I get it?
Yes... of course... when you don't need me anymore.
She grabbed herself a perfect running mate. King Westley! The pill of the century! What she needs is a guy that'd take a sock at her every day whether it's coming to her or not.
Oh, no, no, no. It, uh, it-it-it- it was i-inevitable that Hannah and I part, anyway.
Hannah and I are in the last stages.
I know! I-I-I-I, I realize.
Oh, no, no. Well, yes! I love you.
Wh--, it-it-it-it, it's so sad. She's crazy about me, but somewhere on the, along the line, I've fallen out of love with her.
If anyone orders Merlot, I'm leaving. I am not drinking any fucking Merlot!
Well of course I'd want to give her that. I mean, what do you think, I don't care about her?
Of course.
Well...I'm pretty sure I've --
But that one time --
I -- I don't know, you can't ask me that.
America's bored. Now, what do you want?
Yeah, it's the highlight of my day.
If...?
A girl after your own heart, Ted.
Good fact. Well, you let me know.
Getting nervous?
You'll answer my questions?
Weird dreams? You're going to tell me about them?
You don't understand. He wants all the money that is in your bank.
I've got eight hundred pounds. Oh Jesus.
He wants the money from your bank.
I'll fuckin' give it to him! We'll go down there.
He wants a lot of money.
I'll give him money. Tell him to put the...
He wants money.
Tell him to put the kettle down and I'll give him money.
He says you are very sad ridiculous man. I don't agree of course. And that you must pay someone to have sex like a prostitute. Nadia is a prostitute. I'm sorry.
What does he want. The Russian shithead. What do you want ?
Hey Chris, keep an eye on things.
Interesting. Do reckon I could fit through here?
Okay, whatever. Come on Chris!
Get a tray for these great big important simoleons.
Isabelle? I need to talk to Kim...
Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
We'll save them for seed. A toast!
At thy good heart's oppression.
Farewell, my cuz.
I'm just tired. Please put her on? Thanks.
I won't be making the trip.
Who?
Ah. The mating call of the blonde. The night is young, the moon is bright, whataya feel like doing tonight?
Don't, Beth. Don't lie to me.
It's Internal Affairs, isn't it?
You can't just "borrow" my car for a couple of months! That's like ten years in Bambi life!
What's wrong with you? We need your help.
No. I'm missing the game for you.
Sorry, coach.
I'm not playing.
Jill, say hello to Felicia.
What kind of treatment?
Jesus, I don't know, baby, I been cutting too much hair lately. I'm losing all my concepts...
Hey, baby, what's happening?
Great.
I'm having a blast. God, that sucker teed off on it just like he knew I was gonna throw a fastball.
Awright, meat, give him your heat.
How?
He did know.
Another 'you'?
Don't worry.
Now, remember -- keep it simple.
Ouch!!
He said he would be there with bells on.
Unfortunately. I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo benefit -- it was better than Seconal.
But what about the noise from the car. What if --
Right. That s a major oversight... So if I m Kate...I can t really afford the finer things, my husband s career is a crushing disappointment to me, I m trapped in suburbia...
Maybe there s a jewelry store back at the mall. I could get her a pair of earrings or something.
Don t you think that s a little gimmicky?
Take it easy.
How come you stay 'round here?
We're talking.
I said: Cut it out!
Say, who's putting up this dough?
I don't mind --
I know
Oh. Of course... sorry.
Right... I was. I was an idiot, plain and simple, and I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. How's that?
I have... did it sound that bad?
I mean, I haven't even told anyone I've met you. Who would even know to do this?
Come on, now -- if you wanted to hide something, where would you put it?
Dom? What are you?
Hello, Mr. Gayle. I'm Phil Wurlitzer. We talked on the phone. It's a pleasure to meet you.
Okay, guys, we're here. L.A. County Jail. Julie, just park in the front.
Roger, I'm starting to get pissed. Just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.
Roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? It's important we establish a rapport. Something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.
Am I going? Am I going to England? I've thought about this quite a bit, and I've realised what I probably should do is just carve out a goal for my future and find out what I wanna do with my life, do all the stuff that I've been avoiding in a big way. I mean, Diane and I can wait for each other, right? What's she gonna... she's gonna run off with some English guy? There's no way.
Well Lloyd, I admire you for not hitching a ride. You know, my daughter's a lot different to you.
Uh, yeah. Sure. Honey, did you forget the guys are coming over tonight?
Kate, you're still there? I thought you'd be on your way home by now.
I know.
She's very successful.
Well, then, w-who was?
Well no...inverse order.
What?
Is your family in the apple business, too?
I never seen anybody so in love like Cosmo back then! He'd stand outside the house all day and look in the windows. I never told you this cause it's not really a story. But one time I woke up in the middle of the night cause this bright light was in my face. Like a flashlight. I couldn't think a what it was. I looked out the window, and it was the moon! Big as a house! I never seen the moon so big before or since. I was almost scared, like it was gonna crush the house. And I looked down, and standing there in the street was Cosmo, looking up at the windows. This is the funny part. I got mad at you, Cosmo! I thought you brought this big moon over to my house cause you were so in love and woke me up with it. I was half asleep I guess and didn't know no better.
I hope I don't find any little hairy things living up here -- wait! There is something! If I can just -- yes, I'm getting it -- a case of some sort -- it's heavy.
Rose, pass the wine.
... yeah, that.
Anything.
I always wanted to fly... ever since I first saw a jet. I wanted to fly jets, then I wanted F-14's, then I wanted to fly off carriers, then I wanted Top Gun.
You want to go ballistic?
I don't know yet.
And now I want you.
Are you totally insane?!
Please, Nicky, get back up there. Try to hurry.
That's a train, son. Don't stand in front of them.
I got hit by a big light that was attached to a lot of metal.
Son, just do your best.
Really. I want to know.
Oh no. In the car you did it?
I'm curious.
Do you remember the make of the car?
What kind of car was it?
Let us not discuss this further. I am very pleased....
No. To the pain.
Well, what about the Building and Loan?
Would I? You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is me, you remember me? George Bailey.
High tech. I like the sound of that.
We'll go into that some other time.
Listen, did anybody ever make a sucker out of you? This is a matter of principle. Something you probably wouldn't understand. When somebody takes me for a buggy ride I don't like the idea of having to pay for the privilege.
A guy that'd fall in love with your daughter should have his head examined.
Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her.
Disappointed?
Thank you!
It's true.
Not with the wine list these people have. We don't want to hold back.
We should have driven.
Wow. This must be big.
Are you a warrior?
How?
I'll pay you back.
You might find a bullet through that head...
I have an idea working in my head...
If you did that, you'd get nothing except the police after you. If you wait -- I'll give you your six thousand back --
What's that? I hear something!
Then you're not married -- if you didn't say it, you didn't do it -- wouldn't you agree, Your Highness?
Just a minute!
Hey Jack, hurry up!
I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
Only this far.
Now? Why not tomorrow? After the show.
Why? What's happened?
I love those doors.
The garage.
I'll be by Saturday to pick him up.
Not for the weekend. For the summer.
I could do that. In fact, I've got some rope up here. But I do not think that you will accept my help, since I am only waiting around to kill you.
What the hell was that all about?
Beware the moon?
I don't know. Let's see if there's an inn or something up the road.
I am trying to keep emotions out of this. Even though this is an important issue to me and I have strong feelings about the subject.
This is not a sexist thing. If you were a waiter I would still be here saying...
I'm hungry. You've upset my whole day. I haven't eaten.
Yes, I do, as a matter of fact... and to prove it I have not gotten personal and you have. Why aren't you at work? You're not sick -- you don't look sick... just very tired and bitter.
You were always friendly to me. I appreciated that. You know, this used to be a fantasy of mine.
I'm following you and David, if you-
I was getting hot dogs. What do you mean?
Leave? Just a few million years ago every atom in this hair--in our bodies--was a part of a star. I don't see it as leaving. I see it as going home.
God, you're serious, aren't you?
It isn't?
You really need that much?
More than that. You'll get used to it.
God, what wouldn't you do to leave the planet?
Wrong color. It's silver. It's not easy living up to this.
You had to be a right-hander.
Noone orders southpaws anymore.
I won't. Now run. Fast as you can!
Find Fergie, check the barns. I'll watch these two.
It's them, Sam. Now, Sam, listen to me and listen to me carefully. Listen to me as you never listened before.
Is it them?
Listen to me, Sam! I want you to go across the new corn to Stoltzfus'. Run as fast as you can. And stay there!
Are they going to kill you?
I'll be all right. You just do as I say.
What are you going to do?
How will I know what she requires?
No.
Who?
So what ' s up with your dad? He a pain in the ass?
I'm gettin' there
You don't strike me as the type that would ask permission.
Fan out and look for them.
He and Debbie stand outside the theater, which is a multi-plex cinema. Fourteen movie theaters under one roof. Prominent is a sign which reads: "24 HOUR 3D FESTIVAL!" Cole drags Debbie into one of the theaters. The gang runs up to the theaters.
I don't know what I'm supposed say, Mary. I want to do the right thing here.
It was a mutual decision.
I think goodbye is traditional.
-- this is a fairly strange reality to be faced with. To be honest, I don't realize...
Look... you do well for people, they don't ask you to stop. Nobody wants you to stop making money, doll, not even Uncle Sam. They all want their share.
...but who cares? It was just-- It was fabulous.
Yes--you know what I've been thinking, Sally?--
Easy kid--easy.... Come on--I want to talk to you.
You said it! Here's looking at you, kid.
Looking for a job.
You look all right. You want to pick it up a little?
Feel good?
Well, he don't know that. Just sit the horse. Good... You have a nice seat.
What about you? Why are you here?
My wife needs space, I don't know my kids ' birthdays. Everyone wants Tiger Woods, but they could get me, so I'm here doing a whiskey commercial.
So you empowered Bob Sugar to deal with Denver behind my back?
I brought Denver to twenty million. Denver deals with me all the time. You listened to Sugar? You let that snake in the door.
I from dat nex' place.
No, no. I on holiday.
I nuttin' to do wi' dat.
Doctor lady make it irey.
Can't, sistah.
Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
I assigned you Bingham and Washington to go along.
They're real Goddamn good. They'll be there for when ya need 'em. Where are they?
How 'bout Mallory?
Me, neither. I don't eat meat.
I thought it was wonder-- There's maybe one or two things in there that I would do differently myself, but...
I'm afraid not -- I usually do just what I feel like doing at the moment.
Nothing -- only to be here.
But surely you must know -- because I love you.
Don't cry -- it tears my heart to see you sob like that.
I just can't look at you the same way.
Me?
It's Fate, Hildy. What will be, will be.
Was she? Did you notice?
Now everything's fine. She's probably squawking her head off in some police station.
Butter-fingers! I give you an old lady to take somewhere, and you hand her over to the cops!
Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.
I can't, I have no idea how he's doing it. And that leaves you trailing, Jim. You gotta get your act together.
Did you see the reviews?
She's not available.
I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
Okay, explain.
Oh, you're more than okay.
Excuse me. Snoopy? Did we settle the fish thing?
We'll talk about it in the car.
Yeah. We'll do it right now. On the way to Lester's house.
I'll meet you on the turnpike.
Okay. Maybe tomorrow.
When's school over?
Yeah. The deep South.
You're goddamn right I am.
And if you think I come here for any reason besides pure boredom, then you're all wrong.
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time with a broken-down alcoholic!
Well, I'm not.
You go to hell. You go straight to hell, Mrs. Robinson. Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm proud of this?
You're a good girl.
What's between you and her is between you and her. But here's what's between you and me. Everybody has a hero, Danny. And you're mine.
Maybe just trying to measure up.
Bullshit. We've played with each other, pushed each other. This is different. Like you want to prove that you're better than me. Who's that for -- Evelyn?
I'll be in the bedroom.
Can you keep Sam straight?
I mean drugs. I thought you said he was?
Belinda's a very jealous person.
No. I mean yes.
Come on, I'm freezing.
Where the devil should this Romeo be? Came he not home to-night?
What...?
I can't.
If you or any of your lunatic friends ever come near me again...
That's right.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah? Terrific.
Right. Tsch, well, I have to-I have t-o go now, Duane, because I-I'm due back on the planet earth.
Oh, hi, Duane, how's it goin'?
Mimi? ... Oh, Dorothy's mother. Does she have to be up to something?
At my house...!
It's Venza. He wants you. You, for Ellie and Tommy.
Koontz! I need you guys!
No, I need'm now!
You expect me to believe that?
Think I got 'em?
You do?
No! Don't touch it! I want the world to see my shame.
NOW STRIP.
DEATH!!
Very well, m'sieu.
Dude, know your art form. If you put the camera down here, looking up, I look more powerful. There's no need for a camel... you got ME.
It's all over, Paul.
Really? Very, very?
No. Josie, this is real.
And you will be out by tomorrow morning.
You have enjoyed the confidence of this family for more than forty years. You must be a man of about-- about sixty-five. Let's see-- You will be exactly eighty-seven when you come out of prison.
What is it?
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! What's the matter with you, man? SHUT UP!
Hey, asshole! That's not cool!
Throw me his ball.
You're right, I don't understand. Explain it to me. You were scared. Arlyn Page, that scared you. Well it should; that's death. So what did you do, you ran straight for it, death. Ligourin kills women.
What is it?
Can I do anything?
"Somebody's Gonna Die" by Blitz. "Bella Lugosi's Dead," Bauhaus. It's got that creepy Halloween feeling.
"Abraham, Martin, and John." That's a nice one.
Me?
Do you want me to be there?
I might ask you the same question.
Yes. They paid your ransom... tomorrow you will be transferred to their great castle at Rouen.
It seems that the English care more about you than the French.
Well I ought to know my own mind And I'm tellin' you what suits me Is a family and kids. That suits Me right down to the ground. In Fact, that's my idea of heaven. All right, what's your idea of heaven?
How would you know?
I don't know, make some money, Have some kids, you know.
Where do you get these questions?
That's just what she said. I had a boner with a capital "O." I went to kiss her but she broke off laughin' and ran down the hallway. I found her lyin' on a bed in a room filled with assault weapons and Penthouse magazines. She was a wild chick. She was wearin' bright orange pants with kind of Spanish lookin' lacy black stripes down the sides. You know, them kind that doesn't go all the way down your leg?
Told her my name. Then she said somethin' like, 'It's so noisy down here. Why don't we go upstairs so we can hear ourselves?' She turned around and led the way. I knew I had an important lesson to learn that day.
When she got almost to the top step I stuck my hand between her legs from behind.
She looked right at me and run her tongue over her lips and put her hand on my arm - told me her name was Irma.
Maybe two, three months after Juarez. I was visitin' my cousin, Junior Train, in Savannah, and we were at some kid's house whose parents were out of town. A girl comes up to me that was real tall, taller than me.
You found three batteries, you say. A D-6 and D-8 in the well. And a spare D-8 on the cabin floor. Correct?
You have to wonder.
Oh yeah? Me, too.
That's all Dr. Paley.
...What?
Tommy, before you go, I wonder if you gimme a little advice.
Tremoille, I'm not even king yet... who'd want to assassinate me?
My astrologers assure me that the hour is p-p-propitious -- Leo, with Virgo rising. Have you ever noticed on the astrological chart how the Virgin is next to the Lion?
You wouldn't do a thing like that, would you?
Really? Some high class gold digger who speaks French better than I do? No, thank you. I just got off the phone with one.
I'll put one on the notice-board too.
No bother.
Hey, Lawrence how are you doing mate?
I've been around.
No! Look Lawrence, I've taken over the lease on a theatre downtown and I'm throwing a party tomorrow night to show it off. It's going to be for alternative arts, but I need some help to finish it off, can you put the word out?
Here's the details.
Now listen, Jackie, I'm not jealous of anybody, I just can't afford to get caught... off base.
How 'bout that furniture plant?
Of course not.
I love you.
It must have been some other gate.
Not against Castle Dugan gate, that has been off the hinges these ten years.
But swords are today impossible; Captain Best is -- is lame. He knocked his knee against the swinging park gate last night, as he was riding home, and can scarce move it now.
I'll match any man with the sword.
I'll tell him when he comes in.
Rick, I'll put my cards on the table. I think you know where those letters are.
Well, you're in good company. Renault and Strasser probably think so, too.
That's why I came over here to give them a chance to ransack my place.
Rick, don't be a fool. Take me into your confidence. You need a partner.
Good morning.
Signor Ferrari is the fat gent at the table.
Really?
I am relaxing.
Those 'dirty looks'. Defendant ever aim one of those at you?
I don't know, he's got an awful lot on his mind right now.
Nobody talks to children! They just tell them one thing and mean another.
Then we'll keep driving...you'll decide.
It's wonderful that you understand so well--and so young too! You know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?
I got some hair stuff.
That's ok.
No, what are you talking about.
What're you talkin' about?
You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making...
If the Preysing people get the Manchester contract, we shall certainly merge with the Preysing company -- but if they haven't they're ruined -- Preysing will have to declare himself.
And ask me what it's costing us to hammer it down.
Maybe he just travels in bad company.
WHAT!
I don't care what it says! Maybe Mama was delirious, you know. She didn't know what she was saying. If she wanted to be cremated, why the hell did she let dad buy two plots, huh?
How is your mother-in-law?
And her farmhouse...?
Yeah.
And as I said, sir, we can't very well exert physical persuasion upon the sacred vessel Malkovich.
She left me.
Leave it, Ann.
What is your name?
Find out who wrote those newspaper articles and subpoena them right away.
Right... OK...
Charlie, we're off! Papers all set?
Want a drink? Great nap. Wanna go out tonight?
Farmer?
It needs work.
Thank God you were here.
Lois, I usually do.
Lois, what are you doing?
Not everyone can have X-ray vision, you know.
Uh. . .
Yeah, I can't beat him.
I been watchin' the movies -- studyin' -- He ain't weak nowhere.
Thanks be to God.
Good day, sir. I trust my honorable Duke of Burgundy is feeling well?
Very generous of you all. How much?
In that case, I suppose we can't charge.
But you think about Him -- It -- Her.
Yeah.
Like in a church painting. I see this giant hovering over the ground. He's wearing a robe, and has long flowing hair, and he's pointing his finger at something.
Yeah. He says that I will become a monster in two days. What do you think?
There is no point. You live. You die. The end.
I'll let you know the next full moon.
My friend Jack was just here.
All right, run 'em off.
It appears he missed an excellent Chance to keep his mouth shut.
I see you.
She had beautiful hands.
No, no! Just with her hands.
Yup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off.
Yeah, I know it's sick, but it's new. You know, you didn't say it couldn't be sick.
How can you say that? I mean, who said I-I-I-I said that you, I and that girl from your acting class should sleep together in a threesome.
Oh, I'm sure it's a lot of fun, 'cause the Incas did it, you know, and-and they-they-they were a million laughs.
Thanks a lot, Daddy. You really came through for me.
Well, son, I want you to know I hope everything works out with you and Alabama. I like her. I think you make a cute couple.
Keep it.
We're not as bad as you think, Rob.
Sonic Death Monkey.
What do you think? Dick likes it.
I just gotta talk to her, T.J.
How's the chicken?
I owe it to myself to go right to the edge, Rob, and this group does exactly that. Over the edge, in fact.
No. Thanks.
You'll be going over the fucking edge if you come anywhere near me next Friday night.
Look!
Now, Jackie --
Next week?
Yeah. Or the week after.
You make any sandwiches?
My first day of school, mother'd make me eat and by golly I could never even swallow till recess--
Thank you, Quince.
Mother--
Oh please Annette. You spend all your time preaching about waiting for love. Well here it is. Right in front of you, but you're going to turn your back on it. I'm sorry that we're not at the age where we can get married. If we were, I'd propose, but that's not going to happen. So I guess we're just fucked. I'll move on, but you... you're going to have to live with yourself knowing you've turned your back on love. And that makes you a hypocrite.
Get off me.
I love you so much.
But I gotta go now. I've got to go be Johnny.
Then I will go with you.
I know how to fight!
Joe, you don't know how glad I am you're aboard. Anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, I'm in his corner.
The firm took in sixty. That's three percent. Seemed like a fair bonus to me.
Take it.
"I can always find someplace else to work. Someplace that'll pay me a fortune and give me a view of the French Riviera ..."
Good. So did I.
Got it.
Um... did you still want to read my novel?
They want you to stand for Sheriff next election.
Start a band?
That's fine, but I don't want you to talk to Miller alone.
She's mine!
In the corporate offices.
Cole, what the hell are you doing?
Yes I do.
Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
Give me the fucking letter.
You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
What? Another letter from your friend?
I have a family, Mary.
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
What are you doing?
I was honest with you. I told you who I was.
Well, why is that up to me? You're the one who's married. You told me you have no intention of leaving your husband.
Routine! I don't have a routine. And if you think that's what this is -
Boy, Maude. The way you handle cars. I'd never handle a car like that.
How do you know what I experience?
No, it could take me hours. You know what it's like trying to find things in this town, not to mention disposable stuff - I wouldn't think they've ever heard of them.
You get the wine and I'll go see if I can rustle up some plastic cups.
Not on the opening night, wouldn't look right.
Here, let's both put in two hundred crowns. That should get nine or ten bottles of wine.
No, I figure once they see the place and we get'em a little drunk, they'll all want to help. We should have that floor done in a day or so.
We'd better get some booze in for tonight.
Sure, I think it s your turn to buy too.
I'll wait for you till seven.
Call me Les.
Not a word. He was going to check on the railroad station, and the trunk. He must be still on it.
Something on your mind, Lisa?
These antidote filters the Professor's whipped up will let you to see them like I have since yesterday, as arachtoidal creatures. They won't be pretty, nothing personal, John Parker. But just remember...if we fail tonight, there's no tomorrow.
Penny--?! Are you all right?
Lisa -- I can't guess what you're thinking.
You're an hour and a half late.
Who -- that guy at the Zoo?
Why don't I just drag you off? All right -- I will. Right after we get the blood tests.
Carl who?
I'd cut it...
Yeah, I think so...
What's that?
And me.
Hey, Rat.
I'm not.
No.
Yes.
Because I knew you'd think exactly what you're thinking.
It's merely a suggestion. I don't wish to press the point, Mr. Deeds, but if you'll give me your Power of Attorney we'll take care of everything. It'll save you a lot of petty annoyances. Every shark in town will be trying to sell you something.
Have you seen the papers?
Now you're talking, Babe. I'll keep the whole front page open. What are you going to do?
Uh-huh.
With pay!
What's going on, Bandit? Come on.
Damn, you are the real thing...
I call all you white guys "Jack."
How'd you know my name was Jack?
Yes you do...
No.
Like I said, it's a business deal...
Look, I'm talking about a business deal here. I buy the ticket for two hundred, take it to a store where the guy behind the counter... ...doesn't have a death wish ...I just made myself a quick thirty eight dollars.
There's no way I was gonna die in that deli... Let's just say I've been on a lucky streak lately.
You know you seem pretty relaxed for a guy who just had a gun pulled on him.
Can't you please just talk to me for one second?
Wait, Eve, please! Wait.
I haven't brushed yet.
Troy? Is he your husband? Or a boyfriend?
Oh what can I say Phil, it's just that I feel so welcome here.
Doctor Helburn, what a surprise. In the last couple of days we've changed your oil, realigned your brakes, balanced and rotated your tires, aligned your front end, and flushed out your entire cooling system, I really didn't expect to be seeing you for another three thousand miles.
Hungarian. Famous for their beautiful music...and beautiful women.
All right, so you don't like jewelry but...eh...you do like...eh...good music. Liszt, one of my favorites.
Where I come from, involvement...generally calls for a substantial piece of jewelry.
Sort of?
I think we'll live in Europe after we're married?
It was April. April seventeenth. That one I remember.
She was staying at the Grand downtown ...
In case of what?
Are you kidding? The Golden Globe, The Edward R. Murrow award...
'Every week by forty million people. I am a respected journalist.' Have you won any awards?
Where are we?
No, I don't really mean it. Well, I mean, this is our last chance to think about it. How 'bout you, Bama?
On average forty million.
That's what I thought. You tell them that. When we go down those stairs, I want you to scream what you just told me. 'My name is Wayne Gayle! I am the star of American Maniacs watched every week by'-- how many people?
Finsbury Park. We re in Finsbury Park.
Yeah. No. It's ok. What's goin' on?
Where are the kids?
What kids?
Of course not. But it was emotional. A friend's plea set against his mother's attitude.
You didn't?--I guess I forgot to tell you--
This sort of takes the sting out of being occupied, doesn't it, Mr. Richard?
What company?
Yeah. It's pretty bad timing. Where were you, say, ten years ago?
Thank you.
There have been cases... but the headache the next morning is worth while -- if you drink it with the right toast. To us, Ninotchka!
I didn't think she was so bad-looking.
You know so much about me -- figure it out.
I'm going to work.
No, no -- just had a little accident.
On account of me.
Yes.
Why do you think?
I do, Jill.
Am I hallucinating here? Just what in the hell do you think you're doing?
The country across the sea. The sworn enemy of Florin. Go!
Who's Guilder?
You never said anything about killing anyone.
Once the horse reaches the castle, the fabric will make the Prince suspect the Guilderians have abducted his love. When he finds her body dead on the Guilder frontier, his suspicions will be totally confirmed.
Who was that?... Who know's your here?
This ain't news, sweetheart. I hate to tell ya.
Uh-huh. You recall, did it say dead or alive?
I got your message... But you went right to Johnnie, didn't you?... I can't trust you, bitch - not for one minute... Naughty girl... Sailor and Lula are headed west, and guess what? There's no turning back. I'm in a killing mood.
White Boy, how much is the reward on the man again?
What's the matter with right here? It's nice and warm.
I'm asking you for an example of one of these dumb fucks being a dumb fuck.
Thanks for handling this.
What do you want ?
I think it could be fun.
It is for me.
They were lying. There were no witnesses, no escaped lunatic. The whole community is hiding the truth of what actually happened up there.
I tried to investigate the attack. There are no records. The case was closed and now they've 'misplaced' the file. David's lacerations were cleaned and dressed when he arrived here and yet supposedly no doctor examined him before I did. The Goodman boy is already in the ground so he's no good to us. So I went to the pub in East Proctor where I was convinced of two things.
You've absolutely no idea where David might be?
I think the village of East Proctor is hiding some dark and terrible secret. I'm convinced that, like David, they believe in this werewolf.
David has suffered a severe trauma. I myself witnessed some form of mass neurosis in East Proctor. If all the villagers believe that Jack Goodman was killed by a werewolf, why shouldn't David? And then it follows that if he survived an attack by a werewolf, wouldn't he himself become a werewolf the next full moon?
Speaking of money. You said billions. How many?
Shakespeare never said that.
How do you know?
No, I'm not -- I've got some packing to do. I'm also going back to Paris today.
Oh. Well, wasn't it Shakespeare who said: "When strangers do meet they should erelong see one another again"?
Mr. Joshua. Well, I've enjoyed talking with you.
Now you're angry.
Is your husband with you?
Oh, Charles is hardly ever with me. First it was separate rooms -- now we're trying it with cities. What do people call you -- Pete?
It's terrible -- you just made it up.
Well, the idea's right, anyway. Are you going to call me?
What is it, my boy?
And when my father was Sheriff?
No dollar.
That was the night he disappeared?
Now. Wait. You didn't actually sign with Sugar, did you? Tell me you didn't sign. Because I'm still sort of moved by your "my word is stronger'n oak" thing --
You don't have to be unfriendly.
See?
"Life can be beautiful." Hey, I know where it was.
Where I saw you. Everything going okay now? You live around here?
See, I'm new.
Elaine, when are you going to realize Simon Kurtz put me in here to get me out of the way.
What was your deal with him?
Wait a second. You want me, don t you?
Hey! I was watching that!
Well that s just great...those little monkeys can be a real handful...
I m working on a new deal now...
Is that a baby?
Who was Gilda?
Actually, I can't think really -- let me just have a quick look...
More than that actually, when you think about it. You know, Meatloaf has a very nice pair...
Oh, yuh did, huh?
There you go. I left it blank.
Excellent. Here they come.
Sure, I do
See that? Who needs affection when I've got blind hatred?
You know, fathers don't like to admit that their daughters are capable of running their own lives. It means we've become spectators. Bianca still lets me play a few innings. You've had me on the bleachers for years. When you go to Sarah Lawrence, I won't even be able to watch the game.
No -- impressed.
Bianca did what?
Which parts?
So tell me about this dance. Was it fun?
I don't know.
That's right -- I'm at last going out on a date with the great Janine and I just want to be sure I've picked the right t-shirt.
Plus a trust fund to provide for the boy s education.
Fine. Could you please see that she gets this.
Do you know when she'll be back?
Guess so.
I need to talk to Annette.
It was a crime.
SMI represents all three quarterbacks on your team, where's their loyalty going to be? You stay with me, I'd fight for YOU alone. You'd be my only client on that team...
I've got the clients. I've got the juice.
No.
Yeah, yeah -- 'bye.
Go get a soda out of the fridge.
Okay.
It'll be over soon. I can get you money.
You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is.
I'll have some of your water. It's hot.
Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
No. I think you'll want to wait on that.
I thought I made myself perfectly clear. You do not leave your room until Her Majesty requests it.
Well, you tell Her Majesty from me, if her husband was here now, he'd have had her out of that house and getting some air in her. What the hell's the point in me being here otherwise?!
Go inside at once.
My God! Serafine's right. It's time to go. We'll talk soon.
I didn't come all this way to sit on my arse.
You will await your orders like everyone else. Unless you prefer a repeat of yesterday's little excitement.
No.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, it most certainly is!
Am I going to Detroit by myself?
Think this old guy is her boyfriend? It's the only picture she carries.
You'll have to ask Glenn. And most likely, he's on his way to Detroit, where we should be.
Yeah, but what happened after she drove off with Glenn?
Say anything in there about Karen Sisco?
Paper says there's ten grand each on you, Chino and Lulu.
We'll leave first thing in the morning.
Longer we hang around down here, Jack, better chance there is either Glenn's gonna fuck up the whole score, or we gonna get busted, or both.
You're too easily impressed with yourself. I believe I've made that point before.
The Rembrandt--that was quite good.
"You can't know the horrible disappointment I feel..."
She can't still be angry at this, it's gotta get better.
Where's your bike?
I know this part, keep reading.
Your lip bleeding?
What's wrong with your eyes?
Just her name.
Hey look at this!
What d'you think?
Yeah.
I'm working across on a cattle boat.
Mr. Gower . . . Mr. Gower . . . thanks ever so much for the bag. It's just exactly what I wanted.
Oh, it's wonderful.
Anybody know about this?
Well, I'm writing another article on the cacophony.
Like 'Smith' or 'Jones --'
Yes I'm fine.
Why you wearin' a suit?
Without question.
Thank you.
Ok.
Hey...Lance....can I.....
You ok?
Jack ... Jack ... You're acting like a kid.
Listen, please accept my apologies for... you know, me pretending to be the... well it wasn't really my idea... well, yes it was my idea but...
Depends one which one.
Louis... water and fresh straw!
I was.
How did you know!
No, that's really unneces --
I wasn't trying --
No, no, no, I'll be fine. I'll just hang my shirttail out and work on it in the morning.
Didn't you hear him? Of course he's coming back here. Keep going, will you?
Railroad tickets.
Bruce? Oh -- er -- he went out to get the tickets.
Well, keep going! We want an extra out on the streets before it's too late!
No one you know.
Eight o'clock. Kross is bringing his son. Very bright kid, watch yourself with him. Who's this girl you're taking?
What!?
What time's diner tonight?
It's okay, really.
I mean, it's okay if you want to sit down here. I didn't mean to --
No, I mean, I don't know. I can't really think of much to say probably.
Anyway. Sorry. Hi.
Peter. I don't see you rushing home to trim the tree.
I suppose it's too late to start over.
You guys are heartless, my bride picked this out.
Yeah, it's in the contract.
Babalouey, you were perfect, I could hardly keep from busting up.
You know, I've been thinking about what you said yesterday, about the orientation film being a cover-up. I think you're on to something.
No, really.
Yeah, just an idea I had.
That'll happen when you're about to spend thirty billion dollars on some aspirin...
Hannah and I...can't have any children. Now I-I-I don't want to get into whose fault it-- It's my fault that we can't and- and-and the details are too embarrassing to--
Uh... good.
I don't know.
Sure -- I don't even feel it.
Jacques! Johana!
I didn't come here to play Dumbo on the radio. So tomorrow between 5 and 7 give yourself a hand, that clear pal?
No... no thank you notes.
Thanks very much.
I believe you.
Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that! Oh, dear.
I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
But I don't have it.
And I'm afraid we want it back.
She... went into the Bay.
Your bother is in America fighting the rebels.
I figured that out.
Yes, he's fine.
Norman Rockwell's enduring portrait of a Homecoming The return of a fighting man has always been one of the more moving ceremonies of war... Tearful women, proud men, excited children. But J.D. Singer was right -- his homecoming was no big deal.
Hey, Evelyn, it's your favorite client.
I don't know. Tastes okay to me. Hey, they got a reserve pinot.
Tastes like the back of a fucking LA schoolbus. Probably didn't de-stem, hoping for some semblance of concentration, crushed it up with leaves and mice, wound up with this rancid tar and turpentine mouthwash bullshit. Fucking Raid.
What's up?
Let me use your phone.
I can't take it anymore. I've got to call Evelyn.
I didn't give you away the first time.
This'll do.
Are you gonna do what I think you're gonna do?
Be more specific.
What makes you think I'd go for that bet? That's a seventy thousand dollar car.
Even there?
Yep.
God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"! You wanta step outside!
You could be one of those guys-- but you don't give a fuck, Meat.
How?
You try it.
I won't tell you it'll stop feeling this bad... But I can tell you, you didn't do anything wrong... The same thing would have happened to me... or Frank... or Joe... And there's no sense in looking for a reason why things happen... I used to try and... always came up short. I don't think the why so's important as... what we do with what we get. I remember this boy I'd see up on the Blackfeet Reservation. He was sixteen. Great kid. Strong. He'd gone swimming and dived headfirst into a rock. Snapped his neck, paralyzed him... After the accident, I'd look in on him from time to time... and he wasn't there anymore. His mind, his spirit, whatever you want to call it, it just disappeared. And what was left was nothing but anger... It's like the boy I knew just went away somewhere...
Oh. Okay then... Lloyd Dobler, 555-1342.
So what?
Oh, I'm taking you...quite seriously.
I sincerely hope so.
Thank you. Would you like the man's name?
No.
I'll just go to Heaven.
Do me.
I love you.
I like your hair. And that suit.
Thirty-two outta what, twenty?
Himey here's a pro-toh-jay of mine. He's ranked number thirty-two in the federal prison system.
I don't smoke.
Remember the time we broke into the D.A.'s office, and copied Fifi Randell's diary?
I mean -- working together. Just like the old days. The things we've been through, Hildy.
Uh-uh. As long as we were in there together pitching -- they couldn't lick us. Well, it's been a lot of fun.
Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's physician. We proved she was poisoned though, didn't we?
What?
I'll try to be more careful.
The thing's kind of heavy.
No, I just meant...
About as much as they think about killing me.
Somebody does. It's more honest this way. You do your own dirty work.
You're not, cause you eat frozen meatballs? Things die. Every time you breathe, you kill millions of tiny organisms. Every time you eat, something had to die.
It's not suffering anymore.
They know the rules... That's the deal. That's why you're up there. It's him or me. That's the price of admission. It bothers you, why? You're part of it. Everybody dies. Most people don't get to die for something.
Huh?
It? Who does?
Planet 10? The same Planet 10 you postulated beyond Pluto, Perfect Tommy? The invisible body?
Her or me?
My wife used to call me that.
What did Bobby Vasquez used to call you?
There's Pepsi in the fridge.
I'm freezing.
Bullshit, Erin. Bullshit.
Alex, I've lost my mind. I woke up at the zoo! But you know what? I feel terrific!
Uh-huh.
Goodbye? Where're you going? What about our partnership? I'm making real progress with the microchip.
Sure.
She didn't mean it, Doc -- it was an accident -- she had a little too much to drink and -- she didn't know what she was doing -- there was no suicide note or anything -- believe me, Doc, I'm not thinking about myself --
Here.
No.
Yes.
I don't know, I'm afraid.
Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that -- -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.
Stuck on her! Obviously, you don't know me very well.
I remember. Hi Roberto!
No, you were brilliant
Look at me, Mary. On my mother's soul, on God above, on everything that is holy to me, I did not steal your shoes.
So this is the favour you find in the Chamberlain's Men.
You have opened the playhouses?
I would have made you immortal. Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.
Because -- Mrs. Robinson this is the sickest, most perverted thing that ever happened to me. And you do what you want but I'm getting the hell out.
Yes. What is rent?
Never let go.
You must do me this honor... promise me you will survive... that you will never give up... no matter what happens... no matter how hopeless... promise me now, and never let go of that promise.
Hello, friend, my name is Nicky. I understand you're seeking a roommate, as per your advertisement in the Village Voice. Would it be possible for me to fill the slot?
Did you tell anybody?
No.
Off limits.
I don t think I d fight you on that one...
Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
Well - I'm a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It's dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?
It's not exploitation. These people wanna sell and I wanna buy. How are golf clubs exploitation? She takes one night class and suddenly she's a socialist.
We're all desperate for the money, doll. That's what made this country great. Back me up on this Candy, am I right?
Yeah?
Nothing. Everything's great. Terrific.
So talk to me tomorrow. After the gig.
It's not family. It's business.
That's it! Exactly! You're reading my mind --
Yeah --
Can I tell you something? Can I tell you a secret?
Can you understand how meaningless everything is? Everything! I'm talking about nnnn--our lives, the show...the whole world, it's meaningless.
Do you realize what a thread we're all hanging by?
No, I'm not dying now, but, but you know, when I ran out of the hospital, I, I was so thrilled because they told me I was going to be all right. And I'm running down the street, and suddenly I stop, 'cause it hit me, all right, so, you know, I'm not going to go today. I'm okay. I'm not going to go tomorrow. But eventually, I'm going to be in that position.
You'll be fine for a few minutes.
I thought she built it herself.
Good. I've always said you were wasting your time in the underwear department.
I have no illusions about the future. What is, is. We make choices. And we become the sum total of our choices. I can live with that.
Yes, my dear?
Wandering.
What's the matter?
I don't know, I just got-I got very dizzy... I feel dizzy, Max.
Well, sit down.
Oh, Jesus.
You all right?
I don't know, I mean, I-
You wanna lie down?
No, no-my, you know, my stomach felt queasy all morning. I just started getting...
How about a ginger ale?
Oh, Max... no, I maybe I better lie down.
Yes, everything they've got. How are the passengers doing?
Surely there must be something you can do.
Care for a smoke?
No sin? Maybe. Not yet. But, Rachel, it does not look... Don't you know there has been talk? Talk about you, not him. Talk about going to the Bishop. About having you... shunned!
Do not make light of it, Rachel. They can do it... quick! Like that! And then... then I can not sit at table with you. I can not take a thing from your hand. I... I can not go with you to meeting! Rachel, good Rachel, you must not go too far! Dear child!
How can this be? How can you do such a thing? Is this plain? Is this the ordnung?
Eh? Nothing? Rachel, you bring this man to our house. With his gun of the hand. You bring fear to this house. Fear of English with guns coming after. You bring blood and whispers of more blood. Now English music... and you are dancing to English music! And you call this nothing?
You are acting like one!
Anybody we know?
My agent says I've got a good shot at being the Prada guy next year.
Action?
1002.
The bachelor party's upstairs. They made me get naked. They hung me from the window so high up it was so scary I fell down...
Right here? Well, you're being so bossy I wasn't sure!
You wanted to see me!
Why are you suddenly so mad at me?
...Still don't feel no heat.
How 'bout this Billy Snow?
Thanks, Mr. Gazzo.
How 'bout this Big Chuck Smith?
The jacket and the pair of pants came with the body I took. Let me ask your opinion. Do I blend in?
You want me to be your guide --?
That's me.
'...Yes --'
You don't remember anything else from that last night you saw him, do you?
I don't know.
Right. Okay, then. Shall we go?
Would you marry me if I was?
Not in love, exactly, but...
Are you persuadable?
There's the third one. If I don't get the last one, there's a certain sob sister I know that's going to get a kick right in the . . . oh! Whoops, almost had that.
I used to think my biography would be JACK LUCAS - THE FACE BEHIND THE VOICE, but now it can be JACK LUCAS, THE FACE "AND" THE VOICE...or maybe just JACK - EXCLAMATION POINT...
The greatest yarn ever written by anybody. My hat's off to you, Hildy!
Well -- what is it?
What do I have to do to satisfy you -- become the next victim?
Flip a coin.
Then why are you doing it?
Hildy!
All it was wearing was a big old Masonic ring and a Rio County Sheriffs badge.
Chucho Montoya saw it with his own eyes. Shot him in cold blood.
Well, you were working there--
And your mother was a saint. That summer I built the patio at your house? She made me lunch every day.
You built our patio while you were on the county?
It could have just been a box lunch from the jail.
I've heard Wade was a bit tough on the Mexicans--
Murdered him?
He murdered Eladio Cruz. That tough enough for you?
Clarence...
You okay?
Sure I'm insane, but I've got some good news for you. This magnolia is leaving your sweet smelling vanilla joint. This bird in a cage is gonna button his own pants from now on. And that is what is known as telling the mother- in-law.
He can't hear with that rig on-- Mikey!
Yes, sir.
Gosh, she looks better every time I see her.
Thank you very much.
I mean I'm a fucking fraud. I'm no architect. Don't be a putz -- who's been to Santiago twice in a year? Estadio Olimpico -- please!
But... but you knew people at Harvard.
I knew shit. The only thing I knew was that you were a fake and I made up everything else. My real name's Norm. I deliver pizzas.
What's the bible for?
Bullshit!
I don't know. Probably have a copy of my birth certificate...my apartment.
But you don't hate him.
Man, is this interesting.
How many times a year.
Wait a minute. So you wouldn't say you loved him.
So you don't love him. You wouldn't say you --
You re sure you won t sit down, Miss Stewart?
She finds him "personable."
I was just playing with you.
Metallica, Dad. Come on.
Who is this, Metal-lick-a?
Well, I thought that after messing with your head, I'd give you a little kick in the keester.
I don't care what kind of mood you're in at the start of that song. When it's over, that mood has been altered. Wow. Great shit. What's next?
Definitely.
Now that was an experience. "You are only coming through in waves." That line blows my mind every time.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. After careful consideration, I regretfully have to decline.
Where is he? He's supposed to be here.
So go dance.
Thank you, sir. Thank you. I promise I will repay you.
In time, you will see that this is the best thing.
Well... Well... these birds attacked us.
Business is very food, thanks. ELIZABETH What's very food?
Hi Walter.
That was weird. I meant good.
Did I say that?
Would you just shut up a minute and let me think?
Yeah, but you said, "Will it change my wife"!
Whatta you mean? Me?
Sinatra had gl- You never said Sinatra had glasses. So whatta you saying that I-I'm suffocating you?
Tsch, what'd the doctor say?
Will it change your wife?
What? No I'm not.
I wasn't making fun of you.
I'll do it.
Wow - I-
I promise... I swear.
Not by the thousands.
No... go on.
You see I couldn't shout that.
Anything, Ninotchka.
Loretta, what are you talking about?
No. If I screw up, I wanta do it alone. I'll call.
Don't worry.
I gotta go now, Dad.
I think I'm ready for the Show.
I won't be needing these anymore.
You too...Meat.
You promise to stay down there for an hour?
But how do you know what you hear is the truth?
Because then you couldn't hide behind your books and your telescope and your sweater and your God.
Okay. Okay. Okay. All right. So long. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 124.
I don't want to be just your friend --
Mars.
A Thermos of hot coffee. A blanket. Socks.
This is it. I'm in hell. Damned to an eternity of idiotic conversation.
Hmm! So am I. If you'll excuse me I have some important unfinished business. I'll see you all later.
Hoped for it.
We'll be expecting you.
Great place huh?
Huh. You used to come to the club? I shouldn't have let you in. You must have only been about sixteen.
Right. Why?
Uh. That's me.
What I mean is, I didn't mean you look young. You don't. You don't look old either. You look just as old as you are. A bit younger maybe, but not a lot. Not much. Just right.
That's just my game.
I found something in my sleep. The Friar who married them will take up their destinies.
How are you?
In heaven, perhaps. It is not a comedy I am writing now. A broad river divides my lovers--family, duty, fate--as unchangeable as nature.
What do you mean?
Don't run off -- like everything's settled the minute you make up your mind.
I wish I had better news... Our compassion index is off seven points from the last sample and that's down eighteen on the year. The Cares About People Like Me' numbers are really in the toilet. We're off twenty points from March and that was right after we raised interest rates...
I didn't say.
What side of the industry did you say you were on?
How long you here, Joe?
No --
When I found you?
Course, if Carl lost both batteries, dead in the water, his radio wouldn't work. So how would he signal for help?
Why, D. B., you're not going to fall for
Look. We can't let 'em get to this bush-league pitcher and start pumping him. Good night! No telling what that screwball might do. I walked in yesterday here he is, standing on a table with a fishing pole flycasting. Take my advice and get him out of town before this thing explodes in our faces!
No, you've got yourself a meal ticket and you hate to let go.
Kat! Wake up!
Were you with him last night?
Who are you?
When was the last time you saw John Boz?
Why do you think he's dead?
Yeah . . yeah . . . maybe . . . maybe . . .
That woman. The older woman.
That woman --
Yes. The married woman -- it wasn't just some woman --
Elaine --
Uh... uh, you're-you're exceptional in bed because you got -you get pleasure in every part of your body when I touch you.
You know what I mean? Like the tip o'your nose, and if I stroke your teeth or your kneecaps... you get excited.
Now, Swana...
I understand how you feel, but there is a limit to everything, particularly pride and dignity. They are willing to pay any price! They have a circulation of two million!
Sweetheart, we won't have to bother about our future if you are willing to raffle off your past!
Yes, I'm your little Volga boatman.
Well, Alan, I think we re gonna have a banner year. Sales are up almost twenty percent in the first quarter and we just landed a major trucking company account.
Really. So you re projecting what, a tad over two million?
We did one point seven million in total revenue...
Uh huh...one point seven. And what do you project for this year?
That s right. And auto supply...
Uh huh. The retail end, I understand.
Uh...we actually get about sixty percent of our business from automotive service.
Mind if I ask what kind of sales you did last year? Ballpark...
No -- Kevin, you?
I couldn't tell -- She could've meant like, "I love you grandma" or "I love you Vanderbilt."
Roussel? You mean Claude? You're calling Dr. Demento so he can come paint my face again? Fuck that.
Allo?
Serafine? Is that you? What's going on?
God, well don't let him go! Catch him!
Lady Cosgrove, you are an old fool.
No, sir. I didn't want the publicity. Harry's homecoming tomorrow . . .
No, sir. No, sir. I haven't.
I can't get hold of him. He's in Europe.
They don't have that kind of money, Mr. Potter. You know that. You're the only one in town that can help me.
That's the wrong one.
I know.
Yeah? Allison what?
H'm, I'm sorry, I can't go through with this, because it-I can't get it off my mind, Allison... it's obsessing me!
It-but it-it... doesn't make any sense. He drove past the book depository and the police said conclusively that it was an exit wound. So-how is it possible for Oswald to have fired from two angles at once? It doesn't make sense.
It's all right.
Do you?
He is. But he was here...
What do you mean?!
There's a store around the corner, I'll be right back.
So I am to understand from your re- sponse that you do not want to hear the details of Bontecou's offer?
Hello, Violet.
Hee-haw!
Wrong! Your ears you keep, and I'll tell you why --
I don't know. Got it from Stephanie.
Why are you so hostile? I know you're frustrated with your life right now, but you can choose not to be so hostile. Here.
Fucker hit into us.
I guess.
Have you slept with him yet?
No, not -- I mean have you, you know --
Well... we are, of course, enormously grateful for your past efforts, but your task is done. Now it's time for negotiation... and after many months of skillful work, our dear Tremoille is about to seal a treaty with our Burgundian friends who will no longer lend their support to the English. You see, my dear Jeanne... as it is written in the Bible, "to everything there is a season: a time for war, and a time for peace"...
Gave you? Well now, I wouldn't quite put it like that...
Why do you have to be so bloodthirsty? Do you enjoy it? All that blood and noise and pain? Diplomacy is far more civilized... far safer... and far cheaper...
Maybe he ought to go to beauty school. Anyway, see you tonight, doll, okay?
Okay.
I want you to know it's over. We're leaving and we're not Coming back.
Next thing you know he'll find you keen and peachy, you know? Next thing you know he's got his hand on your ass!
Hey, don't knock masturbation! It's sex with someone I love.
What's the difference? It's all mental masturbation.
Oh, stop it. But you were having an affair with your college professor. That jerk that teaches that incredible crap course "Contemporary Crisis in Western Man"!
Of course.
And I in yours.
I'm just talking on the phone to you and standing.
Nothing.
Yes I am.
Hi, Kathleen, I'm just working.
Seven o'clock.
Did I tell you I have a new girlfriend?
This one's history. Moving on...
I wonder if I should invite my girlfriend over, too. I have a girlfriend now.
You can if you want.
I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.
She likes you okay.
Yeah?
Just wanted to let you know.
I'd rather have a knife.
Derogatory? Yeah, he's great.
Let them come! Let them see who's the true king of France!
Well, it looks like you're a little late.
Serves me right for asking a direct question. The subject is closed.
That was some going-over your men gave my place this afternoon. We just barely got cleaned up in time to open.
Well, Ricky. I'm very pleased with you. Now you're beginning to live like a Frenchman.
Louis, are you pro-Vichy or Free French?
Well, I told Strasser he wouldn't find the letters here. But I told my men to be especially destructive. You know how that impresses Germans? Rick, have you got these letters of transit?
Where are we going?
It'd be the best thing for you. You know what? I'm going to get you laid this week. That's going to be my best man gift to you. I'm not going to give you a pen knife or a gift certificate or any of that other horseshit.
I'm sorry. I've got plans.
Who else knows about the boy?
Whattaya mean family?
You should work for yourself.
They up?
I don't do favors for you anymore.
How long's this whole thing gonna take?
Yeah, well -- good help is hard to find.
I insist--and a beaker for Mr. Marlowe. The BARMAN does the business.
Leaving them here when we could just as well take them. We got plenty of room in the wagon. And -- and -- they cook and drive the mules. They don't bother anybody.
Got you a pack of Mores again, huh?
Lula... I learned somethin' interestin' today on a science show I heard on the radio... How leeches is comin' back into style.
Let's get fed, sweetheart. The light's fadin' fast.
I don't understand why you were dragged out here, Sir. It's hardly worth wasting your time--a no-nothing case like this.
It's all right.
I'm proud of you, Vincent.
--What car?--Go to sleep.
Really?
--I walked right in front of it. I was never more sober in my life.
I don't blame you. So we'd both fuck Elvis. It's nice to meet people with common interests, isn't it?
You will stay, Doctor -- if you have nothing better to do?
I have nothing better to do, Mr. Kringelein.
Do I know him -- I know him through and through.
Perhaps you could present me now, Mr. Pimenov.
She makes felt wallets. Got one right here.
Yeah. I know. Leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?
Few suicide attempts, little inpatient stint. Naturally, she misses her kids. Six weekends a year and alternate Yom Kippurs seemed harsh to us but -- hey -- all's fair. Anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.
So she's uh, flourishing?
Yep. My divorce just came through. Shoulda called you. Coulda cut a better deal! My wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. But, I don't know. Guess I'm just a softie. After all Amanda and me were together for -- what -- you'd know better than me, Marylin. She was your best friend.
You'll be dead soon enough anyway, so why be in such a hurry? Why not face up to your lies? It's your lies you can't stand anymore...
And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
Yes.
No.
What?
All right then.
Look -- I drove you home. I was glad to do it. But I have some things on my mind. Can you understand that?
Why not?
When is he coming back?
So you know what she does? She's so grief stricken she runs to find solace in Rudy Levine's bed.
Catch your breath.
Like, look at her. She looks like she fell off an ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down. Elvis wouldn't fuck her with Pat Boone's dick.
Does it now?
I take no account of gossip, Your Highness.
Yessir, there'd been real heavy fog.
Okay This is okay. Smooth. Can I ask you something? Do you think I tell too many stories in class?
I don't think I've had that pleasure.
Your Royal Highness. What a pleasure to see you here.
Maybe.
You think your dearest love will save you? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 50.
What if it's true? "Great at friendship bad at intimacy." I mean, come on. It's the theme of my bachelor film --
That's a good idea, sire.
They came at me from all sides, hundreds of 'em. We kept firing - Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! "Throw the grenades," I shouted. "Mac, throw the grenades!" "He's dead," Joe said, and kept right on feeding me bullets. Zat-Tat-Tat-Tat! They kept falling, but they kept coming. Bullets whizzing all around me. Zot! Joe falls back with a neat red hole in his head. I thought I was done for. But I kept firing. Zat-Tat-Tat! Only one thought kept me going. Kill! Kill! For Mac, and Joe, and the rest of the guys. Kill! - a blinding flash. I wake up on a stretcher. "Did we hold?" I asked the medic. "Yes, sir," he said, and I slipped into unconsciousness.
You admit to me you do not love your fiance?
Jeez, sir. That's pretty strong stuff.
And so I ask you - why the hell did we give up on the Germans? Those damn politicians in Washington chalked them up on our side and the wars ever since have been a national disgrace. Hell, look at history. The two best wars this country has fought were against the Jerries. Now I say, get the Krauts on the other side of the fence where they belong, and let's get back to the kind of enemy worth killing and the kind of war this whole country can support.
Yes, some of the time.
I'm not going to think about what they're not teaching you in school. I am not going to think about it. Generally speaking I think we should rule out people who don't live somewhere near here --
Stand back.
Woah!!
Pointing There's a beehive right there!
Hey Vada, guess what we got?
THIS!!
She's willing to fly anywhere.
She's probably just having a fit of nostalgia. You know, lonely Christmas Eve, call the one that got away, that kind of thing.
And God love you for it.
One... two... three. You are now awake.
I'm afraid.
Couldn't make the last edition. It'd take me four hours to translate your story into English.
Impossible. Put it on again.
Why?
I don't know that Ellie. He might get out. Garber's not bein' straight with the witness, she could be in deep shit if she identifies him, and it's my job to convince her she won't be.
I might stop you.
I think -- she's crazy.
No! No! I'm sorry. Ninety-seven five right?
Good night, Miss Kubelik.
I just hate seeing you so stuck.
Any messages, Carmen?
You're working too hard, Baxter. It's New Year's Eve -- relax.
So then she just stops calling.
I suppose you'll be on the town tonight -- celebrating?
Naturally.
Me, too. I'm taking Miss Kubelik out -- I finally talked her into it --
Right. Hey, shut up. Okay, sir.
That's right.
Why are we doing this?
Where am I?
Because they said it couldn't be done.
What the hell is this doing here?
Some fat slob in the next booth is making a lot of noise.
Yes I did.
I'm gonna run a couple miles ahead of you. Keep both feet on the floor. We'll be moving ninety and over.
Not so good. He wouldn't listen to reason. He stole my car... my Porsche... I can't find it anywhere...
Yeah... This morning. He left this fucking bloody morning... Jesus, man, my knees...
No... No... I swear...
Ever seen him before?
Yeah... The Diplomat.
What s this place? A hotel of some kind?
This is no good. She's looking for someone French. Or Greek. "Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I live in Tulsa." Where is that? --
DIDN'T ... AHHH...LOOK GOOD.
Room service. What do you drink?
Send up a bottle of Crystal champagne.
NO. NO GOOD.
...you shoot a great game of pool.
Oh, my god... Edward, no!
I suppose you'd find out soon enough that you have assets you presently don't seem aware of, wouldn't you? The waste processing licenses at that abandoned shipyard of yours, you'd certainly find out about that.
Boy, we really gave it to her good.
Let him answer.
I don't think there's any sense in --
If you had a... reprieve, what would do?
You wouldn't?
Apparently, Drexl had a big toe stuck in shit like that.
-- What?
Yeah but I didn't do anything about it. Out of respect for our marriage.
Yeah. Drexl had an association with a fella named Blue Lou Boyle. Name mean anything to you?
Exactly, I mean, after all, we're men!
So, not married. Well, good for you. You play the field, like me. A girl in every port, huh?
How much money you have between the two a'ya right now?...
Forty bucks...
Come on outside, I got somethin' to show ya.
Don't think about it too long. You had enough?
Have now.
Just took a guess is all... You in or out on this deal?
I ain't fuckin' sure, Bobby.
This is easy money, pardner... No ones gonna get hurt in this thing... And I don't think you can afford not to take it... I'll be bringin' the Eldo 'round the front of the motel at ten tomorrow mornin'... If you ain't a pussy - you'll be there.
I don't particularly care for that kind of talk, Bobby.
We have opened a restaurant...
I tell you she's mine!
Shall we tell her?
Ninotchka, we are in the magic East, the country of Aladdin and His Lamp...
That was our idea when we first came. All we thought we would get out of this trip was a Turkish bath, but... we learned better.
All you have to do is say "open sesame."
...Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves... into one single hour you can crowd a thousand and one nights.
Sweeter than bee pollen on a summer wind.
You are fair as the first new flower of spring...
I'm promised to another!
Nay, Oona, tis not possible.
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he dares, being dared.
But alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter Tybalt?
I'll bet you can't remember what you were doing here, can you? I mean, how much are you making now? Sixty? Seventy? And you were living in this shitty place.
I hate him too. So I just call him "Mavis." Or "Sissyboy." Or "Mavis the Sissyboy."
This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.
I'm sorry, but can we get this straight? What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray? What do you call him?
You know I'm a good person.
To be killed in battle?
Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
Will you at least let me stay with you?
Where'd he come from?
Yes?
That's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship.
I dove 315 feet!
Did you ever see 'Eldorado?'
Sears sucks, Crash, I tried it once. Sold Lady Kenmores--it's nasty, nasty work.
He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
I like you, Maude.
What?
No. I think anyone who puckers their lips and presses it against his boss' buttocks and then smooches is an ass kisser.
Love.
Hey... I can't control it. It's just, something that happened.
And there's the winner of the Truman Capote look-alike contest.
Almost didn't recognize you with your hair like that. How you been?
Nona, please.
What's that, not great?
That's a start. I'm at the Brevoort now. I'll be looking for you.
Now stop wasting time, Thorwald, or I'll hang up and call the police.
For a little business meeting -- to settle the estate of your late wife.
I'll give you a chance to find out. Meet me in the bar at the Brevoort -- and do it right away.
Well -- did you get it, Thorwald?
Oh, he won't be followed here.
I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
I have the letters right here.
Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
Is everything ready?
Sam's piano.
Serves me right for not being musical.
Oh dear, why is life so complicated? Sometimes I really wish I could be someone else.
Jeez, Mrs. Raymond, that was eleven years ago.
Really. You sleeping?
Only on odd days.
Seeing anyone in particular?
Why the interest?
Trust me, you're not missing anything.
You look awful.
Thanks.
Because I'm your brother. Because I care about you. Because sometimes it seems like the most significant relationship in your life is with that goddamn dog of yours.
I'm not seeing anyone. In particular.
No. What's that?
Get that doctor.
Ha.
Oh. Well. We don't really get along. Paul and I.
Where?
Nothing.
Hi.
Trouble. Why?
No, I don't mind.
Because I already tried once.
No. I couldn't.
I had a temper.
Last night? I was at home.
We millionaires yet?
FEZZIK, are there rocks ahead?
I got a call from him today. Funny. He dropped out of sight during the war, and I'd heard he'd gone East. I guess he's back. It's a Mission number.
Really? That's sudden.
Sikh. If he wears a turban, he's a Sikh.
You're always so coarse... "Do her right here." Let's just see what happens, okay? "I wish that I could find a way; To speak my thoughts on Mother's Day. There are no words that quite express; My gratitude or happiness. A pleasant smile perhaps a kiss; I would not fail to give her this. I'd make her glad the whole day through; By sayin' 'Mother', I love you!' P.S. I wish I could say this to my mother's face, but I can't anymore."
And then we're gonna do her right here. Right?
It's not an exact science, Wesley. He said they'll be here... My Houston contact has always been very reliable.
Thas' it, thas' it... conquer that bitch. What time're they coming?
Rose this not the place to be having this...
But I have my clothes on!
Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
Do they have him on display at the weekends?
You - calling me a thief? Well, that's great, coming from a glorified grave robber! You break into the tomb of some dead Egyptian - the poor guy's happily enjoying the afterlife when suddenly his shit gets stolen by a bunch of light fingered limeys!
Let's do it again.
Queens... You know Queens?
Go ahead, Kat. Hate me. You were running out of steam on the whole Jeffrey thing. Maybe now you ll be able to hold onto this just long enough to ruin your next relationship.
Besides, you hired me for my discretion.
Please. Don't worry about him. And above all, don't antagonize him.
Don't blow it, Elliot. He's bluffin'. He just told you so himself.
You're an actor, so act, motherfucker.
He's bluffin ya, Elliot. Can't you see that? You're an actor, remember, the show must go on.
For how long? And why?
You're competitive soul, Drew. That's what makes you a great addi- tion to the money. Joe is just... around.
Uh ... Frank Baker. This is my brother.
What?
Funny, huh?
Part of being a New Yorker.
Yeah! For all I know, come Monday morning, we ll go back to the real world and...and you ll be hiring me for your best friend!
Do you have a pair that are just friendly?
These are for my sister... her birthday you see. As she'll be eleven and... well, frankly, I wouldn't want a pair of birds that were too demonstrative.
As the same time, I wouldn't want birds that were aloof, either.
Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true?
To warn her about Chino.
I don't think we should get into that.
Don't talk like that, okay? You scare me.
You coming back?
Don't worry about it.
No.
Terrific. Thirty-eight.
We ran long.
Miss --
Thank you for being kind enough to lie. You see, I've been very lonely in my isolated tower of indecipherable speech. You're hired. Any questions?
I ll just check into a hotel.
Low overhead, m'boy. We pass the savings on to you. But seriously, that's all covered in orientation.
You don't have to.
We'll worry about that when we get there.
What do we have to know, Mother? We're all together, we all love each other, we all need each other. What else is there? Mother, I want us to stay alive!
Your imagination runs away with you, Jack... Those bones be but battlefield gleanings, like I mentioned. A wee bit of carrion to frighten off the uninvited.
I can't hear you. I can't hear anything. I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm gonna lose hearing in my ear! I'm--
Hello Lydia?
He has it. Thank you.
How is it back there?
I thought... if... if I can help him in some way... you know?... get him this girl he loves... Then... maybe.... things'll start changing for me... My luck, ya know... Maybe... Forget it... It's a stupid idea.
I'll find something that won't kill them.
You're a good mother.
No, I'm...thanks. I took something.
He won't use my shower. I don't get it.
You brought your kids?
I think so.
I try not to expect you.
Look, I'd help ya if I could, but I haven't seen Clarence -
No.
Listen to me! Lisa's been arrested.
Look Jeff, don't louse up my night with another man killer stuffing a grisly trunk that turns out to be --
My Lisa. She went into Thorwald's apartment, and he came back. The only way I could get her out was to call the police.
Your Lisa?
Jefferies.
Tom, I've got something real big for you.
This is Doyle, Jeff.
Aren't you ever going to get married?
I know what you told me! She went in to get evidence, and she came out with it.
I told you that --
Watch it. They're coming out.
Anything. Just don't let Salucci think we're onto him.
Joe, you don't want to blow that thing and kill all these innocent people.
Joe, the insurance policy won't help your wife and kids. You bought auto insurance, not life insurance.
That's right, Joe. Now, no one's going to hurt you and no one has to know what's wrong with you.
Yeah, but then I fucked up. I fell for her.
Besides, I had some extra cash. Some asshole paid me to take out a really great girl.
I thought you could use it. When you start your band.
I'm sorry. I had the television set had the television-
Oh, Jesus, really?
What?
W-w-whatta you mean?
Oh, I had the radio on.
No.
Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
I love you in an evening gown.
Because that's the kind of man Bill Parrish is.
You think so? How do you know?
Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
Here now, what are you fixin' to do?
Nobody meant any harm. The boy was curious. I unloaded the gun -
I'm sorry, Bob. She kissed me back.
But if you'll just give me...
You weren't expecting me?
OK...
Good, this way we can finally talk. I'll convince him this time.
Who?
My dad's a lieutenant colonel in the army, he wants me to join, he wants to pull some strings. I mean, there's no possible way.
How many people really know what they want though? I mean, a lot of them think that they have to know, right? But inside, they don't really know, so, I don't know. But I know that I don't know.
I hate parties --
Hi, honey.
Drew's aboard?
Isn't it enough to be on this earth sixty-five years without having to be reminded of it.
That you come with me.
Yeah, they're great. Sporty. They're really sporty.
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
Same to you.
What?
I had foreseen that you would not. But Your Majesty should understand -- that my mind will not be changed in this. I leave for Deeside --
Yes, ma'am.
What's up?
How're you doin' today?
It's another day. I think I'm alright.
Can't you get to sleep?
There is one more thing.
Look, I don't know this is pretty heavy-duty, so if you wanna explode, feel free.
You've heard of mail-order brides? Well they go that way, too.
All the same, I still want to call her. I know it sounds crazy -- Mary sure has a lot of troubles in her life -- but, I don't know, maybe I can help her out. The poor thing's had it tough -- she's in a wheelchair for Godsakes.
It's a goddamn bunion. It'll heal.
Oh. I thought That's not it anyway. I know this doesn't make any sense to you, but I just can't turn it off that fast. I still feel something for her.
Okay, tell you what: I'll get her number for you just as soon as she gets back from Japan.
Well I think you're right, I should look her up.
Rollerpig? Are you nuts?
I said buttplug. She's heinous.
Oh, don't go.
You mean the seven billion.
Yes?
The Baron hides in the dark in a passage under the Castle... Quick, give me the dwarf's key... the one which opens any lock...
In the dark, lad? Why should he do that?
Sunlight, you say?
The kitchen be the most important room in a palace, for if the victuals ain't right, little else is likely to be so.
There you go again! How many times did I tell you to stop butting in when I have an argument?
Just call me Gaston.
That's ok, you'll figure it out.
We could...we could do that.
Well...
Certainly, outside. All the best homes have 'em outside.
What!? Look at the ticket...!
I m guessing MacCallum, 18 years. Neat, with a water-back.
Just looking around.
Oh yeah, let me give you another card.
I read this book, book on Spiritualism...
No comment?! Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically!
Did you guys hook up or something?
Then what the hell are you talking about?
I don't get it, that really works?
I went pretty good for a while, didn't I, Al? But I didn't stay in shape and I had to take a few dives.
Good thing there's not a red line on you, J-man. YEAH!
I'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch.
There are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us.
Almost as good as you.
You're a good liar.
I always win, Jack. One way or another. Pity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning.
He's back. Hey my brother, can I borrow a copy of your 'Hey Soul Classics'?
Where'd you find the perfect white shirt?
They're executives. They're nervous about everything.
Your Honor, I'm trying to establish the sense of betrayal Miss Lawson felt when she discovered the man she lived with was a different person than she thought he was.
Mr. Roston?
I'll rephrase the question. Mr. Roston isn't it true you are bisexual?
Yes.
And your sexual tastes were something that you hid from Miss Lawson?
I might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell I was a gentleman. They say John Dillinger was a pretty nice guy.
I hear he didn't mean to. The cop fell as Dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.
She did, huh.
Yeah, but in a nice way.
Why not?
Do you want me to work the case, Phil, or do you want me to --
George, could you -- excuse us for a minute?
Care for a splash of wine, Abbe?
The story's thrilling conclusion comes at a premium.
Reagan didn't die. If he had died, everybody would know what Johnny's middle name was.
Connecticut.
That's how journalists. Answer questions.
Great. Who's been doing your hair?
Or we could do that yeah.
We want that money -- now!
Get off my case, Mayo. I didn't grow up rich.
I think we're making some of the locals jealous.
Nice, hospitable folks they get around here. I hope she comes.
She'll come, pard. A rich socialite Oakie like you oughta be a big catch around these parts.
What would you girls like to do? Want to stick around here for a little or... or could I suggest another plan...?
Me, too.
Knowing Larry, he probably missed the flight.
I got the point.
Is that right?
Your husband's?
Something wrong with buttons?
Hochmut?
Anything against zippers?
Now, where were we?
For you to fall in love with me too. Listen carefully. Every night, when I get off work, I'll come and wait beneath your window. Every night. When you change your mind, open your window. That's all. I'll understand...
I don't care. I'll wait.
Oh yes, father. Now everything's clear.
Well, I've got to read them first. Suppose I could get a Coke while I do?
Well, no one in my family did! Dad bought cemetery plots at Oak Ridge. One for him, one for mom.
I don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.
Well, that's crazy. I don't know anybody who gets cremated.
Sure.
When did she decide this?
Neither do I. That's where I found it.
He chopped off the horn and left the rest to rot.
It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
I thought I was here to meet women.
I like her.
Good-bye!
Go to hell.
Go on home. Just leave me the money.
Okay, here... Be a damn fool.
Here be the death weapon; the unicorn's blood dry upon it.
Well, maybe that's it. I'm chicken.
What are ya, chicken, Charlie?
So what are you saying?
Fan of a fan. You see a couple of minors come in?
You're already gettin' psychological input, son.
What about me?
She was there, wasn't she?
He looks a little shrunk, that's all.
I've already solved it. I've hired a hit man.
Do you like baseball?
We can't finish the job. She's on her sixth painter, now she's thinking maybe she wants the fireplace rebricked --
What about camping?
You know I wasn't drunk--I knew what I was doing when I walked in front of that car--
Have you talked to the doctors at all?
Tonight.
What else can we do?
Of course I did.
You are an amazing lover. You should be giving motivational seminars.
It's fine.
I'll do it tomorrow.
Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching.
I wasn't alone. Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in?
Will you help me, Sandy?
They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy. But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help.
Skipper, you can't do this!
I... I stayed at a friend's. Listen, I --
I'm not seeing anyone else. I really was attacked.
Give me the District Attorney's office. I'll tell you what you'll be doing -- making brooms in the State penitentiary. Hello, D'Arrasty! This is Hartwell. Come over to my office, will you? I've just arrested a couple of important birds and I want to take their confessions.
Good Lord! The stamps! Where is he? Sylvie -- we've got to find him!
I'm glad. But what's all this?
Good. I think its time to beckon Mr. Flemmer. Perhaps He can help us out of this pickle.
No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
But of course.
Anybody else?
Television?
I still don't understand why you only bought one dress.
I have work to do.
Why not?
Yes, I remember. He was all schoolyard. They threw him a football once, he tried to dribble it.
That's... pretty frightening.
How do you tell those two apart, anyway?
But I want you to. Please. Please will you believe me.
I love you...
You believe me, don't you?
I'm not. But I'm -- I'm not very proud of what I do. I usually get kind of drunk. I usually drive over to Los Angeles and go to some bars and get kind of drunk. Then I take a hotel room. So I won't have to drive home on the freeway. I mean it kind of scares me to drive home after --
I do.
Exactly.
Yes, you do! I need you. More than you can imagine! Stand up straight!
Because...
It shuts off automatically.
No. They all do.
Peppinoooo! Come back sooon!! Good thing Germany's closer than Russia.
Will they really find work in Germany?
Who knows?...It's like an adventure. Hope springs eternal...
Yeah. How are you?
Yes.
Uh, yes!
No! No...
No, no. I-I-I understand completely. No problem. Y-you're busy. I-I-I...
That's what I thought.
I might call to check up on her, you know... to see if she's better?
Yes. That's fine! Thank you very much. A thousand times over!
Dallas. Korben Dallas.
Thank you so much for your help Mr...?
It was only an accident that we discovered them.
There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
I know. I was there when she arrived.
She's fine, really..don't you worry.. just needs some rest..she's had a very long trip.
I'm not hanging. I'm fixing my car --
'Bout what?
Miss Packard. How do you do?
That they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together --
Yes.
I do not want to.
I like this music.
Not all... but it feels like a kiss.
...Tomato?
Lois, someday --
Hi!
Okay, then. Go to it. And, Charlie
Is it about a pirate's daughter?
Are you to be my muse, ROSALINE?
I feel a scene coming on.
Can we maybe ask for more money on this?
...really? That's nice...are you lying?
It's Barry.
That's very nice. Thank you. Thank you for saying that. You're friends with my sister?
I know. I know. Help me, here. Look around.
How are you, Mr. Kross.
I've never treated you like a whore.
Vivian, life's not a fairy tale.
Vivian, I've thought about this a lot. This is the best solution.
Hey, sis.
Boston, huh? Did you get your degree up there?
Set one up.
Actually, I'm lookin' for Marietta's daughter, Lula. Her and 'er beau took off the other day. Marietta's real upset about it.
Real good, Chet... It's been awhile.
No... She's fine. Back home.
Sounds right... I'll check it out.
Yes I did.
Gee, that's an idea, Gallagher. That's an idea there. I wonder now...
Gently.
You could be something. I've got an idea, Gallagher. Let's get this set. That's a great idea for a play. Pal, get me a cigarette, will you?
Sorry, pard. Wouldn't want you to get an honor violation.
I can't risk it.
You should have told them he'd disappeared.
Okay, let me have this.
Aren't you going to have one?
"That"! This is not a "that"...
Pilar--
Whoa, this was a mistake.
Uh-huh.
Will do.
Well, what's your idea of love? Chains?
Sorry to interrupt. Your dad sent me.
And - uh - I guess, 'goodnight'.
Aw, listen Babe, I can't let you quit now. You're not going through with this thing, are you?
-- Last night we said a great many things. You said I was to do the thinking for both of us. Well, I've done a lot of it since then and it all adds up to one thing. You're getting on that plane with Victor where you belong.
Neither!
It's a lie! You're a deserter! You're an impostor, sir; Your lies and folly have confirmed this to me. You pretend to carry dispatches to a general who has been dead these ten months; you have an uncle who is an ambassador and whose name you don't know. Will you join and take the bounty, sir, or will you be given up?
Sir, I'm a British officer.
I'm afraid Major Strasser would insist.
I'm saying it because it's true. Inside of us we both know you belong with Victor. You're part of his work, the thing that keeps him going. If that plane leaves the ground and you're not with him, you'll regret it.
Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon, and for the rest of your life.
Whatta you mean, don't go? Whatta- whatta what's the matter? Whatta you expecting termites? What's the matter?
Well -- I don't. I mean I could. Or we could just talk.
Why don't I get it? Well -- I will then. If you'll excuse me.
Let me worry about that. Just leave the key under the mat and clear out.
To you, to me it's Thursday.
Looks quiet, y'know.
I didn't want no turkey anyway.
What's ya sister like to do?
Ice skate.
Try again, c'mon, try again.
Okay.
Do you always keep old newspapers around?
You have the right to an attorney.
I don't smoke.
Not so well, I regret to say. This business with the Maiden... it's caused him endless grief and torment. That's why he's entrusted me with the task of... shall we say...
What can we do to assist you?
Tea would be nice.
Don't you get smart with me, boy.
I guess I'll rob a bank.
How would you approach him? Hello, Mr. MacDougal, I'm Gin, would you steal a painting with me?
That's doable.
Why didn't I think of that?
With that computer--nobody better. Out there...it's different. You twisted your ankle stepping over a curb on Madison Avenue.
I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it.
"It's a Wonderful Life?"
"It's a Wonderful Life."
And the lights! Running lights, stealing stretchers...! You'll have us in jail.
Oh...
I understand.
I know.
Where's Mandalay?
Driving isn't the problem, it's remembering the right road.
No.
I suppose you're old enough to have heard of World War Two?
Barely, yes.
Yeah, I'm the best, baby.
Oh yeah, baby, I'll give it to you.
I do, baby, I do.
Yeah, that's right.
Then what?
Have you warned Professor Hikita?
I told you. Filet and salmon.
In 1944, five members of the O.S.S. -- the military espionage unit -- were ordered behind the German lines for the purpose of delivering 250,000 in gold to the French Underground. The five men --
I thought you hated Chardonnay.
I like all varietals. I just don't generally like the way they manipulate Chardonnay in California -- too much oak and secondary malolactic fermentation.
Whatever's closest, man. I need a glass.
Thanks, Jack. So do I. Here we are.
So what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?
Hey, Miles. I really hope your novel sells.
Gratin e, choucroute garnie, salade de pommes -- et un ballon de rouge.
I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
One more?
Miss Kubelik, one doesn't get to be a second administrative assistant around here unless he's a pretty good judge of character -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're tops. I mean, decency-wise -- and otherwise-wise. Cheers.
You couldn't help yourself. I mean, when you're having a drink with one man, you can't just suddenly walk out on him because you have another date with another man. You did the only decent thing.
I forgive you.
Well, as a matter of fact, I was rather hurt when you stood me up that night --
Didn't he say somethin'?
So how'd he finally nail you? Right there in the kitchen?
'We' did it? Whattaya mean? Didn't he force you?
And you never told nobody about it?
Yes--Me--in person!
Oh yeah? Seems to me, Reverend, you' more concerned 'bout your good. Guess it looks kind 'a bad, havin' me for a son-in-law.
Left them at the office.
I like worrying about you.
You don't know?
I don't know. I couldn't understand why you didn't tell me.
Poorly.
How is the patient faring?
Abbe de Coulmier!
Surely you'll grant me a final word.
I'm here.
Of course.
And my own.
My, my. You have exceeded my expectations.
Because she's sick.
Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me.
There's nothing fast enough to catch that. Forget it. It's over.
Public Enemy! All I'm trying to do is cheer us up. Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
Come on!
We'll take it!
It's the new --
IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
What are you doing?
I'm sorry.
Doesn't say what she's doing up here, but I don't think it has anything to do with us.
What did... what did I want to be?
You don't have a boyfriend or anyone... you know... like that?
Whoa.
Have you always wanted to be a lawyer?
I think she's after Glenn. The girl still with you?
Don't be an idiot!
Reggie -- stop!
Why? So you can kill me too? Tex is dead, I've seen him! He said Dyle did it!
I'm not Dyle -- you know that!
But Tex didn't -- he still thought -- !
You re funny.
I can't tell her. She's called off her wedding. She'll never speak to me again.
Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
I said -- uh -- I said even ten minutes -- is a long time -- to be away from you.
I'd like to spoil him just once. Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
I suppose you're right -- but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
You haven't even heard from him?
Mrs. Doyle?
Jeff again. Has Tom come in yet?
I'm afraid it is, Tess.
Does he know that?
I thought so. Where's your husband?
How long have you been married?
So you decided to go to America.
Yes, I'll bet.
I don't want to.
Wait! You are still a maid and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.
Look, I told you it was a... mistake to ever bring a live thing in the house.
Wanna hear a dirty joke?
What break? Huh? What break! Who am I to give breaks! I'm a fighter, you haul meat. You do what you do an' I do what I do best -- that's it -- that's life, man!
What can I do about it?
Christ, I been beggin' ya for a break until I'm sick inside.
It's never happened before. What makes you think it's happening now?
Yeah. I met this guy -- Gordon, Bert Gordon. He said I was. Born loser.
You wanna drink?
Sarah, do you think I'm a loser?
What's it so hot in here for?
It never was.
I'm grateful, Frank. How much? For the singer.
I've tried to do well by you, Jack. By both of us.
Frank. Fuck it. Okay?
If you'd like to assume more of the financial responsibilities, I'd be glad --
Two pianos isn't enough anymore, Jack.
What's that?
I thought maybe twenty percent. Look, with the additional bookings we'll come out ahead. The big hotels, they want a pretty girl with a big voice. We have to stay competitive, Jack.
Not that kind of history. The small stuff! About people you never heard of!
Nah.
What are you talking about?
Kathryn? Oh Christ, she got to you too?
Ronald, you don't know what you're talking about.
Ronald, I'm sorry.
Could I ask some questions?
No, this is the center of the universe. If I were living in Roman times, I would live in Rome, where else? Today, America is the Roman Empire and New York is Rome itself. John Lennon.
Well. Congratulations.
In that case... no...
You can't come to Southern Italy and not see the Blue Grotto.
Pretty good shot you are. What did she do?
What are you trying to tell me? That you did it?
Where did you hit her?
Whoever is keeping you waiting.
Yes, I am rather.
He must be very nice.
Never?
Like dancing?
Then you will please wait outside.
Do you like me better?
When I -- I'm ill, Flaemmchen -- It will not be long -- I'll not last long. Will you stay with me until...
Yes. It does.
Does that worry you?
I put a lot of effort into these things.
Why?
And a lot of time.
Ah, yes.
No.
I'm sure. But what else do you do with your time? Do you go to school?
My mother spoke to my Uncle Victor. He's in the Army and he fixed it up.
What about the draft?
You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
Colonel. Is uhm--is Otis in?
If it's too late--
I hate waiting. I could give you my word as a Spaniard.
No good. I've known too many Spaniards.
We'll wait until you're ready.
Your strong right arm's all the protection I'll need this night.
Again. Thank you.
It was a mess. I don't know how it got this way...
But you refused me, Dorothy.
Were you obliged to dance five times with Captain Best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?
And the last...?
Steerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath.
From Carl Heine's boat. All his were like this one, three-strand manila, new condition, braided in loops. Not bowlined like Miyamoto's.
Pretty darn clear.
Name's Norm. I live up in Pompano with my folks.
Uh, well... not exactly. You see, I exaggerated a little there.
But what can we do?... We have to accept.
He's cutting our throat...
Do we give the impression of people who are pressed for money?
We can wait.
Where's Ripley's safe at, he keep his valuables in.
All right, let's uphold it for another ten minutes.
Let's go upstairs, have a look at the man's bedroom. All right now, you and Mr. Buddy check the rooms down here. Look at the wall behind any pictures hanging on it. Look at the walls in the closets. The man has a safe, it's gonna be up there somewhere.
Oh, damn it! Damn it, damn it --
I don't know.
Not exactly.
Pull over.
You don't have to do it for a living.
Not really. This is pretty important.
Everybody ready? How do we look? Do we look okay?
Yes.
And now for that twentieth crack
Grayson - Anne's lawyer.
Gallagher, that guy just dropped by to give us a great opening for the third act.
You wounded me first, Marylin.
Hold on. Let me ask my friend. Stan, can I leave for a little while? My girlfriend is very --
Hi!
Oh...what's that?
God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
Your brother got mixed up with child procurers and tried to make this world a better place, Mrs De Moraes. And having rescued one little life he unwisely set out to repeat the exercise. You don t mess around with child procurers. Right now my guess is he s either on the run, held captive, or dead. I understand your misgivings, Mrs De Moraes. But I ve seen the boy and made telephone contact with the man Leon bought him from. If anyone knows what happened to your brother it will be that man. Which leads me to why I m here at such a late hour. I need 20,000, in cash, by 11 this morning.
You seem surprised. Could it be you don t think that badly of him after all? You needn t worry. It seems his motives were pure. From what I can make out he bought the boy to rescue him from further abuse.
Darling, if we're going to get anywhere someone has to keep his eyes open!
There s more. Your brother also purchased a young boy for 15,000.
It s a snuff movie. Prime paedophile material. I m told it retails at around 4,000. I see you don t require a definition.
I don't know what you're talkin' about.
I said you're fired. Go on -- get outta here.
You ever fly an F-14?
. Yeah!
Lucky charm.
Why, what's gonna happen?
No.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
No, not at all.
That's scary sounding.
... what?
Has done what?
I'm afraid that's what it is.
What is this, Swana?
Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower.
What?
That's fine.
Tell her you're on your way to France and will be back in four weeks.
Mossad?
I m calling about the puppies.
That's news to me. I'd better cable my wife.
Not yet. Say, where is this boat headed for?
Yeah? Have a brandy?
Thank you. Rick, there are many exit visas sold in this cafe, but we know that you have never sold one. That is the reason we permit you to remain open.
I thought it was because we let you win at roulette.
That is another reason. There is a man who's arrived in Casablanca on his way to America. He will offer a fortune to anyone who will furnish him with an exit visa.
Yeah? What's his name?
Victor Laszlo.
Victor Laszlo?
Rick, that is the first time I have ever seen you so impressed.
Well, he's succeeded in impressing half the world.
It is my duty to see that he doesn't impress the other half. Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.
I'm not sure, but...
Mrs. Bundy, you said something about Santa Cruz. About seagulls getting lost in the fog, and heading in for the lights.
I only know we've got to drive them away from town -- before they drive us away.
Oh... Thanks.
We'll make our own fog.
What would you think if someone played a kitchen table like it were a piano?
He's just tryin' to throw us off! They've got it, I tell you! Why don't we search their rooms?
We must talk, darling. It appears We have to... redefine the nature Of our association.
Well, then I guess it must have felt new because everything leading up to it was so different.
Ah?!
What room have you got?
I don't have one.
You don't have a room? Paolo? What did I just hear? I personally called you to reserve a room for my good friend Jacques Mayol and you treat him like a stranger?!
It's okay, Enzo. I'll go somewhere else.
I thought you were going to take him that night but...
I was talking to the cat.
At least, the cat comes back.
I don't want a million - I just want one. A perfect one.
I just found a picture of you.
Like shit.
Okay, okay. You win.
Thank you, sir!
Stop calling me 'sir! I ain't no officer. My name is Byron.
How did you get in here?
You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
We did not.
It was a gift from a client.
Set one side for Bel Air.
It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
Denial is not a river in Egypt.
You're in check.
No. Like this.
This one is particularly interesting. It's a hari-kari blade.
I see what you mean.
We are concerned about more than Casablanca. We know that every French province in Africa is honeycombed with traitors waiting for their chance, waiting, perhaps, for a leader.
I have no conviction, if that's what you mean. I blow with the wind, and the prevailing wind happens to be from Vichy.
And if it should change?
That might not have been such a good idea. They're making us fly out of a half-paved airfield. The real punishment is that I won't be back to the barracks till it's too late for dinner or coffee. So I guess it's goodbye for awhile.
Look, the other night, I want to apologize.
I sunk most of what I had into this condo, which devalued, and --
I mean, the other night was... I felt like you understood something I could barely even say, something way down deep in the murk -- -- but we have a company here to think about. I won't ever take advantage of you in that way again.
We're two people working together and we can't have an atmosphere.
You walked out on a job for me, and I won't ruin that.
This is cause for celebration. She'll probably charge half price for sex from now on.
Gary, how we doing, big stallion?
No, have fun first. Then laugh. Now, forget about marriage for a while. Go party.
As if that name, Shot from the deadly level of a gun did murder her, as that name's cursed hand did murder her kinsman.
I'll take care of myself --
I know. I'm a little bit nervous. Suddenly everything seems so easy. Carol, a load has been lifted.
Is Miss Scott staying here?
How about Miss Flintstone?
Now, now, Jack--that just ain't right.
I'm just waiting and seeing. Like you said.
You know eavesdropping is a very unattractive habit.
Okay, fine. Fine You backed me into a corner again. You're holding me hostage ...
Will you lead me to her?
Course we care. What good's the world locked in a season of death. Frozen up, no folks to scare out of their wits on a summer's night; no babies to tickle; no more spells to cast... Think that's an enjoyable prospect?
There must be an answer somewhere.
If ye want more tricks, I'm your man, but for big questions ye must go elsewhere.
Don't you care about what's happened?
Someone worthy of respect, lad. She be a water spirit, lives in a bog down at sea-side. Hideous creature to look at, even by my doubtful standards; devours little children, she does, when she can catch them.
How is it this hag knows the truth?
Jenny Greenteeth? Who's she?
Sorry, can you give us a moment?
I've been calling for days!
Well, here's your hat, what's your hurry? All right, Mother, old Building and Loan pal, I think I'll go out and find a girl and do a little passionate necking.
You talk as if I were Asta.
I never saw him before.
What'd he think it was to you?
Ask him. I don't know.
Nothing.
I'm asking you.
Keep on asking.
Cut that out. Just because I'm married - there's no reason for that.
Well, if she doesn't want to come, I'll come down alone.
I should have told you why I broke up with you. I was a coward. You deserve to know.
Shall we draw up the papers, or is our handshake good enough?
I know this. Bach. F Minor Concerto. It's one of my favorites.
Your parents arranged the visit to my office?
That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
Well...
Well, it was just fabulous! I'm, I, you know...
Yes! I was abso-- And...w- what...made you think of that climax scene where the, where the... architect is walking home with his actress girlfriend and-and the ex- wife who's schizophrenic jumps out of the bushes and stabs him to death?
Then who does?
And stop threatening that boy. He doesn't have the money. Mrs. Lampert doesn't either.
I don't know, Herman -- maybe you do.
Or you -- Or you --
I work at Kentucky Fried Chicken.
I thought so.
It was okay?
Gotta get home. How could she do this to me? How could she not care about what we meant to each other. What a fuck! What a fucking monster she is!
In the world.
It's so cool. You're by far the most sensational person in the room.
How could she have done this to me? How could anyone do this to anyone?
Getting me out of Glades for starters.
And who watches your back?
But you still think you can get the diamonds fore they do?
I wasn't asking permission.
They want to go tonight, before Glenn gets in any trouble, opens his big mouth.
Shhh. Shhh.
I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people.
Have we still got power?
The past fifteen minutes. It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again.
It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise...
It may not be last week again for a long long time.
Do you want to try your father again?
My name is Clarence, and what is yours?
You shoulda saw the first original uncut version of the "Streetfighter". It was the only movie up to that time rated X for violence. But we just saw the R.
I put an ad on a computer bulletin board. I log on at the library so I can't be traced.
I will.
Yeah, it's pretty relevant considering my situation.
Reading.
Of Human Bondage.
Jesus...Jesus!
You are, you are my only connection to the world!
But who? Where did you meet him?
Who is it?
Can you not be violent?
It was a mistake.
Your story was Rigfort's baby. We were scooped! We've got nothing. Zippo. You totally and completely screwed both of us.
You gotta admire the man's determination.
Absolutely.
See ya, Kate.
Please don't waste my time, Comrade. Do your duty. Good-by.
I don't understand.
Elaine.
Judy--we're ready for you now.
What?
What makes you think he hates you, Judy?
He makes you feel pretty unhappy?
It's not me, moron.
Want to join me in some cartwheels?
No. I'd feel stupid.
This is really nice. Makes me feel like a kid. I want to do somersaults .
With God?
Maude, do you pray?
Shit. What have I done? Stall them! I'll meet you out back.
He'll love it.
I just took the ho to Burger King, alright.
You amaze me.
No, that's fine. It's not often one has the opportunity to adios the plates of a major Hollywood star. It was a thrill for me. How is he?
Two crab dinners and pitcher of cold beer. Baked or fries?
Is this Friedman, Martin? Come on, scumbag. You ve reached your sell- by date. Tell me if this is Friedman, where he is in Los Angeles and what name he s using?
Yes!
That's right?
I've never met anyone like you in my life.
Wow.
She's right?!
Don't be an asshole, Richard. They're gonna kill you.
You betcha.
Now, that's all right, isn't it?
I get mad for a lot of other guys besides myself I get mad for a guy named Washington! And a guy named Jefferson and Lincoln. Lighthouses, John! Lighthouses in a foggy world! You know what I mean?
We still got a few tricks up our sleeves.
What happened?
What are you doing fooling around in here?
Oh, but you didn't engage me, sir.
Drunk, sir?
Well, if it isn't the Ripper hisself.
Yes.
Change?
A dollar forty--out of the two dollars I gave you.
Good luck, Richard.
I believe what he said.
I wouldn't take that too seriously.
What is it, Reggie -- what's he saying?
He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
What'd he say?
I'll tell her you were here.
Yes -- that's right.
I'm sorry about how we --
Yes.
You were! You are ! It was fantastic.
Did you ever do one on Wayne Gacy?
Are those my suits?
The episode we did on Mickey and Mallory was one of our most popular ones.
Just tell me what's really going on. I think we know each other well enough for me to expect that.
I don't know what it is, but I won't use it. Is she entertaining you?
Hello?
Here... to help pay Jeanne's ransom. All the Captains gave what they could, as well as the citizens of Orleans and the other towns she saved...
Yes, that s it...yes, we went to high school together.
Adelle?
Maybe I could talk to Bud Ellis. He might have a job for you at his filling station.
Someone else c'n take your confession.
Maybe she's in the show--One of the troupers--did you ever think of that?
I'll be seeing you.
I do, but I won't tell you just yet. Meet me in the chapel at eight-thirty, right before lock-down.
I figured out exactly why it is I'm so hung up on getting a chance at weekend anchor...It's because if I do that well, they'll pay me more, treat me great and my life will be better. That's why.
You can!
Telegrams.
There's one coming.
I'll try.
You're good at riddles... Find the ring and the spell is broken.
And did you?
Nay. It was lost. When I came up for air the pond was frozen over.
That's it then... the ring!
You must find the ring... It completes the cycle; answers the riddle...
Contain it and get back to me.
What do you mean by 'contain?'
Shermin, I want you and Bell to start looking for the one on the ground.
We'll need a lot of help, George. You could hide an army up here.
I'm going to the White House right now. I'll try and get you everything you need.
Wait, wait... What are my orders if we find this thing?
There's a hawk around. They're scared tonight.
Sure I do.
You were out running this morning, sticking to your routine, anybody happened to notice. But you only did a couple of miles instead of your usual five. Saving yourself for the main event. Then I see you inside eating ten pounds of macaroni. Carbohydrates for endurance.
What?
You get that, Lyman?
Wrong.
Do you think she killed Johnny Boz?
Thank you.
He wants to show now.
Call him -- I mean it can wait, right?
I don't know. At a certain point it was so off the chart bad -- it got funny. My central nervous system was telling me something. Jane -- sweat running down my face -- makeup falling into my eyes -- people turning this fusillade of blow dryers on me -- all so I could read introductions to other people who were covering stories which is what I like to do anyway. And I'm chipper because you finally showed up. I thought I'd cook for us. Tequila and eggs sound good?
No, nice ones worried that I was having a heart attack.
I'm not kidding.
No!!!!!
Then express yourself, Bob.
Yes?
Well...I'm -- uh, Joe. And you're Susan. And I - uh - have this weak feeling in my knees --
Faster. And I want the scent from underneath your ears and the taste of your lips and the touch of your tongue to stay with me -- forever.
Where are you going? To him? Is that it? To be a whore to that gutter rat?
All by yourself?
I uh... ha, ha... I don't think I ever met a lady quite like yourself and I appreciate all the pains you've gone through to --
You mean you hauled him all the way out here? Just like that?
Uh, I'm Tom Booker. Your mother around?
IIIIIIIIIII don't want to hurt anything ever, but what I'm talking about is -- have you ever held a little puppy or a little kitten and it's just the cutest, softest, most precious thing in the world and out of the blue you get this feeling in your gut and all you wanna do is squeeze it. Just fuckin squeeze the shit out of it. To take a little puppy and smash its skull...just so precious, so beautiful. Just so god damn wonderful and cute you wanna smack it and kick it and love it. Fuck. I don't know. I don't know. And you, you.....I'm looking at you and I just....your face is so beautiful I just wanna smash it, just smash it with a sledgehammer and squeeze it...you're so pretty.
Do you wanna have sex?
I know what you mean, I know what you mean, I get this feeling --
What's that? What is that that you're doing?
I am. Good day. Madam.
Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels?
Ahhh, but I really do want those birds.
I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers.
No, but your little prank did. The judge should have put you behind bars!
Hello, Mollie.
Well, if she's gonna write fiction, there's nothing like being a reporter.
She says she's gonna write fiction.
No! I never hear it! Maybe. Sometimes. I don't know. But I won't let it bother me.
Me? Of course not. HANNAH There's things Holly wrote about in her script about us that are so...personal they could only have come from you.
No.
Hannah, my head is throbbing. HANNAH You never want to talk about it. I-- Every time I bring it up, you- you change the subject. What is it? Do you-- We're communicating less and less. You sleep with me less and less.
Is this dangerous or anything?
No more than the usual.
Uh --Mr. Alexander?
Highly suspect.
What?
I'm a work in progress.
Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true.
I was catching up with Bob Destephano.
No. I think I said something eloquent like, "So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know. What do you think?"
Well that's the eye right there. Money. And all the power and misery it brings with it. It's a plot to take over the world. The Master Conspiracy. Can take a lifetime to pull off.
Oh, well, maybe to the untrained eye. Hmm... Ahh... Ooooo...
More about life on Mars. From a rock they found on the South Pole. Explain that one to me. But maybe we should go to Mars and find out? How much do you think that's going to cost?
Yeah. I think so.
I have no idea.
Just like in Detroit, only skinnier.
You goin' out?
That's a pretty amazing story.
Well, she's a pretty amazing girl. What are women like out here?
And here we are.
Then say you'll spend Dollar Night at the track with me.
Come on -- the ponies, the flat beer, you with money in your eyes, me with my hand on your ass...
No.
Seven-thirty?
What, what?
No. So. Is it working out with Ian?
Feel free.
Mr. Thomerson, I...
What's that, pardner?
Bandit I, let me offer my heartiest congratulations and a piece of advice.
Am I going mad or did the word "think" escape your lips? You were not hired for your brains, you hippopotamic land mass.
Thanks, much. Good luck with the genital tucking.
No thanks. I'm looking for a girl named Valerie who also smells like coconuts.
Hey.
Adrian?
Carl who?
And you let them come up. You don't try to make the bust yourself. You understand?
Now you see Foley and this guy Bragg come in behind us, whatta you do?
How's that?
You look pretty good for a corpse.
Stretch out under the seat, Miss.
It's a nice place owned by an old couple named Wyatt.
No, that's your problem, Frank. You get around one of these assholes and you turn into a fucking three-year-old.
Confucious says, The way out is through the door. There's a truck. There's your door.
Are you okay? You want some help?
You're limping.
You are leaving, aren't you?
When I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in Paris?
So we can finally talk?
Auxiliary field at Haleiwa, ten miles north of here.
But no intention of selling them. One would think if sentiment wouldn't persuade him, money would.
He suggested I ask you.
Yes. He said, "Ask your wife." I don't know why he said that.
What's there?
Ilsa, I --
Six P-40's.
No.
I've heard just about enough of this lunacy! Go to your room!
Sparrin'?
I know ya need sparrin' partners -- I'm very available.
Rocky.
No -- Just me.
Absolutely -- Sparrin' with the Champ would be an honor -- y'know what?
True.
Okay, maybe she is psychic. Let's go eat!
Mt. McKinley. It's also the highest point in North America.
Yeah?
That would knock my father out.
He's a Windows guy then, huh?
Oh, yes. It would probably kill him.
Well, I think Windows stink. What do you think of that?
Yes. He likes windows.
Hi.
Nothing for him! He's being repressed.
Aaah, it's the same as always...poor mope's just wishin' he was me.
I've been trying to get through to the head guy - the nightmare god - what's his name?
My Fellow Americans. I have a dream. Let us boldly go where no man has gone before.
... The way she moves.
Well we're off and running. Just Acquired us a quarter-interest in The game at the Oriental.
She's not like the others. She can't stand to be away from the sea.
Like I said, baby - I'll write you.
What do you take me for?
You should have someone look after you.
It's a diary.
What's this?
Do we have anything on the budget today?
Mother . . .
Well, sure I do.
Today, over at the house.
No, listen to me. You're the best in the country, don't you understand? It's like a pyramid. It starts out with everybody, and it narrows through your life and through everything, and all the hoopla and the competition narrows it down to one brilliant person who is so special that they celebrate you on two continents. And it's you. So tell me something, where's the flaw in that? There is no flaw.
Yes, that's good. Until he meets
Mercutio good name.
No, I...
Okay, how much time do you need? I mean, you know, I mean you'll be leaving in a little while, so that's answered some questions.
No, no, don't go in there.
You mean your NOT going to spring me?
Good morning.
Either you're a liar or you are a fool.
A kind of freedom.
So am I.
It's just my heart.
Oh, yes, there've been a lot of them around here already. Strangest kind of people. Salesmen - politicians - moochers - all want something. I haven't had a minute to myself. Haven't seen Grant's Tomb yet.
What did you say? What did you do?
You re too good for him.
I don t know.
Santa Claus?
Oh. Is that how you met him?
Of course you shouldn't. You don't know how to do it. Dunking's an art. Don't let it soak so long. A dip and plop, into your mouth. If you let it soak so long, it'll get soft and fall off. It's all a matter of timing. I ought to write a book about it.
Just goes to show you. Twenty millions and you don't know how to dunk.
No, I love Annie. We had a lot of good times, didn t we?
Nothing sticks to slime, Emily. This should cover what you lent me.
Could that be Camden Market?
Would you know where I might reach her?
I know his work better than I know him.
What about his girlfriend?
It's Susan's cooking, Claire. That's why Uncle James lets them stay.
-- yeah that would be great, if I was gonna go but I'm not exactly sure, I have so much goin on here -- A lot depends on this thing I might do here and if that happens I can't go and if it doesn't happen then I probably will, but I doubt it.
-- I'm probably not gonna go though.
I was, yeah, I was thinking about going there for business --
That's great -- Hawaii. I was thinking about going there.
Are you guys hurt?
Yeah Lloyd. What are your plans for the future?
Spend as much time as possible with Diane before she leaves.
Like sticking his nose into other people's business.
Oh yeah...
Hi. It's a pleasure. I'm very grateful for the way you took in my girls here. I bet you were surprised when they just showed up out of nowhere.
They were kidding you.
Come where?
For how long?
And he's never once attempted escape?
A man of his notoriety? He wouldn't last a day on the streets without capture.
His wife's?
Why is he in your care, and not a proper prison?
His wife's influence.
Tomorrow evening, nine. East River Drive and 73rd Street.
Suppose I meet you there a half hour before.
It probably has the Dumper's name. It might give us some kind of new lead. I want a look at it anyhow.
All right, but I'm going to see that list.
Just send me a money order.
No, I'd -- like to be in on it.
She's beautiful -- isn't she?
Sorry.
No thanks -- keeping my head clear.
A drink, Baron -- A Louisiana flip?
Oh -- here you are, Baron. A drink -- A Louisiana flip?
Hello -- sorry I'm late.
A little strange, Baron.
Hello, Mr. Kringelein. How do you feel now?
Of course.
Bob will be very happy.
Not bad for eleven dollars a day.
Fan works.
Let's get a sandwich and find out about some work.
Yeah?
I'm not talking to you. You don't have any friends.
Yeah, I know. Girls mature faster than guys. But last night, I was the one who put on the brakes. And you know why?
I can? Okay. Okay...
You should have been a poet.
Maude.
Here.
You own this place?
And what did she do?
Ah forget it, kid, ya don't have to explain to me. He's a little person. He's nothing. Like I say, ordinarily it would just be a nuisance. But it seems -- well, there was a spy in the company...
How's that, Sid?
Mm. Ordinarily I wouldn't bother you with it, but -- this is embarrassing, kid -- it seems to concern you directly.
You wanna get unhaunted?
Yeah.
With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
Yeah.
He don't got no right to live.
Ah -- I see. No, I'm afraid mine are the O'Higgins of Watertown.
Which O'Higgins do you know? For I have never heard your name mentioned in my family.
I am only sorry that I was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.
In case they try to kill us. I don't know, what do you want me to say?
In case.
What the fuck did you bring that for.
Do you really mean it?
I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
That's it.
Listen, Edie, am I going to see you again?
That's a chance we have to take.
Hey, another one for me and another one for the lady.
Can I buy you another drink?
Thanks for the, uh, for the breakfast.
Can I sit down?
Out. I've got things to do.
I've told you enough.
Here you are.
Go back to the bus and reroute the call.
I suppose. Thanks.
Ever seen an uncut diamond, Studs? They look like plain old rocks.
Everything on it?
No, see, I want both of us to get crazy. We should both be cutting loose. I mean, this is our last chance. This is our week! It should be something we share.
Yes they are. And I'm serious. Do not fuck with me. I am going to get laid before I settle down on Saturday. Do you read me?
Sure, big guy. Whatever you say. It's your party. I'm sorry I'm in the way and dragging you down. Maybe you'd have a better time on your own. You take the car. I'll catch the train back.
But where in the head? Not the chin, I hope.
Where?
Shoot Sailor in the head with a gun... Now I'm beginning to get it... You want me to shoot Sailor in the head with a gun.
Shoot him? Like with a gun?
Where? In the leg?
Funny -- you look married.
I'm not married.
Uh... basement I think...
If it was some poor mojado, swam across at night, got lost in the scrub and starved out there, we wouldn't go any further. But this is a formerly prominent citizen.
Just wondering.
He swore by it. What?
I think-I think there's too much burden placed on the orgasm, you know, to make up for empty areas in life.
Uh, I hate to tell yuh, this is nineteen seventy-five, you know that "neat" went out, I would say, at the turn of the century. Who-who are-who are those photos on the wall?
Sylvia Plath.
Interesting poetess whose tragic suicide was misinterpreted as romantic, by the college-girl mentality.
Oh, sorry.
Neat?
How many B-average students do you think they take at West Point?
Thank you, Mr. Dobisch.
'Bout seven.
Don't . . . George?
What did . . .
But your voice Have they dropped?
Mr. Pope! Mr. Phillips! Welcome, George Bryan! James Armitage! Sam! My pretty one! Are you ready to fall in love again?
Mercutio
Like family, huh?
Don't be silly.
Bontecou Day. Going to close with Big John -- Look at you, Bill, all cool as a cat and over at Bontecou's, I'll bet he's shitting in his pants.
See how she breezed out of here. Like she had wings. Funny thing But I can't really remember how She looked. I can remember parts Of her clear as crystal, her Mouth, her walk, how she shut her Eyes when she laughed, little Bits and pieces, but not the Whole package. Can't put it Together for some reason.
Cards in spades. I'm in love with Every second of her life. Hell, I'll probably love her when I'm dust.
Well, I'm on the bum; I'll buy him a couple of drinks and tell him my troubles. But not tonight. If you won't drink with me, I'll drink alone, tonight.
It would be an added stress to his heart.
Increase his heart rate.
It would be the same as shooting a gun at him.
She didn't wanna miss out on anything...especially motherhood...it got to be a real problem with us.
What family? We never heard from them. I sold her house for them, made them money.
Read it.
I already did.
Humiliations galore!
Sorry, Mom!
Yeah. Let's dig in!
Well, we'll be going up in two years. We'll know then. I'm very hopeful.
You mean leave the magazine?
For what?
That's what I'm afraid of. Could you see me -- driving down to the fashion salon in a jeep -- wearing combat boots and a three day beard?
Look, even if it was nearer, that's just not what I do. I give clinics. And I'm not even doing them for a while. I'm heading back to Montana right now. I got a ranch to take care of...
Let's not talk any more nonsense, huh?
Sure. Look! You sing it over again, and I'll do "Humoresque" with you.
Go ask him, why don't you ? Ask him yourself.
Have a seat. I'm trying to find out just what happened to Joey Doyle. Maybe you can help.
I like it. It's good for you. Besides, you start drinking whisky gambling and it gives you an excuse for losing. That's something you don't need -- an excuse for losing. How did you make out in the poker game?
I lost twenty bucks.
Only when I work.
Yeah? Why?
I'm buyin'.
Thought you only drank milk.
Bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Two.
Poker's not your game.
What is?
Shouldn't you be taking notes?
Tell me about your vision of the reunion.
Say more.
They'll have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs.... made themselves a part of something. And they can talk about what they do. What am I going to say? "I killed the President of Paraguay with a fork."
How do you know?
You needn't be so frank with me about your work.
Why not. I trust you. You couldn't turn me in because of Doctor-Patient privilege... and I don't want to be "withholding"... and I know where you live.
A man of honor dies, but never apologizes. I'll see the captain hanged before I apologize.
Yeah. You?
...Shit!
It's my wife.
I'm not going.
One reason... I want to stay the only one left alive.
I mean my future.. my ex.. My future ex.. if she sees you here I'm finished. She hates you guys. It's what killed us in the first place. Please...
All in one tape?
They won't squawk--they're professionals.
Well, if that's the case, you're sure of winning the first couple of hands--But what about after that?
That is a skill!
And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
It's people with no lives watching other people's fake lives.
They're new to us...
Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left. Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact...
Dad, I...
You may not realize it, Miss Kubelik, but I'm in the top ten -- efficiency-wise and this may be the day -- promotion-wise.
Why not? Now that they're kicking me upstairs --
I'd love to hear them. Maybe we could have lunch in the cafeteria sometime -- or some evening, after work --
But we can't do that unless she admits to blasphemy...
It is not for us to burn her, my lord. That is your prerogative.
All in . . .
Men worked for Santa Anna down there, waited out the Civil War. The land wasn't much to feed people on, so in 1870 they come north and put up at Fort Duncan and the men joined up what was called the Seminole Negro Indian Scouts. Best trackers either side of the border. Bandits, rustlers, Texas rednecks, Kiowa, Comanche--
They fought against the Indians?
So they stayed in Florida?
They got tired of fighting, went to the Indian Territories for a while. But the slave-raiders were on 'em even there, and one night they packed up and nearly the whole band rode down to Mexico. Crossed at Eagle Pass.
The Trail of Tears.
They teaching that now? Good. Only a couple of 'em held out--this man, John Horse, and his friend Wild Cat, and a fella name of Osceola. Army put all of them in prison and Osceola died, but them other two escaped and put together a fighting band and held out another ten, fifteen years. Beat Zach Taylor and a thousand troops at Lake Okeechobee.
He was part of the Seminole Nation, got pushed down into the Everglades in pioneer days. African people who run off from the slaveholders hooked up with them, married up, had children. When the Spanish give up Florida, the U.S.Army come down to move all them Indian peoples off to Oklahoma--
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous. I mean it's -- it's pretty hard to be suave when you're --
What?
I haven't. No.
Very chic. Anyway, you don't have anything else, do you?
To calm your anxiety.
Why?
I'll be right back.
I need to see Snow.
I'll just be a minute.
Come on inna dining room.
Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
Please.
A mountain curved like a woman's back, a plateau the shape of an ear.
Oh, you're a great writer, Lois, nobody doubts that.
Rose Rose?
Feel better now?
I went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss. Boy, she's in a bad way.
No. You listen. I had my doubts about you from the beginning
In case you've forgotten, we're being paid to be here. So it might be nice if you conducted yourself with a certain amount of decency.
Where is she?
Why don't you come home with me? I mean nobody's home at my house--and I'm not tired, are you? I don't have many--people I can talk to.
Who has?
Jesus. What, I live in a palace, right? I have guests here.
Hey, watch your mouth -- she's a great gal. I'm the dumbshit for lying to her.
What does take care of him mean? Do you want me to give him food or some clothing?
Big is the key word, and I'm telling you I want it bad.
Get rid of him?
How would I do that? Send him on a trip - like maybe to Hawaii?
Just tell me what you want.
D D Mattress Man.
I was great, eh?
YOU FUCK OFF. YOU FUCK OFF AND DIE I WILL HURT YOU FOR HURTING HER. YOU HURT HER.
Somewhere in Utah.
Enzo drop it, I'll find something.
Not only is Jacques Mayol a very special friend, but he happens to be one of the best divers in the world! And you're throwing him out! Are you crazy, or what? Stupido!
My very best to Johnnie... Bless his soul.
...or from the cut on his hand. Which is more probable?
And you were generally experienced in training men for hand-to-hand combat.
So. Wide cross-section of men to evaluate. And the day that the defendant volunteered for this... demonstration. Did you find him eager?
Your friends would. Your dad would kill me with a machete.
Forgive my blood haste, Jimmy Squarefoot, but I want no more surprises from Couer de Noir.
Much good we do the world, for all our noble quest...
But seem to have gotten lost on the way.
Aye. We be on a quest to set the world aright --
Course it's too bad about your dad.
How did it happen?
I would as soon destroy a stained glass window as an artist like yourself. However, since I can't have you following me either --
Finish him, finish him. Your way.
Jesus Christ!
Relax, we brought the cash.
I didn't think so. So, give me an example of a stupid person doing a stupid thing. Not being stupid, you're equipped to recognize it.
Are we gonna do business here, or not?
No, that's ignorant. They just don't know any better.
That's what I thought. You better give me another example.
All right... lemme see... okay, new Burger King opens up. These assholes get excited and start lining up. Like it's some five star restaurant. The place is mobbed. Right?
I figured I'd get, uh, Frederick and Dusty together.
Sammy's?
You were great.
That sounds like me.
You were great.
No you didn't.
Marylin! Listen to me.
The Massey pre-nup has never been pene -- successfully challenged.
Do you think I'm going to end up like Herb Myerson, with a colostomy bag instead of a family?
Da Vinci?
Is this your first film?
Of course it is. Any favourite among the 22?
It's a lie!
Yeah. Anyway, there aren't any photographers around.
Yeah, I guess so. What puzzles me is why people seem to get so much pleasure out of hurting each other. Why don't they try liking each other once in a while?
You know.
Oh, that
What's that?
Yes, she did.
Nothing
So how's that work, a wanted felon socializing with a U.S. Marshal?
I saw Karen Sisco.
And she saw you?
I didn't see where you was pickin' this mornin', Homer, but you musta worked up a big appetite. You look like you're serious about gettin' to your lunch today!
It was a terrible evening.
Yeah, really. You do. You do.
So they think he left it with you.
That's all.
Go on.
I have some parsnip stew from last week. If I just peel the skin off, it'll be perfect.
I don't know. 'Guess I belong here more than there.
Yeah. Knocked around for a couple of months after the Army. You been there?
Well, it ain't that good up there neither. Might as well make it here. 'Course I ain't really makin' it now.
Think again--
More Light and light, more dark and dark our woes.
I think you gave me the wrong one.
It was blank. Nothing on it. You gave me the wrong one.
So what'd I miss?
I cranked it all the way up. Nothing but hum.
Let me be taken, let me be put to death. I have more care to stay then will to go. Come death, Welcome, Juliet wills it so. How is't my soul? Let us talk it is not day.
What went off?
This tear bomb went off unexpectedly in the hands of Sheriff Hartman's Bombing Squad.
If the Mayor wants me, he knows where I am.
No, I tell you! Nobody knows where he got it.
Call you back.
The Crime Commission has offered a reward of ten thousand dollars for Williams' capture.
Yeah. Yeah, it's a gift.
Whatever.
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I registered as Mr. and Mrs.
I'm here tellin' ya to be very smart with this shot. Like the Bible sez, ya don't get no second chance.
Whatta' those?
Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
No. But he hands them over.
You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
Yes, you do. Now concentrate.
Wait... wait ! Are you sure?
Get more coffee.
Tell me again -- what's my name?
And what happened to you?
I think you been stayin' up too late at night, Homer.
Look at all them other fighters. Real good boys. Good records. Colorful. Fight their hearts out for peanuts -- But who cared? Nobody. They got it shoved in their back door. Nobody ever give them a shot at the title...
Security.
When the Duke of Courland brought fourteen lackeys each with bags of florins, and challenged our bank to play against the sealed bags, what did we ask?
Sir, we have but eighty thousand florins in bank, or two hundred thousand at three months; if your highness' bags do not contain more than eight thousand, we will meet you.
Charming Schuvaloff.
Actually, my name is Craig Schwartz, Dr. Lester.
Dark Valdez.
Black-eyed Sczortarska.
Come in, Mr. Juarez. I'd stand, but, well, you know.
Hello, Mimi.
Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the truth.
GOT 'EM. GOT GOOD TONE.
I GOT ONE COMING UP.
ON THE NOSE?
You're crazy! You can't do that!
Tell him you're Babe Bennett? Tell him you've been making a stooge out of him?
Yeah? I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me.
You know what we're going to do? We're going to shoot the works. A whole week in New York. A whole week in Bermuda. The highest hotels the oldest champagne the richest caviar the hottest music, and the prettiest wife!
Miss Kubelik, I don't think that's such a good idea.
Maybe I will.
What's the matter with you?
For what?
Your mother will want to kiss me? Give me back my letters. That's the breaks I get. It's the mothers that are always grateful to me. Here.
Thanks, I like it. I think.
I love you. You know I lo-ove you, I-I love you. I-I have to invent- Of course I love you.
That's the key question.
You- Do you love me?
I-uh, love is, uh, is too weak a word for what...
I know you've only known me a short while.
But that was her order!
It was the owl. Believe me, love, it was the owl.
The little O'Brien girl, of course - the one you suggested in the story.
Gallagher, what are you going to do - tell me how to write a play?
There's nothing sudden about that He's always loved the girl, but he was such a sap he didn't have sense enough to tell her. Well, that's all right - we can fix that. He will go to the little O'Brien girl, and - here, I'll show you.
Oh, let Henslowe wait.
But Marylin, you know a divorce would ruin me right now. Everything I have -- everything we have -- is tied up in my business. The business is my entire life.
Look, Marylin, can't we have a civilized discussion about this?
We had a leak in the bathroom. He fixed it.
Marylin?
He was wearing a suit.
It tried to pin down what the attraction is after all these years. It covers the whole spectrum of fans, the people who love his music, the people who grew up with him, the artists he inspired - Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, and the fanatics, like these guys. I don't know about you, but they give me the creeps.
No, honey. No, he's not here.
I don't know... it didn't feel right. I'm going to bed. I'm tired.
What?
I'm sure he'll forgive you.
Excuse me?
Well -- I, uh, that is to say Mr. Dumbarton -- would like you to uh, neutralize a, uh, business associate by the name of Marylin Rexroth Doyle Massey uh Dumbart -- uh, Massey.
Here's her picture...
Mr. Dumbarton is, yes.
Excuse me, but this is as arousing as a stroll through the Vatican.
You saw wrong.
Are you hungry?
We vetoed that?
Call Bob and Reed. Tell them I need them immediately.
But it's ten-thirty at night.
What the hell is this ?
What the hell is this?
No...
The Washington Post.
I'm not listening!
We were attacked by a werewolf.
Warn me? Will you get out of here, you meat loaf?
David, now I know this may be hard for you, but I have to warn you.
If you love me so much, Jack, you'll realize how disconcerting it is to share one's breakfast with the living dead!
I'm a grisly sight, it's true; but I love you and that's why I'm here. You've got to know.
I'm going completely crazy.
Life mocks me even in death.
What?!
David!
I know, sugar... But while the place was burnin'... Before Santos came out - I pitched some rocks at the second floor windows case anyone was upstairs sleepin'... Afterwards... When I met you, I always liked to think I mighta saved your life.
What are you talking about?
Oh well... branding will do that to you.
We all got a secret side, baby. Hope you don't think I been lyin' to you 'bout other things, sugar.
I thought you guys were going to call me.
When I was first married.
If I stayed out past ten with the guys she'd go into her Madame Butterfly routine--
Is that what you want?
I'm shootin' pool, Fats. When I miss you can shoot.
Well, I don't know what you had in mind, but I hope you're happy. I put myself on the line for you, my reputation, and you're making me look like an idiot.
Let me try this, goddamnit! SHE'S BEEN DOING IT ALL WEEK, SHE CAN DO IT NOW!
No! Let me try this!
No! No problem, there is no... What is the problem? Just do that... thing... you do! Come on! You drove me nuts with this for three days, now do it!
You don't do what I say... I'll waste you myself. Got it?
Baker. Jack Baker.
Come on, Ed.
He doesn't bite.
And don't forget all the bad times you had with Victoria. How small she make you feel. That's why you had the affair in the first place.
It must be the most marvelous supper. We may not eat it, but it must be marvelous.
No! Bad luck! Your Ma and I been married fifty-two years an nobody died. You were married, what, two years, and somebody is dead. Don't get married again, Loretta. It don't work out for you. Who's the man?
Oh yes.
Bad time?
Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in.
I'm sorry that I'm not taking you.
So am I, Frank.
Thanks for being on time... Carol, the waitress, this is Simon, the fag.
I, uh... I was... attacked. Walked in on people robbing me. I was hospitalized. I almost died.
Let's do the small talk in the car. Load up.
I was going to do that for you.
That's me.
See ya, Kate.
Trucker coffee. It's three times stronger. Good for a hundred miles. That, a coupla perks, and you can leap tall buildings in a single bound.
No. The fetus was dead. Her uterus was virtually disintegrating --my stitches pulled right through the tissue!
There was no visible wound?
This is making me incredibly angry.
Go away.
Will you sign the register, please?
Your name was picked.
You're overestimating yourself again. What's worse, this time you're overestimating me.
For God's sake, the only way I can get from one elevator to the other is to jump.
What about in terms of medical expenses? 250,000 doesn't come close to what this family's gonna have to spend on doctors.
250,000?
You're kidding, right? Look at these readings for Christ's sake. PG E's own technicians documented toxic levels of hexavalent chromium in those test wells, on numerous occasions.
Wait a minute -- I thought we were negotiating here.
I need to tell you something. I didn't know what it was to lose somebody, to see death and find how much it scares you. That you haven't lived and loved enough. I didn't understand. Forgive me.
Of course I forgive you. I know what you feel for Danny is real. And your choice is your choice.
Thanks, Pal. You saved my life.
Drink up! This is a celebration. This is the day we received word we were gonna make television history. We're gonna have the first sit down, in depth interview with the most charismatic serial killer ever, one day before he's being shipped to a mental hospital for the rest of his life. This is one of those golden moments that happens maybe only four times in a lucky journalist's career. This is Wallace with Noriega, this is Elton John confessing his bi-sexuality to the Rolling Stone, this is the tearful reporting of the Hindenberg disaster, this is Truffaut setting the record straight on Hitchcock, this is a Robert Capa photo, this is Woodward and Bernstien meeting Deep Throat in an underground parking lot, this is John Reid reporting 'The Ten Days That Shook The World', this is the hippies' bloody palms at Kent State, the Maysles brothers at Altamont, this is the Nixon Frost interviews...
We got tonight and tomorrow to get our shit together. The day after that they're shippin' Mallory. That's when we do the Mickey Knox interview, 'cause the next day he goes.
I don't shed tears over the past, Monsieur Delben ; I look to the future.
Yeah, we'd better keep them for now, I'll try and get some glasses for tomorrow night.
I know, some are trapped, usually by money.
They never do.
Pretty much.
Frank works hard.
He leads, I follow.
Nobody's seen that.
We'll surely be in our graves if we don't.
Otherwise I'll call the police
So he thinks NASA is plotting to kill the President?
Isn't her album called "Number Four With A Smile?"
No! No puede hacer esto--
No es la verdad--
I know, kid. I know. Me too.
I wanna live with a musician. She'd write songs at home, ask me what she thought of them, maybe even include one of our private jokes in the liner notes.
I'm making it to you. If I don't get it by tonight--you'll find it a rough voyage.
Well, Annie, your place or mine?
Your place or mine?
Let me.
And it doesn't cramp your style?
Lint?
That grandmother of yours -- she's really something.
Devra, try Jackie Shawn will you? And if you don't reach her, keep trying.
He'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap.
Those mud puddles were certainly a waste of money.
And why. Is that?
Possible. But not darn likely.
Operating this winch you'd rarely operated before, doing this awkward job of bringing in a drowned man of 235 pounds...is it possible. Possible that he struck his head after death. Possible?
...so when the sheriff returned, you showed him the injury to the deceased's head.
I'm sorry. If there was any other-
Sir. Sir.
We're really in a terrible rush.
Sixty-five.
No thanks, Lee.
Your wife knows that, don't she?
Okay, thanks very much.
Why?
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne.
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet.
Well -- is that possible?
So, you propose that in spite of demonstrable infidelity on your part, your unoffending wife should be tossed out on her ear?
I know that sounds rough but I'm about to close on a deal to develop some mini-malls, and I'm mortgaged up to my ass. If this deal goes south, I'm ruined -- I'll lose millions.
That's the problem. I can't afford to give her anything.
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves. Well, let me ask you this: what kind of settlement do you seek? What are, for you, the parameters of the possible?
Mmm... And to cut to the chase, forensically speaking -- is there a pre-nup?
Video.
Bandit?
Let's hit it.
Just don't worry about it. How we doin' timewise?
-- But everytime we've ever messed up, it's because your rhyme's over- ruling your reason. I know you think you're God's gift to waitresses, but...
We're gone.
Not good enough to be standing here shooting the bull.
Why don't you be a good little boy and leave her alone?
Oh--I understand you were an important part of her education when she came to New York.
I just tried to show her the difference between the squirrels and the skunks.
You mean in signs?
She has spoken to me. I heard her voice. There was no sound, but I beard it here . Her voice was there in my head. I watched her lips, they did not make the words, yet the harder I listened the clearer I heard her, as clear as I hear you, as dear as I hear my own voice.
Spoken words?
No, not words.
It's all right, I forgive you. I'm not the vengeful type. We'll forget what happened. Why don't we take a trip together? Maybe kill a few lions in Kenya over Christmas.
Finally realized Rick's a jerk, huh?
You find this amusing, do you?
No.
No, I'm not.
No.
And place my reputation at stake?
Hey! Hey! Stop! Hey!
Nobody's gonna get you. Now get inside.
What?
Who?
You said somebody... who?
No shit?
What's up?
He took a shot. He's unconscious.
Because that's how people treat each other!
Bullshit. It was a misunderstanding. But instead of handling it politely, instead of treating her with respect --
I know. Where is he, I said.
Louie, take this lady over to Polack Mike's and lock her up. See that she doesn't take to anyone on the way.
Roger.
That's my girl.
Subic Bay, sir. In the Philippines.
I thought I recognized the work. Be proud of those wings. They're the only ones you're gonna leave here with, Mayo-naise.
Not exactly, sir.
Where'd you get this, Mayo? This is really wonder work.
I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
What makes you think he'll do it?
No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
He seems like he thrives on danger
Unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. So what's the point?
I teach her French, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.
You wanna go out with him?
What about him?
I'm afraid it may storm.
My heart intends no more than that you love me as I do you.
I have no wife.
Tis not fit for a princess.
If wishes were horses even beggars would ride.
Alcohol killed him--he drank himself to death.
Cirrhosis--it's a disease of the liver.
She's dead now, too. She was a nanny.
Barely. It hardly mattered that I knew him.
She looks after other people's children.
Don t get on that plane!
What if I couldn't get to you?
I was scared of what you were gonna do.
I'm listening.
Pretty good speech, Maggie.
You were not.
All right...
Route 395. Past Edwards Air Force base and about half a mile before a place called the Red Mountain Motel. There s a dirt track with a Closed to the public sign. It leads to some kind of ranch in the middle of nowhere. If you haven t heard from me by morning send the cavalry, okay? But not before, you hear?
I can tell you the when part. Tonight.
Please! Norville!
He's the best you have. He's going Top Gun!
Well -- I --
I was never stiffer in my life.
Darlin', this is X-File stuff! Think about it! The guy's got all this easily negotiable property. He's obviously setting something up very big. Like a self-sustaining island off the coast of South America, for instance. Or perhaps he's the head of a cult that's doing weird things with poultry and pipe tobacco. I've heard worse.
I do? Well, thank you! You like ceilings?
You have very nice ceilings.
Actually,no. I was wondering why Cliff likes to wear another man's underpants.
Eve! This guy is un-be-liev-able!
No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
Well, I hope you like these! Fresh sea urchin wrapped in seaweed. Or "nori" if you prefer. I love sushi.
Not particularly.
Me?
Thought you might need me--don't talk, kid, and don't let him scare you--
Are you a psychiatrist? He said it takes time.
Yes... Maybe... I don't know. I don't like competitions... It ruins the fun. Don't you think?
I don't know... why?
Maybe on earth there is one... but not when you dive... You see, to dive deep into the sea, for no reason... just to do it. It's a feeling... I don't know how to say this... Voluptuous?
Now don't go getting any ideas, Miss Kubelik.
Just somebody delivering a bottle of champagne. Like some?
Please, Miss Kubelik, you got to promise me you won't do anything foolish.
It's only one story down -- the best you can do is break a leg.
I would.
I'll send you a muff.
If we say that, Leon... we'll be sent to Siberia!
And if we have to go to Siberia...
Death is like spring training?
Kind of sore.
I can't keep up with you. First you say sex is gonna make me a better pitcher--now no sex is gonna do it?!
Who me? Nah, I'd just fuck them up. That was the one unpolluted part of my divorce -- no kids.
Is she sleeping or...?
Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
Yes, sir. They are indeed.
Oh, how are you, Baxter. They keeping you busy these days?
Good morning, Mr. Kirkeby.
Morning, Miss Kubelik.
What did you do to your hair?
I presume you'd prefer handling the delivery.
Yes, for both.
First pregnancy?
Marcee. How's my favorite player's wife?
There are three men -- he's one of them -- they think I have something that belongs to them.
What?
There was no trace of him. All right, Reggie -- suppose you tell me what this is all about.
Will you stop!... ... I'm in love with you...
... It's not just from tonight. I've known you for a long time. I see you come out of work every day. I walk with you to lunch. I know what you order... I see you buy Baby Ruths before going back in... I know how you feel on certain days by whether or not you go into the bookstore... ... I know you hate your job and you don't have many friends and you sometimes feel like you're not as... as wonderful as everybody else and you're a little uncoordinated ... and feeling like you're the only one who's as separate and... alone as you are... and I love you. I love you. I think you're the greatest thing since... spice racks and I would be knocked out several times if I even got just a first kiss. But I'll be back in the morning. And I won't be distant. And I will call if you let me... But I still don't drink coffee.
Think I'll take the juice?
Do you watch the news? Read the paper. Last week, this whole place was underwater.
I'm sorry. I'm just --
No, no, I came out here to get some shock therapy, but there was an energy crisis, so I... He's my-my food taster. Have you two met?
I see the big picture and you stumble around in the details.
Cool, huh?
Tell him his tea stinks.
Well... wait for it... First there's this one...
It's nerve wracking sometimes... women can get you very upset.
I know it, I know it.
What do you mean by 'dirty looks'?
When your son came back from the war, what did he say about all this?
George, I know you have to deal with Felicia and you're caught in the middle, and if you can just bear with me tonight, well, I appreciate the way you've handled the situation.
She asked about you, Madmartigan.
I must concetrate my imagination...to creat a new...reality!
I'll handle it. I'll handle it. Hi.
You're crazy. I think you're in love.
The supernatural! The powers of darkness! It's all true. Take your own life! Suicide, David. Join me.
And I think they just came back from Masters and Johnson.
Oh, man.
There's something about a nice hot bath, transforms a person. It's not just about opening up your pores, know what I mean? There's just something about the heat and the wet that's calming you know? Settles me in a way that I really can't articulate.
I know exactly what you mean. It's just a feeling. You know, I could go for some wine tonight.
Have the purser give you twenty-five hundred dollars for this check--and bring the cash here.
Hope I didn't keep you waiting.
Yeah. I just wanted to thank you for that message last night. It made me feel like... like less of an asshole.
Rob here.
What's happenin'.
What did you tell her about the shop for?
I didn't know it was classified information. I mean, I know we don't have any customers, but I thought that was a bad thing, not, like, a business strategy.
You re repeating yourself, Mrs De Moraes.
I bet Good Housekeeping would go gaga over the cole slaw piece.
Looking good out there.
I'll trade you my Porsche for Debbie. An even swap.
I'm very happy for you two.
Gee, guys, what should I do? The car or Debbie?
I mean it. The car is yours. Dump Debbie.
The car for Debbie?
So does Debbie.
What?
Yo.
I know what they can sleep through, Erin. I probably know it better than you.
She started touching herself and telling me how much she wanted me. She reached down and put me inside her. My doctor had warned me about exerting myself -- but you really don't think of those things at a moment like that. You just think about how beautiful this woman is -- how much you want her. How deeply you want to please her. At first it started off slowly -- but the rhythm built and built. Every time I got close to an orgasm she would stop. Eventually I started to have trouble breathing. Rebecca just kept going -- faster and faster. No matter what I said she wouldn't stop. I really thought for a moment I was going to die.
She told me that tonight we were going to open new doors. I asked her to stop -- to take off the handcuffs, but she wouldn't listen.
She's a woman who is very much aware of her own sexuality. Sometimes I felt she could read my mind. It was uncanny how she knew exactly what I wanted. A few nights before my heart surgery Rebecca woke me. She had handcuffed me to the bed.
It's hard to resist a woman as beautiful as she is.
She said she was going to fuck me like I've never been fucked before.
Bye, sweetie.
No. They're firing even more people than they said. Some will want to talk. It could help.
....she didn't, I didn't ask her out?
Nothing. I'm just at work and I'm wondering, you know your friend Lena?
There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
Did you like it that much?
It was better than this... Look, you, I'm very intelligent. If you're going to give me advice or conversation or consolation or hope, you got to be better than you're doing. If you can't be at least momentarily interesting than shut the hell up. I'm drowning and you're describing water.
Okay... you tell me why -- "You're dying here."
I don't know... Let me sleep on it and figure it out. Because I'm stuck! Can't go back to what I had... She's evicted me from my life.
But you know where you're lucky?
Absolutely not.
Picking on me won't help.
Well, if that's true then I'm really in trouble.
You know who you want. I'll take your seat any day. So do something... don't sleep on it... go over there. I don't think anybody should ever sleep on anything -- it's not always good to let things calm down.
I messed up, okay, I know that. But I ain't that kid's father.
Lucky kid.
Look, I ain't saying it was right, but sometimes things happen.
And some things should never fucking happen!
Your door was unlocked.
Still is, so let yourself out.
We need to talk.
We ain't got nothing to talk about.
I ain't a damn liar.
Oh, my lord, you will not shake me off, she never needed me more, I sear by your breeches!
My magazine doesn't pay because for stories. It's not what you call ethical.
You've seen the post-its. I've already got more juicy material than I need. Why should I pay you dollar one?
I'm not a boastful man. What's your point?
Really.
Too much.
Good work, my brothers. Fan-fuckin'- tastic! I think that interview stuff's too long, we can lose some of that. Keep the girls, keep the long hairs, keep the Hun brothers, keep the black guy, keep the movie shit, and keep the cop at the donut shop. Lose the rest. And cut the interview with the prison board fellow before that. Cut it after I ask, 'I take it by your answer it was a whole new team.' Don't even let him answer. Fuck him. Then cut to me talking about the two chicken shit psychiatrists and straight in Dr. Reinghold laughing.
Not if you make it worth my while. How about free boonies for the duration?
Hey, you gonna tell anybody about this?
I'm warning you. You don't stall that bad attitude, no one's gonna recruit you.
With a jacked-up attitude.
I don't.
It's grown out more than an inch, sweetheart.
You told us it would grow out an inch.
Hmmm.
Now the sheriff believed that the D-6 battery in Carl's well was Carl's own spare. Even though it was too large f...
Shi... Sorry, honey. I was having the weirdest dream.
Weird. The book again. Sex spelled backwards...
Uh...sure...I...what?
You go to
Take your hands off me. What you call me?
Give me that gun.
Why don't you go and chase yourself?
What did you say?
A bum. Look what you're doing. You want to be brave? Firing lead into another man's flesh isn't brave. Any bum who picks up a .45 in a pawn shop can be that brave. You want to hurt Johnny Friendly? You want to fix him for what he did to Charley and a dozen men who were better than Charley? Don't fight him like a hoodlum down here in the jungle. That's just what he wants. He'll hit you in the head and plead self-defense. Fight him tomorrow in the courtroom with the truth as you know it Truth is the gun Drop that thing and tell the truth a more dangerous weapon than this little cap pistol.
What do you mean?
My keys.
Yeah...
I just wanted to keep an eye on you. The guy's a total stranger, remember?
It started as a favor for my brother you know they'd ask me things and it's hard to say no a favor Who am I kiddin'? They call it a favor but it's do it or else. And this time the favor turned out to be helping them knock off Joey. I just thought they'd lean on him a little but Last night with Edie I wanted to tell her only it stuck in my throat. I guess I was scared of drivin' her away and I love her, Father. She's the first thing I ever loved.
Why not you -- Jean d'Aulon? The only man who's poorer than I am, and so the only man I can trust. Dignified, honorable, wise... what more could we ask of a king?
What do you mean?
I'll bet.
I don't know, but you seem sort of distant.
Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware.
I don't know what good that'll do. Chickens won't eat.
I'm simply quoting the law.
All right, let it go.
Hey, hey, aren't you afraid you'll burn out a tonsil?
No, thanks. We're not hungry.
But what do I do?
"Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet near day It was the nightingale and not the lark That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear. Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree. Believe me, love, it was the nightingale."
Good. Until then, feel free to live like a king!
The next time I walk into a bank.
Just let me know when you are going out and where --
John. Old friends. Acquaintances call me Scottie.
My name is John Ferguson.
Wander about.
No, I wouldn't like that. And after what happened today I should think you could call me Scottie. Or even John.
Some people prefer it.
Look, sweetheart, he scares you. But I'm not scared of that motherfucker. He can't touch you now. You're completely out of his reach. He poses absolutely no threat to us. So, if he doesn't matter, which he doesn't, it would be stupid to lose your things, now wouldn't it?
Yes, Comrade.
Is there anything I can do, Comrade?
Yes, Comrade.
I'm sorry, Kitty - what were you saying?
Come on, pal! It was a compliment! You'da done the same if you had the equipment!
FORGET IT! NO WAY! I'M NOT GETTING -
THAT DOES IT! BACK IN THE PACK!
What union?
I'm reportin' this to my union!!
The sidekicks' union! Me, Tonto, and Robin the Boy Wonder. You top bananas better watch your ass!
Uh... Yes, of course!
But you haven't lived here long.
You'll be safe. You don't have to worry.
I was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.
Will you leave me alone?
Yeah, I-I think you're pretty lucky I came along.
La-de-da. If I-if anyone had ever told me that I would be taking out a girl who used expressions like "la- de-da"...
Well, no... not just, not only.
You fucking bastard...
How quickly?
Where's Snow? Did you call him?
You'll get results one way or the other, that's for sure... Okay.
I'm gonna be here if you need anything.
You sure you want this, because... that's putting an awful lot of faith in people we have no control over...
I'm afraid the situation demands that kind of risk.
It's messy... the thing's got a gun... We're just asking for somebody to get killed...
We don't know what else to do. We need results.
I don't like it, George...
Dammit Shermin. Earlier you were asking for help. What's changed?
Yeah yeah hurry up. Zuzu's sick.
I know that girl!
Aw, now, doggone it, Ernie, don't you start pulling that stuff. You know where I live. Three-twenty Sycamore. Now hurry up.
Okay. Just step on it. Just get me home.
See she doesn't drink too much.
Is that the Queen's request?
Do you know that house?
I just wanted to test it first.
Then why don't you want to teach it to me too? Now that there's no more cranking, and it's easier?
It's time to go home, Holly.
So tell me, Wyatt. I'm curious. Do you actually consider youself A married man? Forsaking all Others?
One beer, one coffee, thanks.
I think we should be going honey.
Well, for a start, you've got to get cleaned up.
Awful lot of money.
It s hard to explain.
No, no, I love, it's just, thinking you're, you must be so sick of it... Well.
-- FUCK OFF!
Rob --!
That's fucking great, Barry. We can spend fifteen bucks on a cab to save five each. Fantastic, Barry!
We're only on the fucking list for Marie's gig at the Pulaski Pub, that's all! All three of us.
It's not my car, now is it? It's Laura's car, and thus Laura has it. So it's an ass-bumping double- transferring bus ride through bumblefuck or a fat wad on a cab. Wow. Fucking great.
We can take your car.
I just thought maybe you and me could--
Bastards. That's why I always eat at Lawreys.
No thanks, my stomach's a little upset. I ate somethin' at a restaurant that made me a little sick.
No. But thanks.
A Norms in Van Nuys.
Where'd you go?
I'm Bruce Baldwin!
I've just told you I was busy with Mr. Bruce Baldwin!
Yes!
You're Bruce Baldwin?
Then who are you?
This is a pleasure, Mr. Baldwin, and I'm sorry about the mistake.
Oh, I thought there was something funny... You see, Bruce, you don't mind if I call you Bruce, do you? After all, we're practically related --

Topol.
All right.
Naw. Any good?
Then don't hassle it.
What would?
I broke my ankle skating. That ended that dream.
Yeah.
Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
I say, my friend, do you know a fellow by the name of Longfellow Deeds?
Yes.
Yes, I
We'd like to get in touch with him. It's very important.
What did you say?
Excuse me?
It s lovely...
Will you marry me, Loretta Castorini Clark?
Will you marry me.
Loretta?
What?
Yes but I was a boy. And I still had hell to pay.
Why?
You can't end up with Tom because it goes totally against everything you're about.
This is an official visit, then--
But why me? Why'd you pick on me??
It's simple, Stu. We need nightmares - lots of 'em. So whenever we can swing it, we send a guy up to stimulate the flow...a nightmare maker! Like Steve here. Poe. Rasputin...we've been doing this all the way back to Atilla and Genghis Khan!
Four hundred -- But that was a long time ago.
YOU SET ME UP!!
Easy, pal! I was coming to congratulate you. It ain't easy snatching one of those E-tickets. Steve here was the last guy to pull it off, and that musta been, what, 25 years ago...?
It's so bright.
Ahhh!
No. I've got you.
Don't you throw up on boat?
I've been thinking a lot the last couple days. About us, actually.
Why not?
Ahm... Bernie.
When you're hitting you shouldn't think about anything but hitting. But you shouldn't think about it too much. The trick is to use your brain to not use your brain.
I'm a professional killer.
We'd love to hear it.
Is he the one who spread all this blood and misery?
So your memory's coming back?
Oh no? How about this one?
It didn't go anywhere. But that's not why --
Right.
Love doesn't have to be right. It just has to be love.
Sh-sh-sh ! Soft pedal, you mug! before I What're you trying to do? Tell the whole world about it! Now listen, you're in this thing and you're staying in! Get me? You know too much.
But I'm a married man. I got a couple of kids. I can't get mixed up with
Yeah the "big boy" the Boss of the outfit.
That's all right. I got a couple of machine guns in my suitcase. I'll let you have one of them.
What's the matter with you! Gettin' yellow?
Say, look! I didn't know it was anything like this, see and
You're not kidnapping her, are you?
It clearly is why.
You better not be fuckin' teasin' me.
You will?
Alone again. What are you up to today?
I only got about three bucks on me now, but I just live about eight blocks from here on the other side of Webster Avenue. Why don't we walk back to my house? I'll run in, pick up some dough, and let's step out somewhere.
It's only a quarter of twelve. The clock's right over there.
Wadda you think?
I asked you...
My family found this baby in the river, High Aldwin.
Whoa...
I don't think I've slept in a year.
I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
yeah?
No.
No.
Everybody's got some, I guess.
No.
A coffee and a couple of croissants.
Yeah. Goodnight, Mrs De Moraes.
Not yet. The place I hoped to find him turns out to be little more than a contact address. I ll give it 24 hours. He just might show up. If you need to reach me ask for Mr Lamont. Paul Lamont, all right?
Are you all right?
Why you're just a girl. What do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?
Croissants.
Do you know where you are, Fran?
Good. You're discreet. I like that in a partner.
Listen, I'm the cop that polices the police. I'm not in the business of protecting crooked cops. I'll make an arrest when I know everybody involved.
Why?
Please.
Yeah, look at that thing.
What happened to your toe?
How do you say "hospital" in Japanese?
You're taking advantage of a minor.
I know. I borrowed it from your grandparents because I... I... it doesn't matter. Don't worry, they're fine... Look, I used to feel that same way, said practically those same words, sitting at night in a foxhole in Korea... I've chased you across the country, Betty, and I come to find out we're a lot more alike than you'd think.
No one is, honey. Here, listen to this... "If who I am and who I hope to be should meet one day, I know they will be friends." Now that's beautiful.
Well, thirty-three, but I'm not counting Del, on account of you... so, what do you think? You probably feel I'm flattering myself to see us together.
Wait. Let me get this out. I like the symphony, walks in the rain, sunsets, animals and children. I read passionately, and I like to discuss things. I'm basically conservative, but flexible. I've been involved in the death of thirty- two people, but I can live with that because the world is lighter by thirty- two pieces of shit, excuse my language.
Yes, but I'd sort of like to put that behind me now...
I'd like to talk with Jane McKenna.
Won't you join us for a drink?
Oh, no, Rick never --
And clean.
Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
Well then, perhaps you also ---
How do you do?
How do you do?
Feeling better?
Preysing, you're joking with us.
If you actually have news from Manchester then...
Gentlemen, I am now free to announce... ...that the deal between my firm and the Manchester Cotton Company has been successfully negotiated.
What?
Oh no -- no -- the session is over. Let's go, it's off. Thank you, gentlemen.
Goodbye, Preysing, I hope you pull through. This is a very bad time to be in such a crisis. We've...
Why talk -- it's over -- it's over -- it's finished. You've broken off negotiations. You did it. You're calling them off. You had nothing on your mind all day, but Manchester, -- Manchester -- Manchester. You don't suppose for one moment that I'm such a fool as not to have something that I could say definitely about Manchester.
Hi. Annie had no plans, huh? I'm glad you came. Are you hungry?
Can you fix it?
In that case give us the articles. We'll sign at once. We know all the details...
Maybe the thought of people like you going on holiday bothers me. Come on, let s go...
This is another victory, my friends. What began with the lash shall be concluded with a caress.
I have something far more pleasant awaiting me.
Indeed, the best of fun... Enjoy yourselves.
You re out of your mind. What s the idea?
I'm Lloyd Dobler.
No.
Shut up and drive!
Temperature's dropping.
I make it twentysix twenty-three. You're fifty short, Skins.
Money talks, bullshit walks, whether you like it or not.
Thank you, Jonah. But the point is, I am not asking permission.
I don't have a ring!
No ma'am. I have been asleep all my life up to this moment. Marylin, will you marry me?
No.
You do?
Yes? Yes, you do have more experience?
You think a woman did that?!
I'm tellin' you it wasn't no woman, Roy!
Jesus...
It wasn't a woman.
Yes it was. Betty saw the whole thing! Your killer's name is Chloe...
You need to get yourself gone from my crime scene. And leave Betty alone, she's...
She knows who killed Del. Elden, she said it was a woman.
Come on! It's not that hard. All you need is one person. Once the right person thinks you're cool, you're in. Everyone else will be too scared to question it.
I have to have a life. I have to do things that I want with people my own age. It's none of your business who I am going out with. I don't give a good goddam if you're angry --
So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
Only feeding the disease, eh, Martin?
Are you going with her?
It might be in the kitchen.
Son, we'll do business, I can tell you that.
Jesus, what'd you crawl through, a sewer?
Take your sunglasses off.
But his mother --
Okay.
Look, sergeant I know I said some things last time that I shouldn't have said at all but...
Don't talk.
Uh, well ...
Now?
Okay, so what's a girl supposed to do? Me not workin' and her cleanin' house for a white man. I'm tellin' you, boy, keep away from marriage. Ya gotta stay light on your feet or you won't make it.
Well, matter of fact, I done a lot of bangin' 'round.
Accommodate? I don't think I know what you mean.
Why don't we let Mr. Daniels tell us what he's trying to say.
Sometimes.
Hold on. You have no idea why I'm angry?
A vulgar pop term, but yes. Take an ordinary man and turn him into an assassin. That was our goal.
M.K. ULTRA was terminated in 1973. But not the research. It was renamed. EX CATCHER.
As in 'resulting in death.' We pushed the envelope until it wasn't even an envelope anymore.
What kind of daughterly smackeroo was that?
Seventy-five dollars, and a ride. Okay.
Yeah. It's all over.
Ellie...
I'm all right.
Alexander Pope?
Oh. Well, I'd love to hear some.
How do you mean?
It's a good quote, Mary. I'm glad we both know it.
Is that Nietzsche?
You're a bad, bad girl, Stephanie.
So you must remember Sheriff Wade.
A bad girl, Miles. She might need to be spanked.
Do you know how often these pourers get hit on?
Get the trunk.
We're on.
We don't have the time to bring someone new up to speed. Besides... You've already impressed everyone you need to, haven't you?
Rockville Center.
Yeah.
I'm not going to be drawn into this.
Well -- I'm sure you think you do, Ben, but after a few times in bed with Elaine I feel quite sure you'd get over that as quickly as you --
The point is -- I don't love your wife. I love your daughter, sir.
Nothing's happening!
My parents are dead. Don't even think of bringing them into this.
Well, you got the first down--there's one more to go. Come on, we're ready to start right now. Come on. Just keep stiff.
A blueprint spool.
I didn't think you'd know I went missing.
I'm not talking just physically. Even your anger is perfect.
Four days. I left to think.
I wasn't thinking. Look, I'm sorry I didn't think to call you while I thought...I think.
He's dead.
How are you doing, Warren?
Oh yeah, healed right up. No visible scars.
Really? I never got a message.
I'm gonna take a rain check.
Did Leon tell you why he didn t want the police involved, Rhian?
Of course not. Alexei, he's is my problem.
So hang on. You're both Nadia's cousins?
Toast first then we talk seriously, I can see you are serious about us.
Hold on.
And what? You mean from the beginning? Jesus. Can I uh okay, as we say in Russia can I cut a long story short. Okay. Nadia is my little cousin. Except she's not. But we say cousin. This is for you.
And...
Good.
We better watch him. He's crazy.
Right.
Hello.
He's not.
Ah, but how will you capture us? We know the secrets of the Fire Swamp. We can live there quite happily for some time. So, whenever you feel like dying, feel free to visit.
This was the Reverend Porter's wife, you have her looking like a two dollar hooker.
think that's, uh-
Yeah, I meet a lotta jerks, too.
Yes sir..
Oh, you... you're very popular, I can see.
You're gonna sing? Do you sing? Well, no, it isn't No kidding? this is my first time. Oh, really? Where? I'd like to come. Oh, no, no, no, no, no! No, I'm interested!
Working....Under cover.
That wasn't an image. She WAS an old school Marm. Fix it.
Never mind my nose. What kind of a chump do you think I am? You think I'm going to live here in your house - on your dough? What do you think my friends would all say? Don't be silly. I'd get the razzing of my life for that. 'A bird in a gilded cage' - that's what I'd be. Not me. Oh no, not me!
Do you know Leon s parents names?
I made you do too many things, kept you up all night --
I called to tell you I was sending one over but the line was busy, you're always on the phone.
It was a mercy-killing after all.
Where?
Have they found our friend?
Great.
.. Nothing.
Choices???
Damn, that's sweet... She really that good-looking in person?
Okay?
Wesley...
Bert, if that's his best game, I can beat him.
Just an idea I had.
Five point two.
What the hell happened to you?
...one night I was asleep, and a noise wakes me up. I thought, 'Oh shit, somebody's broken in.' I didn't own a gun, so I go into the living room with a fucking umbrella. Okay, it turned out to be nothing. God made the noise. Who knows?
I want to know who you are.
Now I'm going to tell you the truth. I really came in here because I was bored stiff by the party.
Like what?
Cheaper I guess, take us both down in one van.
You're Holly.
Cool....Either of you know the way to Krakow?
Hi.
Boy, you really musta made out good last night.
Whatta you wanna do?
You know they gonna set us up.
Anything stronger? Oh, probably not. Beer? You can drink beer, can't you?
That's about all I ever eat.
I can, but I don't.
Rafe's girl, Evelyn?
I'll explain. And I'll use small words so that you'll be sure to understand, you wart-hog-faced buffoon.
Well, thank you, I expect she will appreciate it.
No, now I can't kill you.
You can't kill me. I died years ago.
I looked up to you, Uncle. My brother always said I was a fool. Never trust the British, he said: the deal-makers, the map-makers; never shake hands with them.
Kip?
What have I been doing all this time? Do you know how many mines I've seen? - more mines than there are soldiers, more - how many mines we've put in the ground ourselves, stuffed in corpses, dropped out of the sky. And now this.
What are you talking about?
No goodbyes, Elaine. Just go.
His name's David Stockman. He's been here twenty years, that's all he says.
That's the way I want it. Just turn the radio on and go.
Now!
Or a vegetarian?
We've blown the computer! Elaine! Set course change!
I know. I wish I felt the same. Unfortunately, I feel nothing. I think it was just the conquest. Sorry, I'm completely fucked up.
Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout. That's New York living.
Oh, please!
I don't know?
Yes. I would like my flask back.
No, I'm just calling you... a guy who has my flask.
Hey...
No.
You'd better before you catch the disease!
We wear so many goddam masks after a while they get stuck to our faces, you know? And they don't come off. But when you find the one person who really knows you, and then you lose her...
Great.
Aye, now and again, but what of it? I have lost my gift.
...Tell them that's not my problem. I was paid for one job-- the cyclist-- not two. See you tomorrow, Marcella.
Patch him through....
What do you want?
I'm setting up a concern that would enable those of us in our rarefied profession to consolidate our efforts.
Come on, Jack. It's not like it's the first time we've bunked together. It'll be like when we were kids. Relax. Enjoy the view.
I feel like a dick. You must think I'm a dick.
All of them.
Fax these to this number, okay?
No! Yes! I'll be right out, Dad. Oh shit! Peggy, I'm going to snap you out of it.
Me? You went crazy! You started taking your clothes off. I was putting them back on for you.
Is it ever embarrassing, having your bum kissed in public?
Nice.
They're trying to make me spend the summer here. I'm leaving in the morning.
I'm supposed to be in Tahoe.
I don't know.
Hey you not up yet? Come on come on!
No... You go in there, I'll have to kill you.
Yeah, he said for you to give us a lift into town. You're the ones with the Studebaker, aren't you?
Can't afford to take chances.
Nah, skip that... I'm going to have to keep an eye on you, though.
Eight o'clock.
No.
Now by killer, you mean...?
How'd you manage that one?
Where?
Where are you now?
When?
Where were you born?
Have you been here before?
Where?
Easy Morg, don't think about that now.
Do you expect me to believe that your lover brought you here tonight?
And he doesn't care about me?
If his love were like mine, he would not permit you to come here.
Will he wish to know the details of this night?
Tender Hegenheim.
Loved?
There -- you're a new man.
I'm no easier to live with than he was.
Not possible.
Okay, I'll drive you around there some day. Ouch!
But, Skipper, Cougar's been picked for Top Gun...He's the best of the best!
Alexander.
Alex -- how can you tell if someone is lying or not?
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth, but I had to find out your part in all this.
Yes sir!
Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass.
If you hit me, I'll call the police.
You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now.
You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition.
No.
Good.
Now, Mister Gi...
I'm sorry about that. It wasn't mine in the first place.
So the fishing gaff method wouldn't make sense?
Now if you wanted to kill a man. Think you'd try boarding against his will, and hitting him with a fishing gaff?
Had I known your taste in novels, I never would've taught you to read.
Okay.
It doesn't have to, it's something that happens. It's like seeing a person you never saw before -- you could be passing on the street -- you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. Like you both know something. But then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "What if I had stopped and said something?" It might happen only a few times in your life.
Pick up the license. You have to ask nicely 'cause I've had an extremely rough day. You know, my girl friend-
Officer, I know what you're gonna say. I'm-I'm not a great driver, you know, I-I have some problems with- with-with-
Sure. just don't-don't get angry, you know what I mean? 'Cause I-I have - I have my-my license here. You know, it's a rented car. And I've...
You mean they give awards for that kind o' music?
I thought just earplugs.
Now I want you to do something for me.
Well, the point is Mr. Gazzara wantsa sell his shop now, because he and his wife are lonely, and they wanna move out to California in Los Angeles and live near their married daughter. Because she's always writing them to come out there. So it's a nice little shop. I handle his books for him, so I know he has a thirty-five percent markup which is not unreasonable, and he takes home net maybe a hundred, hundred and fifty bucks a week. The point is, of course, you gotta worry about the supermarkets. There's two inna neighborhood now, and there's an A P coming in, at least that's the rumor. Of course, mosta his trade is strictly Italian, but the younger Italian girls, they get married, and they don't stick to the old Italian dishes so much. I mean, you gotta take that into account too.
Nice of you... thank you.
But not nice enough to marry--eh?
I felt pretty low, Sally, when I heard you were running around with a racketeer--
News travels fast on Broadway--you had to get away from a rat--
Lovely.
My dear Aulon, to you it shall befall the honor of impersonating the royal blood!
Majesty, I can't...
Why, are you not ready to die for your king?
Of course I am, it's just that...
Ours.
Hey, what is this-an interview? We're supposed to be making love.
so if I get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. You know-'cause they're always laughin'.
Yeah, she won a fellowship.
Then whose is it? His or theirs?
That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
So?
In what man!
A deal?
What John Doe?
You've had it. I'm gonna get you.
Don't you love it when old friends stop by?
Go.
Six. Got it.
If I say go to two, it's really one.
Twenty-one is nineteen.
Is that why you killed Lee Lother?
Ok.
I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
They sure do.
Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
Why are you being so hateful to me? Is this because of Lloyd?
What?! No please, sir --
Shhhhhh!
It.
I wish.
I, uh... I got it stuck.
Yeah. All twenty minutes so far have been a blast.
I said forget it, answer's no, I Don't want the job and that's Final. I'm going to Tombstone and Nothin' short of dyin's gonn Stop me. Good day.
And Mademoiselle?
May we proceed with the business?
Gripping. It's not Jane Austen, it's not Henry James, but it's gripping.
You like Chagall?
Where'd you get it?
Here they come! The champion flock of the neighborhood.
Well, I'm going to tell you anyway. I did cheat on that exam at Groton. But so did twenty-six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. And I'm expecting you won't mention it again. I don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but I'm willing to pretend I did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. But can I tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him. What are you, his shadow? Do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak? You know some- times somebody would like a few min- utes alone with W.P. That means without you. Okay, pal? Let's eat.
Well, I do Barbara Rush.
Her hair, I do Barbara Rush.
I guess not...
Yeah, I think you're probably right... because when you try to...
I don't know.
Will you please stop smoking?
I'm really beat. I need some serious "z's"--
We are here to discuss our merger. Naturally I can make no statement at this time. We must begin at the beginning.
You'll live.
Since, on the eleventh of June, this year -- when the first negotiations for a merger between our respective firms was entered into -- both parties have fully agreed that this merger can result only in mutual advantages.
Oh -- yes -- I beg your pardon!
I'm laying before you the last general statement of our concern. Active capital, plant and machinery, raw material and finished product -- for instance -- mop rags --
Mop rags --!
What we want to know about is Manchester.
How's that?
I'd like to wait for Justice Zinnowitz, before I commit myself.
Oh -- Preysing, Preysing --
Well, then, I know it takes three -- four weeks for you to come round to admit when you're wrong... But by that time she's liable to be in China...
I guess so -- but don't make a habit of it.
I can explain that, Hartman. When Hildy told me she wanted to interview Earl Williams I thought it might be dangerous and I gave her a gun to defend herself.
Oh, you did! Well, that's very, very interesting. This happens to be the gun that Earl Williams shot his way out with!
You're barking up the wrong tree, Hartman.
I'll give you three minutes to tell me where he is.
By name only.
Well, what's the matter?
He... Apparently the hostility was all hers. Leon didn t... It hurt him. They used to be close... Their parents were in their forties when they were born, you see. And mostly away. They grew up in a Scottish mansion with old nannies and servants. He... Our world was so old and cold, we shone for one another, Leon used to say. His sister cut him off after she got married. He never understood why but thought it was because she had no children. Was bitter...
The money Leon left for the boy, was it cash?
How was it?
Why?
These for me?
Greetings, my lady, the green wood is honored.
Oh.
He just needs some clothes?
Well, they aren't.
Got any last minute advice?
Your job is... the ring. Do you have the ring?!
I have no idea what I'm doing.
I just found out I'm best man! I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong?
Nothing. I'm just wondering if they have a bar or not. I mean let's go see. Let's go see if they do or not.
... How long was I asleep?
Arthur! Who's Arthur?
He's the shipping clerk at the Tallow Works. Wants a 2 raise - or he'll quit.
But how'll I put on the slipper, sir?
Yes, sir. I beg pardon, sir, but did you ever find what you were looking for, sir?
Looking for?
You kept searching me last night, sir. Going through my pockets. You said you were looking for a rhyme for Budington.
Better bring me some coffee, Walter.
Very good, sir. Oh, I beg pardon. A telegram came for you, sir. I'll get you some black coffee, sir.
Did you see all this stuff in the papers?
Arthur wants to quit!
The wandering sportswriter.
Where are you going? Just-- out of curiosity...
Nice dress.
Hey--
And a share. We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!
Can do no right by people. Come to take, you wan' to stay, leave you stay, you wan' to go. Rahtid!
Oh, we gonna be friends now?
What's the title?
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter.
Home sweet home!
I've been using since I was twelve! You're all so unbelievably stupid. You didn't give a shit about anything I did until now!
I'll apologize for everything but today...Today I give a shit.
You're too fucking late.
You can't make me do a thing.
Sit down for a second.
No.
One more night and you're finally rid of me.
Eleven and a half.
I don't know, he had a meeting or something.
I'd quit the Army for you, if it came to that.
Sheriff--hi--this is Sergeant--this is Priscilla Worth.
I do. I want to very badly.
I'm delighted.
Play it again. Learn something. Fats went in the john, see? Washed his face, cleaned his fingernails, made his mind a blank, combed his hair, came back all ready to go. You were through. You saw him, you saw how he looked. Clean, all set to start all over again. Hold tight and push hard. You know what you were doing? You were waitin' to get beat. Flattened out on your butt, swimmin' around in glory. And whisky. Probably deciding how you could lose.
I know. Been there myself. We've all been there, haven't we, Miss Packard?
Fine.
Hey, whaddya say something like that for?
Never touch the stuff. I've got friends all over the world. Good friends I can see when I want, if I want.
No.
I could've pulled the car up on the tracks, slowed it down some.
No I'm sorry, now I have to get off the phone....
Everybody loves trout.
Well, I'll catch you a big trout. Soon as we get to the mountains.
I have to go.
Knots!
Oh,--we're doing about thirty--
No. Knots!
I think it has something to do with your birthday. You were rambling. I didn't understand the rest.
No--He's probably one of the "Here's How." Take it easy--the ocean's pretty rough today--
I'll take two. One for later.
You ever been strangled by a single hand?
Just be glad you're all right.
So am I, But it has to be done. I have to tell you about Madeleine, now.
Should we counsel fear -- or trust? Should we seek to destroy -- or to build? Should we meet our clients' problems with cynicism -- or with love?
Extinguish?
Please look at me. You must believe me -- you must believe that I love you -- that I have never known what love is -- until last night.
Oh, forgive me. Is this yours?
Fuck you. Just cause I don't spend all day trying to prove what hot shit I am --
I don't know how to explain it. I'm just too miserable.
I admit I moved to Paris because I was tired of American Provincial,
Because I don't love him.
--and as soon as we lose a game, he'll be back in your arms.
Who are you? Do you have a job?
And now you wanta teach me?
I doubt that.
I thought you wanted an "uncomplicated" boy?
With this chick.
What?
Um... not exactly. But I've been honest. I haven't told her I'm available. And she knows this trip up here is only for a few days. Besides...
Does she know about Saturday?
Well... I don't know, just... the wedding.
Besides what?
What?
Don't say that, Vizzini. Please.
-- I do not accept excuses. I'm just going to have to find myself a new giant, that's all.
Well, I'm carrying three people. And he's got only himself.
You were supposed to be this colossus. You were this great, legendary thing. And yet he gains.
What word would you use, Elaine?
I'm... just looking for Parry...
No. You got the wrong idea.
True -- every event has an infinite number of causes -- but why pick one rather than another? There are many ways a sword might find itself in a field...
All right, Virge, your call. But Give Doc the shotgun. They'll be Less apt to get nervy if they see Him on the street howitzer.
No, damn it, it's wrong, they're Breakin' the law.
You'll never make that stick.
Virge, that's a misdemeanor. You Go down there to arrest 'em, Something goes wrong, maybe this Time somebody gets his head Broke, suddenly it's a mess and It won't end there, you'll have Cowboys comin' around lookin' for Trouble from here to Christmas. You gonna risk all that over a Misdemeanor?
They're carrying guns in town.
Aw come on, Miss Price!
How is that?
Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
I'm not very hungry, thank you.
Please, really. I'm not hungry.
Do you understand me?
God's teeth, am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?! What will you do in Act Two when he meets the love of his life?
He is speaking about a baggage we never even meet! What will be left in your purse when he meets his Juliet?
Of course you have not! I have not written it!
I hope you won't let this news spoil your dinner. Nice food, isn't it?
What, do you think I planned it?
Was it me, did you have something against me?
No, not yet, not yet. You worry about it for a while, I've been worrying all night, now you can worry.
That's got nothing to do with it... You're so beyond my comprehension I can't even discuss it with you.
I'm not anti-Establishment.
I wanna know your thinking, I wanna know how someone like you thinks. Did you think you could get away with it, did you think you could put something over on me? Does a guy like you get his kicks sneaking around behind people's backs and taking advantage of them? Maybe that's your idea of being anti Establishment!
What can I say!
It is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship.
Didn't they tell you?
Did they have something against me?
Well, waddaya say, you wanna ask them? I'll take the one inna green dress.
Yeah, she looks all right from here.
Down there. That little one there.
Where?
I think this number is a little fast. Wait a minute.
Then you do think I'm insane.
What, leaving school...
I see, you've got your hands too far up your collective arse to pull it out long enough except to drink my bloody wine.
Everyone ok?
Your flunkey said he was expected back tonight.
Get to the point, will you...
What do you suggest?
That's all, Ned. Thank you.
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will you? Go on out and get married and have a lot o' babies but stay out o' newspaper business!
Take care.
Now, don't get into any trouble.
And to prove to the voters that the Red Menace is on the level, the Sheriff has written himself four more letters, threatening his life. I know he wrote 'em on account of the misspellings.
Trouble is, when the Red Menace shows up the Sheriff will still be crying 'Wolf!'
This Egelhoffer's pretty good.
Yeah? What did he ever do for his country?
Don't you remember? He's the guy went to Washington to interview the Brain Trust, and gave out a statement that they were all sane. It created a sensation!
This is Murphy. More slop on the hanging.
Ready? The Sheriff's just put two hundred more relatives on the payroll to protect the city against the Red Army -- which is leaving Moscow in a couple of minutes. Up a dime.
Really?
Not me. I'm in my prime.
Try me.
When?
Well, this is going to sound a little crazy.
Hey.
Have a good trip.
I don't freak out.
You know, Eve -- don't get mad, okay? - - but, I'd just be lost without you.
And, um ...I guess... I guess you and I, uh...
Okay.
There's something else I would like you to help me with.
Oh? What happened to Hochstetler?
Well, I hope you've changed.
Lose 'em.
You look wonderful. You do. What happened to you?
Um-hum.
But I was baptized. And I certainly wasn't born of incest.
I always knew you was pretty.
On the nose. I tell you what, because you re so cute, I ll take care of our incidentals.
How's it supposed to work Rebecca? You and Paley celebrate your victory. You get me over here and provoke a fight so he has to rush in and save you -- but then he's given himself away as your accomplice -- now he has to kill me. After that I figure she'll tell the Police that you broke in. That you were crazed because we humiliated you in court?
Why are you crying?
The Palace of the Legion of honor. The Art Gallery.
It could be freezing, it could be raining.
Oh, and there's another thing about New York. See... you-you wanna see a movie, you have to stand in a long line.
Claire...
Yeah, yeah, I was awake anyway so I figured They got it made. Eat all they want fly around like crazy sleep side by side and raise gobs of squabs.
I found them in your file box.
Why should he forget it?
The Falkner sisters are rather timid, Your Honor, and wish to be together. If the court pleases, I will only have one of them testify.
It's Richard Ripley.
You see, it s like I say. You always have an answer for everything.
You guys-- come on-- this is too heavy!
I'll take the shades off. Just get this fuckin' thing off me.
I guess the bright glare out here made it hard to see the numbers on the weights.
There can't be any wrong in this, Ha...
Well, I don't do it for just anybody.
I've got eleven horses to get over the mountains before snow catches me and covers the feed.
What?
Okay.
I wouldn't worry about it--it'll turn up-- How about a nightcap, Inspector?
I hope it works.
We have that all figured out. You see, Harry'll take my job at the Building and Loan, work there four years, then he'll go.
...06...14...18...48...right there. Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... Merry Christmas and shit...
You're still convinced there's a link to the department?
In my village, we have a saying: when the wind blows, the flags of all nations flap in the same direction.
Dollars.
That's what I had in mind.
Just like that?
It's classified. Like Hollywood says, I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.
No, I beg yours. But I don't think you're right on that.
I saw one.
I saw a MiG do a 4 G negative dive.
It's classified.
Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's clothes . Ain't that right, Homer?
The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up there ! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
You think? Maybe I was. I love this place!
It was my favorite night at the orphanage--movie night. We'd race into the dining hall. Of course everyone wanted to sit in front, so we'd be packed in so tight you could feel the kid next to you breathing.
Nice way to help a colleague in trouble.
Why did you kill Friedman?
The one down your trousers.
No doubt about it.
You better win a hand -- you're on a blitz.
Mr. Sheldrake? Oh, yes. Very.
Nothing. Just clear out, will you?
There be no finer victuals than worm flesh, lad.
Better we eat him than the other way round.
I've got to see you.
But not now.
WE NEVER SUSPECTED YOU!
Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense--
So? Someone'll send it on ahead.
She going to be all right, Doc?
Hi.
Hi.
Couple of wrong turns. Thanks to Magellan, here.
Why do you get to choose? Why don't I get to choose?
I saw you on T.V... at his funeral.
Everything does. One of the laws of nature. People are always so afraid of change. But if you look at it like it's something you can count on happening, it's actually a comfort. Not many things you can count on for sure.
I never thought I'd...
I'll be in touch.
And you think she bought it?
Pretty sure or sure sure?
I'm pretty sure she did.
You would not believe what--
I'm sure we will.
Yeah, you gotta go 'YEAH', strength. Poor little man.
Thank you, Ned.
Oh
Ned I know I know
What did he say to you in French?
It's okay. It's not that hot anymore. Thanks God.
Have you ever been to that station?
You know that little place nearby with the striped awning that sells sandwiches and little pizzas...
How about Bari?
No, I won't wait -- I can't -- Every day is precious -- every hour -- Every minute.
I won't wait -- I can't wait -- I waited three days before I got a room at all and what a room that is.
Did I say I wanted a cheap room to live in -- when I came here did I ask for a cheap room? Did I?
Yes -- He always seems to be waiting for something -- and nothing ever comes.
Yes, I was in the war.
What happened?
What do you mean, next?
Oh come on --
I'll be right back, it's just that this girl is a different girl... she has attacks.
Lucky.
I don't know.
I know.
Did you like her to watch?
I thought you hardly know her.
No.
Who is it?
Your Honor, I don't see a Mr. Roston listed as a prosecution witness.
You're lying. Marsh was wearing a cast on the tape. It was right before he went to Chicago and met Miss Lawson. He dumped you for her, didn't he?
I thought he was a kind, gentle man?
Money isn't the only reason people commit murder, Miss Braslow.
It must have been horrible. Having to go there -- seeing them together - - knowing he was sleeping with her in the same bed he did with you.
Yes. You see, rich people need someone to keep the crowds away. The world's full of pests. Then there's the newspapers to handle. One must know when to seek publicity - and when to avoid it.
Why should you?
Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington.
Yes, indeed. I wonder why he left me all that money? I don't need it.
Buffer?
Mr. Cobb here is an ex-newspaperman associated with your uncle for many years - as a sort of buffer.
Of what?
Nah.
Well, whenever I run across a funny name, I always like to poke around for a rhyme. Don't you?
Her psychiatrist... said... she needs security now... stability...
After 12 years in the minor leagues, I don't tryout. Besides-- I don't believe in, Quantum Physics when it comes to matters of the heart...or loins.
I know, I moved the Barca-lounger into the corner. It s throwin everybody off. What do you think?
Great room...
You re not even listening.
Oh, I could die...
Perry Como! You had him! Go back! Go back!
It's Perry!
Wait! Wait!
It's Webber. Adam Webber.
OK skip it, Einstein. How come you never got no education like the rest of us?
Thirty-six sev aah I lost the count.
My favorite little cousin.
Shut up. I like the kid. Remember the night he took Farella at St. Nick's, Charley. We won a bundle. Real tough. A big try.
It's good for you. Develops your mind.
Aw, you know I don't like to count, Johnny.
Uh... Ah! A story?
Yeah.
Anderson.
Walker and Williams.
What did you think you were doing in his tent?
Yes. Dropping off.
You shouldn't go into another man's tent. It's inexcusable.
Looking for the fossils. Why should we wait until we're in London? This girl was probably twelve years old.
What did you do?
Her hands and feet were tied.
Just keep it someplace safe, but handy.
'Til they pick up the perp. Seniority gets day shift... You know what that means.
Don't start... The only reason is that the neighborhood's shi... ... crummy. I just don't like the idea of leaving you alone here at night.
Scrambled eggs surprise?
Not great. I've got a babysitting job for a material witness on a homicide.
Now I ca-can't remember.
Let's take a look.
When I'm talking to children.
-- oh yeah... what do you know about this guy?
Listen to me Schaeffer's part of it. Maybe at the top of it.
It was my mother's.
You couldn't.
It's just like my grandmother's china.
Yes, why not.
Nothing just yet
I'll have to come and hear you play. what do you play.
In here with my suntan lotion and beach towel. That's her place.
Just some rich Anglo out on the lake. Don't even live here all year.
All this must be quite a change from Hollywood Boulevard.
Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
You're being ridiculous.
Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
Baloney!
Listen carefully, I wrote the Amish woman's name and address on my desk calendar, I want you to lose it for me, Now. Tonight.
Were there ever any suspects?
What was the weapon?
Routine.
Was his wife ever a suspect?
Do you remember his name?
It's not going to be forever. I figure three years is long enough. I can see it the music pans out. And right after graduation we should start seeing other people. Kind of comparison shop before we settle down and get married. Know what I mean?
Don't tell me you were worried!
How could you forget? We talk about seeing other people and you forget?
You know. About what we said on Tuesday. It makes a lot of sense.
Sure.
Holy Jumping Catfish! You can drive a guy crazy.
Here, let me help.
Nothing. Nothing you'd give two cents for.
Nothing, nothing... Look, I live just over the street -- you could get cleaned up.
Mr. Bartholomew -- are you sure you know who I am?
Dry-cleaningwise, things are all fouled up. I had a good man -- an excellent man on the Rue Ponthieu, but H.Q. asked us to use the plant here in the building -- to ease the gold outflow.
Mrs. Lampert -- Mrs. Charles Lampert.
I'm sorry -- my secretary must have gone to lunch. You are -- ?
Come in, Mrs. Lampert. You're quite late.
When was the last time you gave her money for Wynant?
Right. It's not a classic anecdotes, is it?
Looks like these got a few years on them.
This'll kill 'em.
It's a difficult situation, and I want you to know I appreciate it. Tonight's going to be real tough for me --
Oh, yeah, right. I forgot.
Hey, what do you know. Looks like we can have that drink after all. What's your pleasure? We got the downtown Ramada. We got the Travelodge on Route 41. And ... the Mallory.
I'll take the Mallory.
Good choice.
Right -- want another one?
What did the beer cost?
That's Lubosh, the greatest fiddle player in Prague. You must have seen him playing with Johnny on the bridge. ......Come on, let's grab a table.
Just a boid in a gilded cage -
You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
Bad people.
Machismo?
"Are not capable of love" is what you mean.
You still haven't answered my question.
You're assuming the District Attorney is going to file charges.
What?
I care about the homeless.
You're kidding.
How long have you been waiting to pass that thing?
Three years.
I'm telling you, Bob, it's a gift. When you got a Ferrari you don't leave it in the garage.
Because Kurt doesn't want to work with you. He thinks you're a loose cannon.
This isn't doctor's orders. It's mine. I'm saying you can't come.
Some people think bein' shy is a disease, but it don't bother me.
No.
You know, they say you can tell everything you need to know about a person from the way they act when they re naked.
Mr. Gazzo wants the two hundred now!
Yeah, I guess he still lives with her. Seemed like a sweet lady -- got diabetes or something -- so I went out on a limb and got him transferred down to Providence.
And you think he could find out her number for me?
You're not on that soap opera thing again, are you? 'Cause you know what that is?
Well, are you gonna answer me? What'd you come here for?
You sure don't. Who do you think you are coming to Hollywood, anyway? You should remember where you came from. And who you really are.
That's right. So, if you know it, why are you in trouble?
I didn't ask you all that, Sweet Pea. I asked if you loved her.
She's the sweetest person I've ever known. Loves kids. Works with handicapped kids every afternoon at the church. Everybody loves her.
You should've done what I did. A clean break.
Listen, I'm not going to go to that little reunion party. I'm meeting Lynette at the motel. Best head in fifty-two states. After three days of survival training, how could I resist?
Lynette told me it really tore her up when you didn't call this week.
Thank you, Randy. You better leave sweetheart. You might get hurt in here.
Oh, how do you do?
And you already know Herr Heinze of the Third Reich.
Rick, this is Major Heinrich Strasser of the Third Reich.
How do you do, Mr. Rick?
You repeat "Third Reich" as though you expected there to be others.
Well, personally, Major, I will take what comes.
And his message was "Together, no matter what?"
It's good to see you. I'm sure you're curious about what I've been doing.
So ya see, I won't be in the mailroom long.
How long've you been down here?
Jim?
It's a place where religious people--
You're kidding? What did they say?
I sincerely hope you are not going to marry Jessica.
They told me they don't help out stalkers. Look, maybe they're right, it's been a long time.
I got it -- you hire a private eye, fly him out there, he follows her around a couple days, she'll never know a thing.
What do you mean, what is it? It's some political bullshit.
Wait a minute, God-damn-it. Do you think I want to go to some God damned party? I'm trying to get that God damned shop open. I'm trying to get a little bread together. That's all I'm doing.
A business meeting, I told you that.
Look at the way I live.
Yeah. I guess so. Did he say anything? Before the coma?
Just the name of this hospital, St. Severin. He repeated it a few times then he lost consciousness.
Why would he pick this one?
I don't know. There were others much closer. He was religious?
Not that I know.
Well, when you're about to pop off, what have you got to lose? Thanks for your help.
Yeah, but you talked all the way from GCI to the turnpike. It sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.
You like the wild ones, don't you? Tillman, Nicolet and now Foley. You know, I've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.
The letter --
It still doesn't make sense, but it isn't worth any quarter of a million either. Have we forgotten anything?
The tooth powder. Wait a minute -- could you recognize heroin just by tasting it?
Relax, this guy owes me a big one. A couple years ago he got in a jam up in the Boston office; some bullshit about padding his resume -- like we haven't all done that. Anyway, they were going to let him go but his mother wrote a tear-jerker letter that ended up on my desk.
-- tried to shoot it out with the cops but his gun wouldn't work, so --
Huh?! He -- no, I -- he's just -- maybe I was a little rough on the boy, ya see I --
I love you, Adam.
His mother?
The greasy pole.
Orson Wells? What about Doctor Lizardo?
The Ostrich is a detour. A poor man hunts an ostrich, it's the method. Nothing to do with Zerzura. To catch an ostrich you must appear not to move. The man finds a place where the ostrich feeds, a wadi, and stands where the ostrich can see him, on the horizon, and doesn't move, doesn't eat - otherwise the ostrich will run. At nightfall, he moves, fifty, sixty yards. When the ostrich comes the next day, the man is there, but he's nearer. Haunting the ostrich.
Stole his body? When Doctor Lizardo's hair turned red and his mind snapped? Of course! What else?
The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
Her mind is set. She won't change now.
Look! He's right on top of us. I wonder if he is using the same wind we are using.
I m a hooker.
Whoever he is, he's too late -- -- see? The Cliffs of Insanity. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 19.
How long have I been here?
Oh, you're wrong. He told me --
Shoot to kill, I said.
What?
Nobody reprieved that policeman he murdered. Now, do as I tell you.
I don't know, Fred. There's that reprieve if they ever find out.
Look, let's forget it. Let's forget the whole thing.
I get one hundred a day plus expenses.
You hot shit. Ya look fuckin' pisser.
Pact? Pact? NO LIFE SUPPORT??
Y'see, Stu, as I understand it, you made this pact with your sister...no life support?
I've told him. I've told him over and over, but he's out of control.
He was down in the shop.
Too bad. He says I'm a communist.
O-o-o-okay, Lee. Okay, okay. You, you, y-you've said enough. It's my responsibility now. I will work things out.
But-but, but how about you? Do you, do you share any of my feelings? Or is this just an unpleasant embarrassment to you?
W-well, please be candid. I, I-I don't want you to feel bad.
Tch, w-well, for a million reasons.
Tch, no! We were, we were both going in different directions.
What's up, Dixie Chicken?
I know you don't. That's the point. I'll say no more.
It's an experiment.
Dad, come in.
Exactly three weeks to the day.
Right. That gives us...
Yeah, sure.
Judy, I just want you to look nice. And I know what kind of suit would look well on you.
You must be discouraged.
Sorry, no. I just got one.
Yes, Mrs. Pressman.
Originality is my speciality.
I know. Tell me something. Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time?
And what is that worth, the promise of a woman? You're very funny, Highness.
And that's the way the game is played.
Y'didn't?
We can reach an understanding on this.
Good heart, at what?
Thank you, Rose.
Out--
Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still, Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Here's much to do with hate, but more with love. Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate! O any thing, of nothing first create! O heavy lightness! Serious vanity! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead-- Dost thou not laugh?
Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Reason? What reason?
Why do you have to see him?
I'm a Catholic, you know, and even to think about suicide is a terrible sin.
Yeah, we have something great, Vick.
You fuckin' rule!
Hey...
Yeeeeeeeaaaawwwwww!
About the other day...I've been thinking.
It's like a six or seven hour drive. That's easy, I don't mind driving.
I don't know if you don't know --
-- Oh yeah.
-- White ladies?
Don't think.
God, I never thought of that.
Drive off your back leg. You pitch with your legs as much as your arms-
I thought I was--
This is crazy.
Gladstone's got his party facing the same way for the first time in years. We need help. Where is the old girl?
Don't worry about it.
What's with her?
Okay, let's go over it again. You met a girl, you fell in love...
For a month.
And we're going away for a holiday.
Jackie... Jackie?... answer me, for God's sake, answer me.
'The one' to do what?
Get what?
What the hell are you talking about?
I'm sorry --
Yes what?
You got a problem all right.
Get out of here!
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?
How?
I gotta figure some way out of this thing!
Like what?
I ll fix it. I ll go out right now and get you something. I ll make it right.
Vada, I know that traditionally you're not supposed to do a lot of these things before you're officially married...but these are very, very special circumstances.
Whatever you do.
Very well, I'll watch.
Oh goodness, no.
How nice you look. Is that your uniform?
George...
Okay.
Darryl. He's alright, kinda corny.
Huh uh. This dozen is for Mickey.
Don't call me Antoine. My name is Wally.
You can't be serious?
And you're gonna solve the mystery?
How's it working, Scotty?
I'm the one what?
Goodbye ...
The Little People?
Well... that's wonderful -- I'll stop by there for a drink.
Does she know where she's going?
I wasn't thinking. I just did it.
Big gamble with a thirty million dollar plane!
Why?
And?
Lasik surgeon, actually.
Don't shoot!
What?
No.
Willow!
Don't talk about Elaine?
Okay, "bro," this jig is up... Just get in the bottle. Just slide right on in there.
Oh. Sorry.
So old Elaine Robinson got started in a Ford.
Listen, thank you. Thanks for everything. But I've got to go.
The Mask.
Now's when you tell me who you really are.
Come on Peggy. Say what we rehearsed.
...to record how much we love each other. Sitting beside me is the cutest majorette in the history of the world. And she would Like to say something.
But you love me don't you?
And we're here on the couch...
We're here on the sofa bed...
And nothing will ever change that.
No --
What's the matter?
I make maps.
I don't understand.
I understand.
No.
She's nothing but a whore.
At the rate he started, he's probably passed two state lines by this time. The exercise is good for him.
I'm finished with her.
Yes I do.
I don't know.
Says you were a bully...
That's what it says. You drank too much, you picked on me for being passive and timid.
I must go to England -- at once.
You see, I'd like to take a secretary with me for my correspondence and -- humm -- humm -- for company on the trip -- I'm nervous -- I need somebody -- I don't know if you quite understand me. You said you have travelled with gentlemen -- and I mean --
I'm going to keep an eye on that Kringelein fellow. I'll find out where he gets the money to hang around the Grand Hotel.
Yes.
What do you think your salary would be -- for such a trip?
That was big of him.
Nothing for a while. You forget, I'm a man of independent means. Or fairly independent.
Money? Yeah . . . well, a little.
Why?
I won't lose you.
What about your mother?
I hear you talk when I'm waiting!!!
How ya doing?
Come on, Jack, shall we go?!!
Jack, we'd better go.
What do you mean? I'm starving.
Apparently so.
In a minute.
The same, alas.
Will Shakespeare!
A lowly player.
Oh my lady, my love!
He is, bar none, the greatest actor working in martial arts movies ever.
Then putting them together. So truth is revealed.
What about this?
If anybody asks, tell them the truth-- your family disowns you. You are a disappointment, Jerome.
I have to know where you come from.
At least you're honest. Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
Land! Are you crazy? I'm no Amishman and I'm no farmer! I'm a cop. That's what I know and that's what I do!
That's your way, not mine.
You could say that. And Friedman left this morning for Los Angeles.
Thank you for coming. Come in and close the door, will you?
The Hyatt...? What s that?
Ho-hotel... Los Angeles... He...
This has been quite a night. Here's a thought. Why don't we go home and give our private parts a workout?
Are you okay?
I... uh... have a date with someone Friday night.
Oh yeah.
Oh yeah? I mean I know.
Well, George, you may not think ten or fifteen grand means much to me, but I invest for myself and a lot of particular people.
So I'm going to want a little more of your thinking on the subject.
When?
I told you you could write, Josie Geller.
Baby, don't do this --
No.
Well, I ain't sleepy either.
Three kung fu movies.
She's in a great deal of pain.
Not time yet.
Like do you believe in heaven?
It's a long ways yet. I figure we ought to camp. She's tired.
Derek Mantini!
Honey, we can be happy and poor together.
I've got to leave Malkovich.
I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it.
I promise your lordship a good flogging if you even so much as go to Doolan's farm to see him.
Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is a lot of money. That must have made you pretty angry?
See what?
There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
Well, you know we're going to be very busy tomorrow. I'll tell you what. Let's do it tonight. Right now.
Brain. soul, I'm telling you, Lotte. I was right inside him looking out. We're going to be rich.
What?
I'd blame you. I want you here.
Let's see... Fabrizio's got niente. Olaf, you've got squat. Sven, uh oh... two pair... mmm. Sorry Fabrizio.
Well, let's rock and roll.
Okay, just point me in the right direction next time.
Come on, there's like ten million people in this city and the clock is ticking.
This is intense! And it happens every day? Sometimes twice? I gotta tip my hat to you people!
Look, it's okay for me to shit the street. But you gotta use a toilet.
Thank you, no.
Like a club. Work less, make more.
And you could be... sort of like... a father figure to me....
We could be working together, making big money, killing important people... I'm willing to let you in on the ground floor.
Let's shut up and not kill her.
It's a free-market evolution. You'll wake up to it... c'mon Kid. We used to run together when you were a rookie. I don't want to run against you. This thing's real. Everybody's in.
I'm gonna get you, kid.
Maybe your tongue...I don't know, my mouth is numb. Why did you do that?
You have to ask like that?
I've taken a lot of morphine. Oral morphine...for my back. Can I wait till I can say no and sound convincing?
I'm really glad you think so.
Because she doesn't know what a hint is.
You're not in a very good mood.
The play's in a couple of weeks.
No no.
Frank?
What's with Charlie?
No caviar for me, thanks. Never did like it much.
I see. Junkyards. What is the fascination there?
Just a soupcon of lemon... ...it improves the flavor with champagne.
I was.
Did you buy some clothes?
Good evening, Gaston.
I will do my best.
He takes good care of that.
Yes.
No, though the mere thought makes my mouth water.
Never answer the phone. Ever.
Oh, my love You ran from me before.
Oh, no. Nothing's wrong. Everything's fine! So there's gonna be a new order of things, huh? Everybody's gonna cut himself a nice, fat slice of the John Does, eh? You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot you forgot me, the prize stooge of the world. Why, if you or anybody else thinks he's gonna use the John Doe clubs for his own rotten purpose, he's gonna have to do it over my dead body!
No you won't! You're through deciding anything!
But you don't know yet, so your negativity's a bit premature, wouldn't you say?
They probably think my book is such a piece of shit that it's not even worthy of a response. I guess I'll just have to learn how to kiss off three years of my life.
Don't come over the top. Stay still.
Been checking your messages?
Could be anything.
Huh.
Obsessively.
Just trying to be helpful. It's all about stillness, Miles. Inner quiet.
Shut up.
Mmnn.
Uh... No.
I know I can't speak now because Laura's father died, and I just have to take it because otherwise I'm a bad guy, with the emphasis on guy, self-centered. Well, I'm fucking not, not all the time, anyway, I'm really sorry Jo. But you know, Liz... I can either stick up for myself or believe everything you say about me and end up hating myself. And maybe you think I should, but it's not much of a life, you know?
Only because it's never the time. I can't go on apologizing my whole life, you know?
Your trial, Jeanne. On a charge of heresy.
You ain't gonna begin worryin' about what's bad for you at this hour, are you, sugar? I mean, here you are crossin' state lines with a A-Number One certified murderer.
Okay, manslaughterer who's broke his parole and got in mind nothin' but immoral purposes far's you're concerned.
Life is a bitch and then you marry one.
What it says on the bumper sticker up front. On that pickup.
Almost. I figure we should find us a place to stay and then go eat.
Henslowe, you pound of tripe, in my business I would be out of business if I had your courage, so don't tell me about business
Why not?
You're sweet.
You are late. I've been waiting for you -- waiting.
Call me -- do you know -- would you -- would you like to call me by my first name?
Come here.
And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
You said you liked me.
Sure, Ma, it's okay with me.
Hello, Ma.
I want you to hit all the dealers in town. Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use. Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in Roseburg.
Well, I don't realize it now, I know it all the time, but, but I managed to stick it in the back of my mind...
You think?
Why don't we say we were together?
No it can't be verified. Yes I was alone.
Looks bad, doesn't it, Irene? What about you? Where were you last night?
Oh, come on, Rachel. No way.
Perhaps... but wherever he comes from, I think you should listen to him, because it sounds like he's giving you very good advice.
There was.
Thanks for doing this, Ellen?
Look here, Roderick, my boy; this is silly business. The girl will marry Best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. You are but a boy. Best is willing to consider you as such. Dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. Make Best an apology, and be off.
Why did you come back? To tell me why you ran out on me at the railway station?
I'm sorry I was in no condition to receive you when you called on me last night.
Okay. Okay. Here's what you do.
I can see it all now. This is going to be just like the girl you fell in love with at Fotomat this summer. You bought forty bucks of fuckin' film and you never even talked to her.
That's the idea, Rat. That's The Attitude.
Don't talk to her. Let her know. Use your face. Use your body. Use everything. This is what I do. I just sent out the vibe and I have personally found that... girls do respond. Something happens.
Marsh wasn't alone. We found traces of sperm on the sheets. The toxicology report says there were high levels of cocaine in his blood.
That's what my report will read.
The official cause of death was a cardiac arrest.
I've got a real feeling that this is the fellow.
Here he comes.
You know that Super Bowl party? They changed the date. It's on tonight, eight-thirty.
So charge him with something...who's gonna know?
I gotta go to work.
It's nothing. My men take great delight in routing the enemy. Don't trouble yourself, beauty.
I apologize for the surprise, but the days only opened yesterday and I figured...
I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank.
I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon. Call the group. Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon.
Very simple -- I've always liked the way you dressed, Preysing -- English, isn't it?
They turn out marvelous material in Manchester.
What?
Manchester -- yes. Yes, yes, they do. Yes -- Now gentlemen shall we begin at the beginning? -- Have we cigars -- water and everything?
There's a lot of business to be done with the Manchester Cotton Company. They've the whole English market right in their hands. Have you any connections with -- Manchester?
We have a good many connections in England, naturally.
You asked if there was anything more you could help me with.
You can't marry a teacher, it's against the law.
What problem?
Vivian, I want you to listen to me. The man realized that it would be better for his future and his son's future, if he cooperated.
Dorothy -- what if I'm just not built that way?
...my soul or something. 117.
What?
I can't be nice to a fan?
Didn't mean to imply that you were, sir.
I'm nervous. Malkovich is fighting me hard today.
He's a selfish bastard.
You can never... never... ask me to stop drinking. Do you understand?
Is he big league?
Are you trying to say that I might have killed Charles and Scobie?
I imagine you would've though.
This word is -- regrettably appropriate for the situation. In fact what we -- the Church -- wish to do is determine whether or not this girl is sent by God, as she claims. You understand that we cannot allow just anybody to abuse God's name in this manner...
Your father doesn't like me.
Sometimes I don't even trust me.
It's cold, David, and I'm so alone. The undead surround me. Have you ever talked to a corpse? It's boring! I'm lonely! Kill yourself, David, before you kill others.
You have to believe to have faith.
The Bible. Why should I read a bunch of dumb stories about some ancient guy who supposedly worked miracles.
I'm a werewolf.
She's in New York.
See -- this is the nicest room.
Drop his horse.
I know that cut. You mean there's A waterhole near there?
I know. I came up with it. You look nauseous.
You can break it, can't you?
Yes, I can tell that just looking around. "Boy?" Did you say you were a "country boy?"
I don't know.
Hey, boy--give this man a cablegram blank. Where is your wife?
You wave back?
Well. Yeah. You may not want to.
Yes, yes, the song. So tell me...has it been...hell up here?
You wouldn'ta jumped.
You know... it's getting expensive my analyst... for her analyst. She- she's making progress and I'm not making any progress. Her progress is defeating my progress.
I mean... I tried everything, you know, I-I-I put on soft music and my- my red light bulb, and...
Why the hell couldn t you divorce the man?
Well, baby, I'm George and it needs to be cut. But I don't want to place you in that position either.
They're operating on him. He's still alive.
Yeah, Tangerine?
She's right in the neighborhood. She's upset.
Patrick, we're in the middle of --
Go.
No.
What's new?
Once in Petersburg I was driving down the Nevsky Prospect in my cart and Her Highness in her troika swept down from the opposite direction, and when I couldn't make way quick enough she spat in my face.
Imagine! The niece of the Czar opening the door for us.
That's her.
She says she won't be intimidated by parasites. She called the Duchess a blood-sucking aristocrat and a blackmailer.
Leon, Leonitchka, she is not going to negotiate! She is going to fight that injunction. She's going to make a precedent of it!
We outgrew each other.
What are you two talking about?
Now wait a minute --
Now hold on. I'm not a bit squeamish about what might be under those flowers -- but I don't care to watch two women end up like that dog --
There's no point in taking unnecessary chances. Give me the phone book, Lisa.
I don't think I am.
It'd stick in my throat, Mom. I'm nervous or something--
No--thanks, very much, Mr. Stark.
Go on--Give 'em to your friends.
No thanks, I don't smoke.
Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very...
What happens when a man climbs through his own portal?
Of course, right this way, Mr. Malkovich. Compliments of the house.
Bill, we're businessmen, not the damn mafia. I'll see you in the office. By the way, about your car...
This is Henry James film?
Absolutely -- you're clearly very busy.
Okay.
I just wish it was that simple. We really were in love. You know how it is when you laugh all the time.
--Yes. Actually we just bought that little Frank Lloyd Wright on Pine Avenue... Debi's a social worker and I mow down insurance claims at Aetna--
You don't act like it.
It was just a year, give or take a few days. I mean, it's not like we didn't get along or anything. We had fun, we just didn't have that... that thing, you know? That spark, you know what I mean? You gotta have that.
I'm working on it.
Blow me.
Okay.
Oh. Eh, I like it.
That's really great.
Subways... Perfume... Cigarette... ... Cologne... Carpet... Chestnuts! ... Snow!
Stop it!
STOP IT!
I told you! I won't apologize for who I am.
Both, see you later.
I'd like to talk with you about doing some performance poetry here....A weekly thing.
We should be done by the weekend.
Where's the bathroom?
It would never occur to me to worry at all about you.
I don't know. A lot.
You do act different.
Well, if anybody bothers you, you could just tell me cause I run this street.
She don't know how to box, I bet. My dad showed me how to fight like Ali.
-- So if you think it's appropriate, I'd like to bounce the idea off a few people at lunch --
Finally.
-- But there's such an enormous potential profit-wise given the demographics -- baby boom -- discretionary income in the burgeoning middle class --
...Yeah.
Well, I should be in FLORIDA now! If Carl hadn't gone in to get those stones removed, you wouldn't be here and I'd be on my way to the Keys. On my boat, RELAXING WITH A GLASS OF PORT!! Re-ti red!
Worse... you're in Texas.
-- now to recap, I want to stay in Arizona, I want my new contract, I like you, you're nice to my wife, I will stay with you, that's what I'm doing for you, but here's what you're gonna do for me. You listening?
Exactly. And I'm sitting here with an ant problem, look! And my brother Tee Pee's room is flooded with water. Say hello to Jerry Maguire --
What?
Half.
There it is again. That lousy attitude that got us here in the first place. That "make a statement," do an end zone dance, shake your ass and sue everybody in sight attitude that's dragging this whole country down the drain. They don't owe us shit, Wesley! WHEN YOU FINISH THE JOB, YOU GET PAID!! WE HAVEN'T FINISHED THE GODDAMN JOB!!
They paid us half. They still owe us half...
I know that.
That woman could be in any one of four states. Four big states where the deer and the antelope play, Wesley! We're not in Rhode Island!
Do I deserve this? In the twilight of my career, do I deserve this? I don't think so! I've always tried to do what's right. I never took out anybody who didn't have it coming. I'm a professional! AND WHERE THE FUCK AM I? I'M IN PURGATORY!
AND TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF!
They are? Come on.
Your Majesty --
What do you want, Paula? What do you really want?
She's busy.
Why wouldn't it?
Why wouldn't it?
We'll need our Birth Certificates. I happen to have mine with me. Where's yours?
Or this afternoon. It's a good day for it.
They know where I live, I guess they know what I drive, so maybe we should pick up another car on the way.
Great.
Next week's episode.
I thought it was funny.
Sure you want to keep those in the house?
He drank as much whisky as you did.
Ace the jacket.
Sure.
Sharon, it's late. Can we get to the point?
What's wrong?
Yeah -- what are you doing up?
I agree.
Working. Charlie and I were going over some statements.
You're not eating.
You never eat when you're despondent.
That's a -- that's a pretty big slice. Who do you think you are, General Motors?
Besides wanting to be my lawyer, you also want to handle my investments too?
Well, you see, your uncle didn't bother with that sort of thing. He left everything to us. He traveled most of the time, and enjoyed himself. You should do the same thing, Mr. Deeds.
Well, outside of your regular fee, how much extra will it cost?
Yes. That is to say
That involves a lot of extra work, doesn't it?
Oh - nothing. No extra charge.
Budington. Funny, I can't think of a rhyme for Budington yet.
Yes, but that's an added service a firm like Cedar, Cedar, Cedar and Budington usually donates.
They are? I forgot all about them. What do you think they want?
The gentlemen from the opera are still waiting in the board room, sir. They're getting a trifle impatient, sir.
About what?
I'm just saying that you seem like a smart guy. At a certain point you're gonna do something, and then there's no turning back...
Yeah, in most cases that'd be true.
A lucky streak, huh?
So you're telling me, you've got a gun to your head and you don't think for one second, what if this, what if that, maybe I shouldn't do this, I shoulda done that.
Okay, Jack. Nice doing business with you... Cash is about to take off...
Hey...
What do you want to carry that gun around for, anyway? You're just gonna do something you'll regret...
You want to talk about regrets, you're talking to the wrong person.
How's your room shaping up?
'Take me'...? Where?
This morning was good.
Why?
Are we going to ever see your father?
No.
You do more than try.
Don't stop!
Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
Why, I was just expressing a healthy sexual curiosity.
What'd I do?
What'd I do?
No.
So what s with the nickname?
I think I know. I think we can help. Why don't you start by telling me about your relationship. Everything you can think of. Everything about him. Everything about you. And we'll take it from there.
You guess he's your boyfriend? Or you guess you're having a bad time with him?
How are you today?
Well, why don't you tell me what's going on? Do you mind if I turn this on?
From goats to grapes. That's drinking in the right direction.
It's always good luck to launch something with champagne; a battleship... or an evening.
That kid... the hairdresser.
Not the kids type then is he? Not that broody. You must be pretty miffed.
Why, uh, what makes you think that I --
Of course. Of course. Of course he does. Of course. Thank you. Thanks.
Yeah. I tend to tie up and abandon women I really want to see again too.
Excuse me?
It's a gay cruise line, but I'll be, like, wearing a uniform and stuff.
But this should be exposed. They get	kids here who are just starting out in life and they take them for every nickel they can get. That's what Perry says.
Do you think George is a fairy?
I am a trained performer.
What's that, peanut?
Sounds like the bird we want. All right lads, follow yon raven!
Birds speak to me all the time. What did it say?
Beware.
Do you expect me to believe...?
Like jumping into a fountain in Rome!
Why?
But you tore it up.
I'd still like to see you.
How much for your company at chow?
Well, I guess I'll see her at the convention later.
He doesn't like us.
That wasn't a proposal -- I was just curious.
Yes, but we're divorced.
Please, not on my account.
Well, you go in and you ask for some toothpaste -- the small size -- and the man brings you the large size. You tell him you wanted the small size but he says the large size is the small size. I always thought the large size was the largest size, but he says that the family size, the economy size and the giant size are all larger than the large size -- that the large size is the smallest size there is.
I'm not sure I --
Is there a Mrs. Joshua?
Where is she?
I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
The lipstick thermal camera?
...This man.
...I don't feel heat from the name.
Faux goose down.
Yeah, well, I don't have time to screw around. I got buyers in Dallas, Houston and Vegas who are ready to snap this stuff up.
Yeah--why--
Yeah. So where's the high school?
Where's Dawson High School?
Yes, I am. I'm an archer who can read and write. Who do you want to write to?
Still...
You fill the bill, Bill.
I do? How long will you be staying?
You're not Death. You're just a kid in a jacket and a pair of pants.
Yes.
Death!
Sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. There's no point in looking back. At the time, Stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock -- then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap --
I asked you a direct question! A glimpse of what?!
Can I help?
Oh, how is he?
Yeah?
Great.
'Big'?
I guess so.
Hello.
Business folks.
Just you and Quincy, baby. I got a meeting.
What? Oh, and, uh, don't say "shit."
Cause when you say can't, you ain't a man.
That's right.
"Can't" should never be in a man's vocabulary.
Gee... that's wonderful, Jill.
What did you say your name was, sweetheart?
She said she was in Arizona, did she?
Why do I need to see this? Did he ask you to...?
Wait a second, are you like the Steven King of France or something...
So you came after all. Just in time, it's getting interesting.
You didn't know? But then why did you... well, don't worry. It's relatively mild.
Yeah, well if I claw my face off, just pack it in ice, okay? Jesus... the cops were probably right. My uncle was messed up with a bunch of fry brains and they went berserk on him.
Not you too -
You do not report for duty unless the Queen requests it. You know that very well.
Awaiting my orders.
The last date I had was twenty years ago.
Nothing, I'm dressing.
I'm very nervous.
A partner with secrets isn't much of a partner.
On what? Another job?
And no boys, promise me, oh those LA people are all so corrupt you'll end up pregnant and on drugs...and don't come running to me when you wake up in the city morgue with a tag on your toe having been beaten up into an unrecognizable pulp by some surfer...and DON'T make eye contact, it communicates an implied vulnerability.
No, he...got some news today. He'll be okay, he just didn't feel like coming tonight.
Well, what d'you know?!
That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
I still don't know what you're talkin' about.
Used to be. On the railroad.
Not a soul.
That's the kid.
Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
Big see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
Well, wait and see.
Do I? I'm a little confused.
'Horse and Hound.' The name's William Whacker. I think she might be expecting me.
He better be kidding!
Yeah.
It means...I'm a paranoid nitwit who's never let his baby girl out of his sight for the simple reason he's a paranoid nitwit. So why don't you just say quot;Oh Dad quot; and get on the damn plane already?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I think that'll be fine.
Not very well.
That's more like it. Goodnight, old buddy.
The word is "everything." Now what time does my plane leave Tuesday?
I don't care where it goes -- just as long as I'm on it.
Gunnison?
It's me.
I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
What's he like?
You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
Good-looking?
Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
Yeah, but he was successful.
Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
I think you'll approve.
Just one? Christ... I hope it's appropriate.
Are you okay? I wish I hadn't told you what I did. But I can't help the way I feel. You don't hold that against me, do you?
Oh that, she just likes to play.
I give.
Elmer's Glue?
The elderly have so much to offer, sir. They are our link with history.
I don't want to be your godamn link, damn you. I want to feel Floris' naked thighs against my own. I want to know passion. I want my body to inspire lust in that beautiful, complex woman. I want her to shiver in a spasm of ecstasy when I penetrate her. Oh, God, the agony of the flesh, Schwartz.
Don't toy with Floris, Schwartz. Why, if I were eighty years younger, I'd box your ears.
One hundred and five. Carrot juice. Lot's of it. I swear, it's almost not worth it. I piss orange. Oh, and I, have to piss sitting down... like a godamn girly... every fifteen minutes. But nobody wants to die, Schwartz.
Not at all, Countess ... There's one very good stone in it.
And what does this do to our bargain? I cannot afford the piano if you mean me to pay.
No, no payment. I have given it back. I don't want it.
Well, I doubt I want it very much myself.
They're nines.
Right.
You can buy new ones tomorrow.
Hey.
I almost saw Catalina.
I'm hungry! Where's my dinner? Who ate my dinner? Huh? Who's in trouble now?
I thought you wasn't comin'.
What's this?
Really nice. Shouldn't that be a good thing... telling someone, 'no thanks required.'
She's nice.
"What?" Look at you... You sense a mark.
Everyone at work heard you.
Bend over?
I can't very well leave without a pair of water wings.
What?
Okay. Then get set for the story of my life -- not that it would ever make the best-seller list.
No -- not yet.
But then if we sit back and wait, the field should start narrowing down, shouldn't it? Whoever's left alive at the end will pretty well have sewn up the nomination, wouldn't you say so?
Carson Dyle didn't have a brother.
I can explain if you'll just listen. Will you listen?
You can be and are wrong.
It's a start, anyway.
I don't understand you at all -- one minute you're chasing me around the shower room and the next you're accusing me of murder.
Did you have trouble performing? Yeah, that's...
Shut up! Shut up, Jack!
Let's leave it alone.
What is she shooting?
Oh, that's nice... We'll need some new lines.
What kind of pies do you have?
So, the end of the story is...you had to kiss the guy for twenty seconds?
I can't think of anything to say that's not cheesy.
...excuse me?!
Lookin' to make the papers, John?
I'll have you out in a few hours.
You can't show intent.
Can you?
Oh well, duty calls. Time to add another chapter to my work of art.
Care to make a wager on that?
What are the terms?
Could you be more desperate to read it?
What? Oh -- no -- I'm just --
And if I win?
You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?
Get out!
You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
Naw...
"Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?
By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies-- I'm through with one night stands.
I won't have to.
Thirty-two.
Couple thousand. Most of them evil
She didn't give me a chance.
She said she knew where to find him, and then she grabbed my car keys, and--
But Faith--
You've come to lecture me?
Good. I'll call the concierge. They can get you a new room, book your flight home, so forth.
For God's sake.
That old pirate Chiang Kai Shek personally took this to Taiwan when he was run out of China in 1949. Peking would dearly love to have this back...
The Empress Death Mask.
It's not for sale.
From my dad's side of the family.
I like to think so! It's this little idea I been working on!
She's very pretty.
Cecil! Cecil, there's a young man in there...
Wish I could say the same thing.
Oh, uh... Buzz... Is it important?
Which ought to be about three hours more, I'd say.
And your arrest. You'll each get about ten years, I think.
And so do I!
Anything.
It dies. We live.

That's true. What are you?
Out getting coffee.
Bob, do you remember Mary?
'Least you admit it.
I have acted as I think fit.
Some gave me a dress. You know what's great? What I'm learning? You win a war and you not only gain the miles you get the moral ground. Everywhere I go, we're in the right. I like that.
Something smells so rich. My stomach is heaving -
That's a different dress.
What if I asked you not to call me Shooter?
Ice?
What did you pay Nilsen?
Hey Monty--you think we'll get any business today?
Okay, but Jimmy, when the house is rockin', don't forget the knockin'!
What did I do to you?
You tell me.
You're concentrating awfully hard considering it's gym class.
Tell me about Professor Goldstein.
They were drug buys. I was a vice cop.
Listen, I want to talk to you about the prom.
Calm down! We just have to ask ourselves, where your books come from.
They obviously have no sense of historical perspective either.
Getting off please.
I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
That was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.
Floating to Catalina.
Who?
Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
Don't ever talk like that, Fran! Don't make yourself out to be cheap.
Coming?
Stop that, Fran.
Don't forget to kill the lights. See you Monday.
You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has.
I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. And you'll get one, too.
Is there a young Tim?
Well, then, why do they call you "Old Tim?"
Open up there, will you!
There's nobody here.
How??
Mallory, what did you think of Mickey's plan? Did you think it would work?
Love this car! Is it new?
So you'll believe what I tell you next. Because I need to find Jerry. And I don't think I can do that without you.
You haven't been bothering them, have you?
They'd been out dancing all night and he took her to the train station -- she lived over in Brookhaven. Usually held ride with her, but this time he didn't. Anyway, he starts walking home, only as he's walking he starts getting nervous.
By the time he gets to the corner newstand, he's got her meeting some rich guy on the train, the rich guy's asked her to marry him, and he's reading about it in the morning edition.
He had a mind that escalated things.
I don't know. Maybe he thought some rich guy was gonna try and call her.
He calls her, asks her to marry him, she thinks he's crazy, he asks her again, she still thinks he's crazy but says yes anyway, and the next thing you know he's got his brothers down there and they're tearing the thing right off the curb.
Ma didn't want it around. After.
I've got the forensics fella coming down from the Rangers. No way to know how old the body is without some lab work.
That ring--
Old bullets. He uhm-- makes art with them.
I hereby surrender my duties as keymaster, give me a beer.
Is that a fact? Well then, Grace, could you tell us what form of martial arts it was that Tim was schooled in?
Maybe we should sit.
Yeah. Definitely.
Well, this was another way to go.
Your Honor -- the prosecution has introduced cocaine as one of the contributing reasons Mr. Marsh died. How it may have been introduced into the household is of vital importance.
How often do you use cocaine?
You never had The Talk, did you?
You know, I was talking with your father before...and I was telling him that it's ironic. I-I used to always have Thanksgiving with Hannah...and I never thought that I could love anybody else. And here it is, years later and I'm married to you and completely in love with you. The heart is a very, very resilient little muscle. It really is. I... It'd made a great story, I think. A guy marries one sister... doesn't work out... many years later... he winds up married to the other sister. It's, you know, it's a...
Oh. You look so beautiful.
When'd you get here?
Now don't get nervous. It's just your husband.
That can't be right. My birthday's tomorrow.
I said not as a rule.
I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
Alright, whatever -- but since He's not going to come down and cut it himself, at least let someone cut it properly!
Since I've been stationed here? A fistfight now and then--
Have we had trouble there before?
Yeah. You know, Baxter, I envy you. Bachelor -- all the dames you want -- no headaches, no complications --
What're you talking about? They love it.
Don't prove there was two lanterns. Coulda been the one in the cabin.
Wait a minute. I'll do anything you ask me, Anne, but I will not live
Listen to Miss Smarty Mouth. Out there in the free world.
See you tomorrow.
It's been a while.
Pretty much.
I'm nauseous. Oh, jesus, now I don't get to do the TV show?
Oh, oh, no, I can't-I can't eat this. I'm nauseous. If you could-if you could just give me something to get me through the next two hours, you know I-I have to go out to Burbank... and give out an award on a TV show.
Christ!
By the way, I left some trash in your locker.
No, I don't think so... I was having a nightmare. Wait a second...
Erin, it's just a meeting.
Hello?
You win, Colonel. Here's the fifty. Go on out and get rid of it.
Hey, you guys...
Who's your friend?
Great. I was wondering, how do you guys go to the bathroom in that thing?
I can see why.
I got a fax today from your friend Hiromix.
No. I admire you. I...I fell in love with you the first time I saw you. I did. I think that you are the most--
I've never lied to you. I've maybe let you believe things that you wanted to believe, but I've never lied.
All right. Let me tell you the whole thing. In 1962--
You still owe me ten bucks from last week, if that's what you're working up to.
Am I dreaming this? Are you a dream?
You are --?
You're coming to 'take me'. What is that? Who the hell are you?
Nothing. Not even a stick of gum.
-- yes, we're all trying to do something to make this a better country to live in, believe it or not.
She should not have done this, Stan. As mad as she was... as justifiably --
So, how long do you know Janet? Where do you know her from?
When a man has no profession except the one he loathes, what's left? I began looking for people with more money than they'd ever need -- including some they'd barely miss.
What do you mean?
After I graduated college I was all set to go into my father business. Umbrella frames -- that's what he made. It was a sensible business, I suppose, but I didn't have the sense to be interested in anything sensible.
Go on.
It led me away from umbrella frames, for one thing. But that left me without any honest means of support.
I suppose all this is leading somewhere?
Why don't you shut up!
Fiction or non-fiction?
Hildy, from this time on no tricks, no double-crossing -- everything on the level!
Well!
Didn't you always say gambling's An honest trade?
Uh, well, you just said you were going downtown.
I. Don't. Dance.
I'm going to look around.
I'll go outside and take a look in the garage.
I certainly hope so.
So sorry.
Just 'grazed' you, huh?
Arachtoid.
We will, old fried, we will.
Thanks.
Mary . . . Mary, I'm sorry. I've got to go.
Not with all your money!
At least stay for a drink. This party's for you.
Sure. W-w-w-which way yuh goin'?
We have an arrangement now.
I don't believe he did it.
Well, wait a minute. You married him.
What?
I mean it doesn't sound like it could be much worse. If you hated him at least you'd hate him.
Well you loved him once, I assume. When you first knew him.
Well how do you feel about him, then?
You wouldn't be a widow long.
Cole...
...a little, uh, hey! A little hug! What is this? Now how 'bout a little action from the kids?
Yeah, aren't you like, you know...
I gotta see new comedians later, I've gotta--
How is everything?
Will you be good enough to look at this bag, madame?
All right, but you didn't excel in your studies...?
Ooooooohh. Now we're getting somewhere.
Does it work?
Aghh... I'm supposed to umpire a little league game tomorrow.
I'm telling you they're probably friendly.
It's not that easy, Wayne. Donuts and a smoke only get you so far. You're gonna have to do your job.
He does.
No, no, no.
Hello everyone.
By the way, how is your German?
Well, well, sure... because he's a singer and you're a singer, you know, so it's perfect. So you're trying to suffocate yourself. It-it makes perfect sense. Uh, uh, that's a perfect analytic... kind of insight.
Sinatra?
Yeah?
You cried? I've never once cried. Fantastic...
I whine. I-I-I sit and I whine.
Joe sounds like a ringer, Bill. I have the feeling you guys got the broad strokes already. Need any help with the details?
Say, buddy! Who's the most liquid businessman on the street?
So you need to change, right?
Dad!!
What are you pouring tonight?
Ah, there's something poetic about the simple processes of labor. Counterpane, blanket, blanket, sheet, sheet... it should be set to music!
Have you?
I guess it is eight forty-two.
It does. Feels right.
Fear and ignorance.
You will. Look, Nuke--these Big League hitters are gonna light you up like a pin ball machine for awhile-- don't worry about it. Be cocky and arrogant even when you're getting beat. That's the secret. You gotta play this game with fear and arrogance.
I know. I just like to see you get all worked up.
No. Fear and arrogance, you, hayseed, not ignorance!
It's the best, Nuke...the absolute fucking best.
Maybe you do. Y'know I'm starting to like this game--baseball's a helluva good way to make a living.
I WANTED TO FUCK HER, THAT'S ALL!
Why was it you never took her by force?
Look at those eyes.
Probably.
Will she come back?
It started about three months ago. Right after the government sold the expedition. We were ready to go home.
She has materialized from your memory of her. What was her name?
Dead?
Are you ok?
I'm not sure. It started with Gibarian. He locked himself in his room and refused to talk except through a crack in the door. He covered the video lens. Obviously we thought he was having a nervous breakdown. I don't know why he didn't tell us he had somebody in there. By this time, we were getting visitors, too. He was desperately trying to figure it out. Day and night. Who was she?
Yes I'm sorry.
Am I not obligated to?
Let's go to the hospital.
When I left the crossroads, I got ambushed by an elf!
Yeah.
I vote we go back to The Slaughtered Lamb.
Shit! David, what is that?
Heathcliffe.
It's a full moon, 'beware the moon'.
No, but he was on the moors.
Come on, where?
I don't know. Come on.
Now Willow, I know you're gonna blame me for this but it wasn't my fault...!
May I help you?
You look great. Hey, Mare, do I have a rip in the back of these pants?
Beautiful.
Marvelous.
Because you're nuts.
What?
Smythe, I'll get this. I'm expecting some friends.
I don't remember saying anything like that -- exactly...I don't know why I just did.
That's not it.
Joe, you do get around.
You know each other?
What?!
Well, I guess he's found one.
Good. How long will it take?
What do you charge for company, Vivian?
Where?
I know. It'd have to be a pretty big deal to get you to mainline tequila. You don't seem like the type.
I thought you were above all that
Now listen, Swana... I sold Monsieur Guizot the idea of publishing your memoirs in the Gazette Parisienne. "The Life and Loves of the Grand Duchess Swana of Russia"!
Darling, I was busy looking out for your interests.
We can forget horse racing, roulette, the stock market... our worries are over! You remember that platinum watch with the diamond numbers? You will be in a position to give it to me.
We can be rich if you say the word. I had dinner with the Guizots last night.
You'd be surprised how many nice people dine with the Guizots.
Was there anyone with you last night?
Listen, lady, we can do this downtown if you --
Why aren't you ready?
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.
You've got to go over the back fence and I'll meet you on the corner.
Till the gas ran out.
Vada, this is an adult writing class.
Nothing. I just prefer the other one.
You drink about sixteen Diet Cokes a day. You re an excellent father, but you feel guilty about the time you spend away from home. You drink bourbon, but you offer your clients scotch...
No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
I m sure you do...
It s okay, Alan. I get it. I m in your shoes, I m thinking exactly the same thing...but here s the thing. Business is business. Wall Street, Main Street, it s all just a bunch of people getting up in the morning, trying to figure out how the hell they re gonna send their kids to college. It s just people...
Bullshit.
There's our man.
NOVA!!
I imagine that's very important. Especially during the moulting season.
Absolutely!
You mean that?
Man! Our first date and already you're trying to get me to change! You French women work quick!
What about food? Even beautiful women have to eat. It's true. I read it. Please? A half an hour? My treat? Pleez! Don't make go out there alone again! I'm begging you!
It's okay. I can see fine.
Come on Serafine. Let's go out. Show me the real Paris, the part that isn't overpriced and overrun with German tourists.
I know! Let's go hock loogies off the Eiffel Tower!
Or a tunnel or a bridge...
Suspicions... nothing but suspicions!... That's the trouble with you! If you don't let me in I'll stand in front of this office of yours and warn people to keep away from Russia!... I'll picket your whole country....
How do I know you don't want to blow up a factory?
What for... why?
Five hundred dollars.
I know plenty.
I haven't been out here for a while.
Well, why not?
If they-they recovered the shells from that rifle.
L-L-Lyndon Johns Lyndon Johnson is a politician. You know the ethics those guys have? It's like-uh, a notch underneath child molester.
Hey... honey, I don't know Earl Warren.
Tsch.
You go by your old house?
Neither can I. Not any of it. There's no reference point for what's going on; it's never happened before. It's a clean break in the fabric of the Universe; a gap. There is nothing to do but experience it, moment-to- moment, and not let it destroy us.
Not this time.
Let me guess. Amy presumed I d forget the rings. I think I m her least favorite person. You know, I am sorry.
I don't want to talk about it.
Anna who? Anna Green Gables? Anna Conda?
Anna Moss.
Anna Moss. Mossy. The Mossy Thing. The Swamp Thing. Is she all green and furry?
Shut the fuck up, Barry.
Yeah, you would say that, wouldn't you? You two have to stick together now. Boners United. United in getting some.
Don't be sad, Barry. You'll find true love someday.
Suck my ass.
Terrific.
Don't worry about it, Dick. Barry's an asshole.
Yeah... Well... I'll see you tomorrow, Rob.
Now hold on -- you're not captain here... on the battlefield perhaps, but not in the royal bedchamber!
In fact, we think you did such a good job, we'd like to extend things a little bit.
I know. Me neither.
Remember about the light you're Supposed to see when you're dyin'?
You were right, Wyatt. They got Me good. Don't let 'em get you Too.
You're on.
David? You call your teacher David?
Oh, yeah? How'd it go?
Yeah?
I pray you: be succinct.
With all due respect, Madame, all France is familiar with your husband. Grant us a moment alone, won't you, Monsieur Prouix?
I assume you've come to plead for clemency on your husband's behalf.
That's what you got me here for at three o'clock in the morning, 'cause there's a spider in the bathroom?
And I know people.
I...FORGOT SOMETHING.
Tht was summation, Your H...
You're not one of them. There's been a mistake.
And who is that?
They can't erase memories. It's a joke. It's a nasty Clementine hoax.
Count this.
I'll tear his head off.
Apollo's a great fighter.
Maybe --
...People talk to me more.
I have a feeling we've just begun.
Well, why does it?
Huh?
So Yvonne's gone over to the enemy.
Who knows? In her own way she may constitute an entire second front. I think it's time for me to flatter Major Strasser a little. I'll see you later, Rick.
Thanks.
Why don't you go back to doing something you're good at... like that Lonelyhearts column? I'll take a refill there, Betty...
Much better, thanks.
Bullshit, you don't.
All I have is hundreds.
Hello?
We oughta stay somewhere outta the way. Not in no Holidays or Ramadas or Motel Six. If Johnnie Farragut's on our trail he'll check those first.
Looks more like the Ghost of the Old South, but we'll try her.
Come look at this.
There ain't no water in the swimmin' pool. Just a dead tree fell in, prob'ly from bein' struck by lightnin'.
Alright. I heard you were in Spain.
Look, I know our paltry little two million in sales is about what you spend on office supplies in a year. And I know some regional trucking company account is nothing compared to a sixty billion dollar merger...
Fell.
Good heavens no. That'd create the very worst impression. You must be optimistic. You must convince them. You know as well as I do that the merger must go through.
Well, don't get excited about it. We agreed that the merger with the Saxonia people must go through.
Yes -- the merger must go through -- But I am used to making my deals on a solid basis. I am not a liar. I am an honest business man -- a good husband and father -- I have a sense of honor -- I have nothing to conceal. I couldn't live happily otherwise.
I'll see you in the morning then, at the conference. Everything'll be all right, Preysing... Don't worry. Goodnight.
I want to dictate my statement for tomorrow. I can't speak without notes. I like to have things down before me in black and white.
I hope you find the figures correct.
Just come down to my place of business, for god's sake. I have people here.
Maybe I'll get off work. I'd like to go.
What a treat.
Well -- I've always thought that you were a very -- nice -- person.
This evening is over.
What do you mean?
Are you always this much afraid of being alone?
Well, why can't you just lock the doors and go to bed?
Take it easy, that's Bill.
I can dig that. Bittersweet perfection. Dogs of lust on leashes of memory... yeah.
Now you're talkin'.
What are you talking about? You were never an alky, you were a cokehead.
Yeah, well when you quit blow, you gotta quit the booze, too.
-- Anyway.
I am Comrade Buljanoff.
This is Comrade Kopalski.
He wouldn't say that. What he would say is "Buljanoff, you can't afford to live in a cheap hotel. Doesn't the prestige of the Bolsheviks mean anything to you? Do you want to live in a hotel where you press for the hot water and cold water comes and when you press for the cold water nothing comes out at all? Phooey, Buljanoff!"
Relax, he just ate.
I can't afford to make exceptions. Once word leaks out that a pirate has gone soft, people begin to disobey you, and then it's nothing but work, work, work, all the time.
No, I know.
"They?"
I know.
Does it bother you to hear?
Sleep well?
You're not selfish at all.
I'm sorry.
Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something. I remember this farm boy of yours, I think. This would be, what, five years ago?
I asked him what was so important for him. "True love," he replied. And then he spoke of a girl of surpassing beauty and faithfulness. I can only assume he meant you. You should bless me for destroying him before he found out what you really are.
Cause she gets scared of all those dead people in her house, and you know that saying, If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, well if she's one of them, she won't be as scared.
No.
Cause she's dying.
God, no. I thought about it for practically the entire flight...
I took the road less traveled, Adelle.
Almost married. And almost a junior broker at E.F. Hutton...
She didn't want me to go to London. We're standing at the airport saying goodbye and she asks me to stay.
No. Absolutely not.
Yeah, come on, let's talk.
I'm glad you're here.
Does she?
Rumors? Rumors? Since when is a breach-of-promise case a rumor?
No breach-of-promise case has been filed. The matter has been settled out of court.
Nice set of Conrads you have out there, Mrs. Schuyler. I was just glancing through this one. What's Michael tearing the paper about?
Barry, you're over thirty years old. You owe it to yourself and your friends and to your parents not to sing in a group called Sonic Death Monkey.
Oh I see, but Gloria doesn't seem to be satisfied with the twenty thousand dollars.
She didn't like the other one, so she picked this one.
I had to follow her to a store.
Bought it.
What did she say the down payment was?
Ellie, it was a formal party...
No, thank you. I -- well, to tell you the truth -- -- I have this heavy date for tonight --
Aren't you meeting Mr. Sheldrake?
I told you all along. You see, you were wrong about Mr. Sheldrake.
For that matter, you were wrong about me, too. What you said about those who take and those who get took? Well, Mr. Sheldrake wasn't using me -- I was using him. See? Last month I was at desk 861 on the nineteenth floor -- now I'm on the twenty-seventh floor, paneled office, three windows -- so it all worked out fine -- we're both getting what we want.
How does it go?
That's very wise.
Goose is dead.
I don't know. I'm so... I can't believe she'd be so goddamn immature!
We have a warrant. To search your boat.
She's punishing me for being honest. I should just go to her house.
Oh, we'll start small... a hundred dollars a game.
Ah -- no. It's fine.
Fine, but promise me one thing. If we use her, I want to direct those episodes. She's my discovery.
Let me explain-
Of course. Naturally when Mr. Harris leaves, I won't see you in this hotel again.
...yeah.
Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
My raincoat's in the back. Put it on.
Then let's go. It's worth 300 just so I don't have to drive.
Every place has hookers, but if this hotel has hookers, they don't look like they're...
Well... I think I saw her soul.
You may feel more comfortable. This is not the kind of place that rents rooms by the hour.
Exactly.
You'd have been safe in San Francisco.
Almost two a.m.
I thought they'd have stopped by now.
How about you?
I know your height, your weight and your Social Security number -- you had mumps, you had measles, and you had your appendix out.
Quit being so negative, guy; 'course we're gonna make it. We ain't never not made it, have we?
The key to my hotel room! I want you to have my baseball cards! And please be sure to pay my bill!
When?
Giving you money makes me want to come.
But we came down this way didn't we? I'm sure we did.
Someone died here. It's tapu.
What's he say?
I like women who wear mismatched earrings.
And Bobby too, I hear...
Yeah... yeah... I guess so... That kind'a money'd get us a long way down that yellow brick road...
Hey... I never said you was a pussy... Always figured you had the big ol' round balls for this kind'a thing... Sure would set you and that pretty little girl up good.
Like takin' candy from a fuckin' baby...
...But DAMN man... This better go smooth.
Few beers is all. Feelin' any better?
That smell's still fillin' this room good.
Gump, you're putting words in my mouth.
His feet shall never cross my lips.
I should hope not!
Very secretive, they are. Keep their feet covered up. Best if you don't mention it.
Dwarves be very sensitive about their feet.
Certainly understandable.
Don't forget your CDs.
Okay, okay. I get the picture.
Uh, excuse me, please. Hello, Rick.
Thanks. You did great. Maybe later you could come back and we could go to Camp David or something.
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.
So, I've got to drop the van off.
Hey.
League record. And he hit the Radio Announcer, a Sportswriter, and the Bull Mascot twice--also league records-- Joe, the guy's got some serious shit.
Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?
The Crash Davis. And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
Get the fuck outta here!
I'm sorry -- I arrived outside -- they thrust this thing into my hand -- I didn't know what to do.
Either withdraw unto some private place, or reason coldly of your grievences, or else depart. Here all eyes gaze on us.
What's the charge?
Switch 'em. Or I'll be dead by morning. Don't want to be dead.
Maybe I can get Thorwald out of the apartment.
I'll try to give you at least fifteen minutes.
Chelsea 2-7099. We scared him once. Maybe we can scare him again. I'm using that word "we" a little too freely, I guess. I don't take any of the chances.
Did you get my note?
I better see you get there.
Well, so long.
Of course they stay. Rick's wouldn't be Rick's without them.
I shall remember to pay it... to myself.
Don't forget, you owe Rick's a hundred cartons of American cigarettes.
Oh, by the way, my agreement with Sam's always been that he gets twenty- five percent of the profits. That still goes.
Ah, to get out of Casablanca and go to America! You're a lucky man.
And Abdul and Carl and Sacha, they stay with the place, or I don't sell.
Hmmm. I happen to know that he gets ten percent. But he's worth twenty- five.
You're late.
You got it.
You know exactly...what kind it is. Come on Rose...what do you want from me?
Mav's a great flyer but....
They play pretty rough.
Why would I like to know if there's nothing I can do about it, goddammit --
No, you were fine.
Well, I found a little more than that. Let me put it this way:... Last night I thought your brother might be dead, tonight I m convinced he is. That said, I have no evidence and I advise you to let the police deal with it.
No, I mean it.
No thanks.
By the way, we gotta go see Ma tomorrow.
It's only a ring. Not a collar.
Funny. Strike a bell?
Uh-uh. How about you? You seeing anyone?
What about that waitress at the Ambassador?
We gotta go, Jack.
So do I.
Dorothy. Ray. A pleasure.
Shhhh now. I like Simon. I like him enough to batter you unrecognizable if you verbally abuse him or so much as touch his dog again. Meanwhile, I'll try and think how you can make this up to him. I hate doing this. I'm an art dealer. Have a nice day. Party!
It was. And it took your sister getting married to get you back here.
You were talking in your sleep.
The little skate-fuckers.
No way.
It's Vince and Justin.
Who's that?
It's rough. But it shows promise. We record a couple of songs right, in a studio. I'll take care of the rest. I'll put out your record. Any profits after recouping expenses get split down the middle, between us and you guys.
Yes way. It's really...
We're not there yet, Justin.
Kat, wait. I don t want you hating me. We ve never had this talk. You know how crap I am at this.
All set.
Father Mclntire. He blessed you at the inauguration.
See? And these are not just ordinary party-goers -- there are professionals in this crowd -- I didn't want any of them. You... You're what I want. Understand?
Great. Now, what do you want to do about it?
What time is it?
I couldn't leave you sitting by the road.
Shoot.
How the hell did you get here anyway?
Flew. Told my wife I was going to a Promise Keepers convention.
I'm sorry, but that's how it's got to be.
Remember our friend Healy? Well, I didn't know where to mail his last paycheck so I sent my assistant by his mother's apartment. Turns out there is no diabetic mom. Landlord said she's been dead for ten years.
And this adversely affects me how...?
That s when I realized I wanted to be a doctor.
Right, right, sorry.
Inigo.
I'll say -- how do I find the Count? -- Once I do, how do I find you again? -- Once I find you again, how do we escape? --
What?
I hope we win...
Yes. He's a diamond in the rough. And I have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.
Is something funny?
Is it you? If I said Moose I look different, fuck, why shouldn't you?
Moose.
First wedding anniversary - what do you call it?
I don't know. Paper. Is it? Paper? I don't remember.
The Germans were here. The Germans were all over this area. They left mines everywhere. Pianos were their favorite hiding places.
Is that a yes?
Watch you don't knock out a fish.
Scotty?
I sabotaged it? You're the one who lost him, remember?
Hell of a way to die.
Alright. The truth is... I thought we had something here.
Sorry about that.
Don't worry about it.
We're about ready to go here. Are you ready?
Well, that's a funny thing to say.
A lot of things I'd like to forget.
'Yes' what?
Her Majesty's routine at Osborne House is not as you will remember it. The Household remains in full mourning and no-one is permitted to raise their voice under any circumstances whatsoever. As for the Queen's routine, she breakfasts at nine thirty, lunches at two,takes tea at five thirty and dinner at eight forty five. No one is allowed to leave the building while the Queen is at home. On the rare occasions when she is out, you may ask permission to leave, but only with my consent. You're to be ready to walk the pony at any time after ten o'clock. You'll clean her outdoor things and do any odd jobs as and when she requires.
Apparently I'm not as dumb as you thought I am.
You are the dumbest person in the world.
Say it, goddamn it!
Whatta we gonna do? He's in an elevator.
We gotta get him outta there.
No.
Don't you?
I don't!
What's waiting for us up there. Tell me or I'll pump two right in your face.
No. No you're not.
I'm sorry?
Dedications. I came up with the idea on the road. See, every morning the maids drop one of these cards in each room. The guest fills out the card, leaves it at the front desk, and that night we play it. Daniels went crazy for the idea. And that's not all. Last night, after the nine o'clock, he corners me, right, and starts asking about our availability. Like he wants to line something up. I think he's got a hard-on for Susie.
Just wonder what she's up to. I never see her. Makes me nervous.
She's a big girl.
Yeah, well, she's our girl now. I think we better keep an eye on her. There's trouble there. Hey, listen to this. Ethel and Bert Lane. Married seventy-five years. You believe that?
What the hell are these?
Order me a pastrami for after?
Thanks, Mary. You can bring her in.
Mary...
You know I saw you on the street.
Really? I was thinking the same thing. If we could call time and get together for a while.
Sorry, Steve, maybe next time. And how's our new guest settling in - ?
Outside Adele's.
Are you kidding?
As long as it takes.
Goodnight.
Don't take it personally.
Look, miss. We're tired, you have gum on your lip, and we're going home.
Punctuality. First rule of show business.
Floris, get Guinness on the phone.
Glooph is not a letter, sir.
Damn, you are good. I tried to trick you. Okay, put these in order.
You think so, eh? Which comes first, L or... Glooph?
Not at all, Dr. Lester. I simply misspoke.
Tell me, Dr. Schwartz, what do you feel you can bring to LesterCorp?
Forget it.
They won't be.
We have to try it. We can't stay here. Melanie needs help. Mother, the house won't take another attack.
I want to try for San Francisco. There are buildings there. Steel and concrete!
We won't be here.
They're gone. The same pattern.
And I am...
Friend Ogg. Excuse our enthusiasm, occasioned as it was by a fondness for you.
Can we, can we go?
Don't, no, please. Will you-- No, don't...
... what?...
What happened to your shades? Someone finally step on 'em?
Oh.
What's that for?
Whose blood you got all over you?
These guys, man, they're crazy. Shit.
It seems to me I been reading about you in the newspaper. Busted out of some joint in Florida, huh?
I've seen him.
What are you talkin' about?
I don't believe you.
They didn't tell me.
Where did this come from?
A possibility.
To yourself, that's where.
Go!
I'm sure.
Tsch, why don't we get... why don't we get Rob, and the three of us'll drive into Brooklyn, you know, and we show you the old neighborhood.
Oh, no, no, I think we're both much too mature for something like that.
I don't know.
It's all right for me, it's been terrific, you know? Better than either one of my marriages. See, 'cause... 'cause there's just something different about you. I don't know what it is, but it's great.
Go on, there's a good boy.
Steve maybe you better get some wood for the fire.
...what can I say after I say that I'm sorry? I zipped when I should've zagged, I opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted --
Come in, Joe -- I want to thank you -- okay, Bill?
Sure.
Joe knew the whole story. I told him. It was his idea that I come clean. I mean I wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what I mean?
Too bad.
Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress.
Okay, Mr. Book.
Elena!...But when...
The army says that, as a war orphan, I don't have to serve in the military, but nothing can be done. It's a bureaucratic error. I have to leave. Day after tomorrow morning. They're sending me to Rome. But they'll discharge me ten days later. Let's go...
What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo?
How old were you?
You've done nothing but study swordplay?
I was eleven years old. When I was strong enough, I dedicated my life to the study of fencing. So the next time we meet, I will not fail. I will go up to the sixfingered man and say, "Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."
I LOVE THIS!!
That's why little things mean so much to him.
He's from Alaska.
Hi, Allison --
Be sorry for nothing.
I've been thinking about you.
Can not do without, Harry's wild about me.
Easy, Bill. You'll give yourself a heart attack and ruin my vacation.
What's that?
Why didn't you tell me? .... Why didn't you hold him?
My grandmother's .
That's where I was last year. She'd never lived alone -- my grandfather died -- I stayed with her. I wasn't in jail, I don't know Marilyn Manson, and I've never slept with a Spice Girl. I spent a year sitting next to my grandma on the couch watching Wheel of Fortune. End of story.
Give it a rest, Lyman.
Where did you meet my father?
Well tell her I said "hi" back.
Okay. I just came in to get warm, myself. Come on, let's go.
What do you know about the Highlands?
I am a blank sheet.
Do you hunt?
Occasionally.
Dare say you can be taught.
To shoot perhaps, but not to kill.
If you hunt, you kill.
Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head. Then imagine it's Gladstone.
Quite.
No, I ain't married. Well, good-bye.
That's pretty good for a preacher's daughter.
Sorry, baby. I'm goin' to Birmingham.
Leave at once --
But you have a vision. Don't you want to help your parents?
I'm talking about invention, no investment. I know what people think of me. Mr. Spasmatician. Dick the Square Root. I'll show them. You said I was going to be a millionaire. And you're gonna help!
Evelyn, take her to her room!
Good good.
Look, uh, I've been thinking about everything you told me.
Yeah, I don't know why but I always felt at home in the fronton.
Jai alai?
Yeah, this insurance business is too slow for me. I'm going to go down and try my hand at jai alai.
Miami?
Oh, uh, I resigned.
What are you doing?
You sure, big guy? I'll bet she'd love to hear from you before her mastectomy!
Uh, that's okay.
Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support.
She's sore hurt, Jack, tis true, but not dead yet.
... the Princess Lili... I've killed her.
Nonsense! Course it matters.
It doesn't matter.
Easily... The question is, can we save ourselves? Be a shame to win the battle only to lose the war.
Can you save her?
Nay. You've not reckoned with the powers of faerie medicine.
The wound is mortal.
The alicorn, lad. Come to your senses! Unless we find Baron Couer de Noir and bring back the horn the world is doomed.
I don't... understand.
So? I never returned your calls, even when we were married. And what's Fisher doing here anyway?
Maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?
Yeah.
Hello -- who is this?
Is the doctor anywhere?
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's brother -- Reverend Smith -- and I am supposed to perform the ceremony. I just got in -- from -- Portland -- and I've forgotten what church -- you see?
Whom you address.
Are you going to England with her Lloyd?
She wouldn't get out of the car. I brought her all the way here, she said she was going to come here, and she wouldn't get out of the car. But I thought that is was important, that she come to see you, because I know that if you go somewhere and you don't deal with your family stuff, then you're just gonna, she's gonna, um...
I didn't know you were going with him.
When did you first find out he was alive?
We'll do that. But how are we going to hold him? He can change himself into a man. He can disappear.
That's the chance we have to take.
You're not hearing me.
You can change a directive, George. You've done it before. Listen to me. He's going somewhere in Death Valley. Lathrop Wells was never anything but a bus stop. East is the nuclear site. There are no roads in there. She was teaching him to hitchhike. I'm telling you. We block the four roads into Death Valley and we got him.
You're a career intelligence officer, Shermin. You'll be in the air with us.
You're talking about taking a life. The most unique life form on this planet. I think we're better than that.
No, we don't.
Then you're going to have to do it without me.
The cowboys were right. You can make money fast gambling.
Are you?
That's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about sir.
500? Sly boots, must be a peach of a hand.
Will! Where is my play? Tell me you have it nearly done! Tell me you have it started. You have begun?
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move
Romeo and Ethel The Pirate's Daughter Almost finished?
Without doubt he is completing it at this very moment.
God be praised! Locked?
As soon as I have found my muse
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose. Where is my play?
It is all locked safe in here
Who is she this time?!
She is always Aphrodite.
Quick question - do you know who I am?
Since when does Ellie need moral supp--
Take a deep breath and realize, that this is me breathing.
Then I've really overshot here 'cause I was aiming at just enough to keep you from walking out.
It's in a cage. Do not be scared of...
-- I give you my favorite animal in the zoo. Are you ready for the weirdness, the strange perfection and truth of...
I'm scared. What is it?
Show me the animal, Jerry!
Right up ahead, buddy --
Shame on you. SHAME on you.
Charlie -- are you going to make a point soon?
You're a monster.
You got something on the Coke?
I'm sorry to barge in -- but I figured after that bombshell that got laid on you today you could use some good news?
Last night. You were talking to someone in the corridor.
Dr. Royer-Collard? May I be the first to welcome you to Charenton --
This may feel a tad awkward, my friend, but it needn't be. I've merely come to oversee your work here; understood?
Of course.
It's a formality; truly.
You're a man of Science; I'm a man of God. Charenton stands to profit from us both, I'm certain.
I'll need an office on the grounds; someplace to store my things.
If you don't mind my asking... why has the Emperor taken such sudden interest in my... our... affairs?
It seems a particular patient of yours has captured his fancy.
Madame Colet, I've enjoyed the confidence of your family for more than forty years. I was a school friend of your husband's ...
Look -- I'll be in there later today. I'll come by and tell you all about it.
No, I'm paying for the dress. Do you think she's still gonna run?
Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.
After you. It's okay. I'm the one who left it here.
This way.
Not today.
Like you couldn't believe.
Look, Dick, I don't -
Naw, two on a Quaalude... bad luck.
Larry, you and your wife got problems?
Sluggish. Like a wet sponge.
It's a damn good thing he doesn't know how much I hate his guts.
I'm going this morning.
I know what he said.
Quaint? Can't imagine why.
Where's the nearest telephone?
No. I'd want a public phone.
That's nothing to do with it, it's the car that's still being run in...
Just so, Alfredo. There isn't any. And if you buy a television set, you can watch it at home, without any fuss...
Toto, are you pulling my leg or something? How is it possible to see this television without film?
Really? In that case, I challenge you to a battle of wits.
Hello Graham -- Joe -- Mr. Gardner.
You guys got the Latin homework?
My hand.
Edie, listen to me! I want you to believe me. I want to be with you.
That word again! Why do you keep saying conscience, conscience... .
How long have you been waiting?
Just a cup of black coffee, please... Hey, ma'am! Wait a minute! Would you, uh, like another cup?
What time does the bus leave?
Yours.
Well, you're right. I guess it wouldn't.
Always a pleasure, Brucie.
I need a cigarette.
Why didn't you tell me?
She's going to cook something for us?
There she is.
Wonderful, wonderful.
Yes.
What's that?
Bad television.
I figured I could pick you up tomorrow around seven o'clock.
That'd be good.
What exactly did you hear?
Yes. Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair!
I'm sorry.
I was attacked.
Two kids tried to set me on fire.
Inhale this, but do not touch.
What gaps?
Sylvie -- ? What are you doing here?
Yeah. Yeah. I get your thought. You know I seen you lots of times before. Parochial school on Pulaski Street? Seven, eight years ago? Your hair come down in
All right -- where's the letter?
What are you talking about?
Vivian, you belong wherever you are. I don't care how you were dressed, they were the ones who were wrong, not you.
Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
What a terrible thing to say. How could you even think that?
It could've happened to anyone.
It's got to be sent to another town. And if we don't the owner of that movie house gets pissed off.
The truth, now -- was it my hide -- or the stamps?
You didn't even have a honeymoon. I promised you . . . . . . Your what?
Lassos the stork! You mean you . . . What is it, a boy or a girl?
If you don't like it, you can resign from the company.
Okay, so I'll see you tomorrow night then.
I did! It was my idea, wasn't it?
5'7", green eyes... long legs... great skin... perfect..
Finger..man..I'm sorry..listen..I was on the way over but I had a fare fall into my lap.. y'know one of those big fares you just can't resist..
Hello?
I don't want his money.
You come up here often?
Where are we going?
I am your friend.
Are you my friend?
He will.
Why?
Eh.
How many times have I fired her?
You're conceited--
What?
How?
On my knife.
You're hand is bleeding.
I cut myself.
Well who did?
I don't know.
You didn't just smash up the bathroom?
No.
Sir, a young man saw you coming out of the bathroom.
I didn't do that.
Of course. How much?
Can I buy you dinner sometime soon?
Expected... offer.
You're making the right decision, sir.
And I don't think that was Tom.
Yeah, but, what if he doesn't live here? Like, what if he's a cannibal in New Guinea or something?
He's holding out on you.
The water was rollin' off me. And I was dirty, too, like I hadn't had no bath in a long time, so the sweat was black almost.
I know. I kept walkin', I headed for your house, only it wasn't your house, really. You let me in only you weren't real pleased to see me. You kept askin', 'Why'd you come to see me now? Why now?' Like it'd been a long time since we'd seen each other.
I know, peanut. But it wasn't all like you were so unhappy I was there, just you were upset. My bein' there was upsettin' to you. You had some kids there, little kids, and I guess you'd got married and your husband was comin' home any minute.
You said you wanted these.
Well, I ain't upset about it, darlin'. Just give me an odd feelin' there a minute, is all.
Now don't be absurd, Smith May I come in?
I don't see anything, do you?
You hear me complaining about that?
That won't happen again. We're different.
I thought you were leaving.
Morning, Hollis.
Sam! Quite a do the other day. It meant a lot to folks that you said something.
Kat, we must talk. This guy, there s something not quite right.
Is that why you brought him? Because of me.
I'd give anything if that were true.
Okay. I feel like I'm slipping but do people who are actually slipping feel that way or is it always the really good people who are moving up who invariably think they're slipping because their standards are so high?
Okay. Let's do me.
Because nobody invites a bad- looking idiot to their bedroom.
I have regrets.
Danny, you know how many times I saw you come to school with a black eye or a busted nose, and couldn't do a thing about it -- for you, or for your mother... or your father, with his lungs scorched out with mustard gas, and more left of his lungs than there was of his spirit? You've made your sacrifice, Danny. It's time I made mine.
Some other time. I don't feel like a party.
I have to talk to Evelyn. And I want you to meet her.
Nah, you go on.
We have to be realistic, Amy. You know things have slowed down a little here at Hudsucker --
Know about it? You think the Board would do anything like this without my authorization? No, this was my idea from the start.
Well yes, we're pruning away some of the dead wood, but if --
Now, Aim --
Your doctor? Did your doctor say anything about a tiny, undetectable hole in your aorta? Did he mention an irreparab- ly weak vein in the further reaches of your famous brain? Were there any prognostications about the possibil- ilites of a fatal collision on a golf cart or suffocating in an avalanche on a ski vacation in Gstaad?
That's the best I can do. ...but minute-by-minute, I find myself lingering.
Shall I call the police, sir?
No! What do you want!!
A farmer, eh! You're a moocher, that's what you are! I wouldn't believe you or anybody else on a stack of bibles! You're a moocher like all the rest of them around here, so get out of here!
Closer than that.
Well, thank you for letting me know.
Everything in order?
All except one thing. There's something you should know before you leave.
Monsieur Blaine, I don't ask you to explain anything.
I'm going to anyway, because it may make a difference to you later on. You said you knew about Ilsa and me.
We'll always have Paris. We didn't have, we'd lost it, until you came to Casablanca. We got it back last night.
And you never will. But I've got a job to do, too. Where I'm going you can't follow. What I've got to do you can't be any part of. Ilsa, I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world. Someday you'll understand that. Now, now...
Look, Clarence, I'm not Joe Cocaine.
But you're an actor. I hear these Hollywood guys have it delivered to the set.
This is Drexl's coke?
Drexl's dead. This is Clarence's coke and Clarence can do whatever he wants with it. And what Clarence wants to do is sell it. Then me and Bama are gonna leave on a jet plane and spend the rest of our lives spendin'. So, you got my letter, have you lined up any buyers?
Yes.
But you didn't know she was at my place last night when you were. She came there for the letters of transit. Isn't that true, Ilsa?
Yeah, they do. And maybe when I start being a successful actor I'll know those guys. But most of the people I know are like me. They ain't got a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of. Now, if you want to sell a little bit at a time -
No way! The whole enchilada in one shot.
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?
What? No. Nothing.
I don't want to erase anything.
Hey, I want ya out instamaticly. -- I'm sicka lookin' at ya hangin' around like a friggin' spider -- Go out -- Live! Do, enjoy life.
Don't get wise with me. I want ya to stop bein' a loser.
Why?
Maybe ya better forget it.
!! Ya want the bird, go out in the alley an' eat the bird -- I want ya outta the house -- Enjoy ya friggin' life... Ya hungry, Rock?
Forget nothin' -- Here, talk to my sister, tell 'er somethin' nice.
Thank you.
I told you -- I quit.
You workin' on another book?
I quit.
I thought you were out of cigarettes.
It must really be somehtin' --makin' stuff up all the time.
Yeah? The sport utility?
Regardless of what you think, Lieutenant, the fact remains that David is missing and that we must find him.
Ho-ly shit.
Hey, this is a pretty nice place.
I did it because because I'd never stopped thinking about you and if I didn't find you I knew my life would never be good again.
Mary, I swear I wasn't trying to trick you.
Okay.
Mary, come on...
We live in a theater?
Only one in town. Get in, son.
And the draft blew over the flowers.
Interesting theory. Where's the proof?
You ordering chop suey again?
Meaning--
Sure... I'll see you around.
I love you, too. See you tomorrow.
Monescu.
Thanks, Josie. This wasn't as bad as I thought.
I'm sure we'll find out soon enough.
And his soul black as the Ace of Spades.
I don't have your number, stop by the shop.
Now we get it down to two words--"next month."
Baked with a butter-lime glaze.
I owe her a call anyway.
Oh, Jesus. Look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.
I don't know. Salmon. Don't you always have white wine with fish?
Doesn't have to be now. Let's go taste.
Let me call Christine.
Why don't we step into any office? There's something I want your advice about, anyway. I have my own office now, naturally. And you may be interested to know I'm the second youngest executive in the company -- the only one younger is a grandson of the chairman of the board.
Really? You mean you wouldn't be ashamed to be seen with somebody in a hat like this?
Maybe if I wore it a little more to the side -- is that better?
Vivian, don't be afraid of what you don't know. That's the fun of it.
Here she goes again...
You okay, honey?
Signora Maria, don't do that. He's just a kid. And why are you telling fibs? We let him in free. He must have lost the money inside the movie theatre... How much did you have?
...what kinda car's Jasmine drive?
If you'd gone on about how much you liked it, I'm not sure I'd have believed you.
I'm not going!
Terrific.
That's great! There's the address and message all in one word.
Then why didn't you call the police? Why don't you call the police? I'll tell you why--you crook, you.
It's a violent response to something we haven't figured out. Don't let the cowardly demeanor fool you: He is ruthless. Unblinking in his prejudice.
Well. He doesn't think it's God, but for different reasons than me. He's thinking: If I can figure out how to make it stop, than I am smarter than it is, and therefore it cannot be God.
He does have a point. That's just not the way I'd like to see it proven.
I know. I'm putting that in my next report.
Have I ever let you down before--?
Don't get all gooey on me now, you'll give me a big head. The important thing, Doctor, is you've got to distance yourself as much as possible without pissing this psycho off.
I know. I'm glad.
Is she home?
How do you do.
She's home cooking the fatted calf. Come on, let's go.
Oh, am I glad to see you.
We'd better talk.
You don't have anything to be sorry about. How could I . . .
We'll go to Venice, to the same hotel!
Two fifty-three, five--
They've the satisfaction only a hard day's labor can provide.
And tomorrow is the fifteenth. And the day after tomorrow--
-- and the listless ones do the binding.
I'm afraid that our endowment has shrivelled to a mere pittance; we're the laughing stock of all France. But -- on a happier note --
Gawd...you're...beautiful...
Because she's sick.
How many rooms do you think there are?
Yeah. It smells like snow.
He's dead. He was a hero in the China Sea. JIM You told me he's a big wheel in New York!
I did? Well, he might as well be dead. What's the difference?
Ever been in a place like this before?
He was a friend of mine. A good guy...great guy. It was my fault.
Absolutely positive.
Were we going to get married?
Tell M'sieu Giron I can't see him now. Impossible! And, Jacques. Dismiss the car! Madame is not going.
Precisely.
But you have an engagement, and I don't want people to talk.
Madame has changed her mind. She'll be down in a minute.
No--yours, madame.
What?
No reason. Well, it's pretty clear that the front entrance caved in when the bomb went off. So, you know, when the time is up, we'll have to return to the surface using, you know, this back entrance. Which is very nice because it has the service elevator!
Yes. Well... yes.
Right here!
Oh, I was just examining this rear hatchway.
Ever get an answer?
Yeah -- frequently -- it ran something like this: "Your request for transfer turned down --"
Forget the story -- find the trunk. Mrs. Thorwald's in it!
Oh -- I almost forgot!
Is -- is Anna -- who I think it is?
Mrs. Thorwald.
Rita. I met her last summer. She's cool. You'll really dig her. She's got this great little cabin in the hills, just outside of Provo where she raises chickens. I'll write and the two of you can take care of the chickens to support us.
-- Now, just a minute. Who told you to ask me that?
Oh, he's just like any other man, only more so.
I should have known.
He is? Well, Captain Renault's getting broadminded. Sit down. Will you have a drink?
No, of course not. Do you mind if I do?
Why'd he have to do that to that girl?
Yeah, Kenneth, why you have to do that to that poor girl.
That was some shit, huh?
It's all right with you, I'll just hang in the car.
No. You gonna stay close to me from now on. So you don't disappear on me.
Why would I do that?
Well...
We'd better light some of those lamps.
Bullshit. Fifteen years, Frank. No one paid us off.
It wasn't like that.
The hell you don't.
I told you. Something came up. Some political dinner or something.
Charlie paid you off last night, didn't he?
I don't know what you mean.
Yeah ... we're gonna paint in the spring. After the rains. Look good as new.
You ask me out here to sell me your house, Frank?
The trees. The flowers. Nice.
Do you mind if I check upstairs?
Did she show up?
Hey Ronald.
I understand. Thanks for letting me crash here.
Can we do it later. I've had a really bad night and -
Oh, appreciate it. I was trying to, ahh, give a sense of history to...
Hi, Betty. You're looking good...
Yeah, it was great. Really put the whole idea of "church bake sales" in perspective...
Supposing I did have it -- which I don't -- do you really think I'd hand it over?
It's about working with what you already have -- right now -- at your fingertips -- you know, spontaneously.
Before we do this, I just want to say that a good life's gotta be about more than achieving stuff -- like on your list.
And I say maybe you both have it! One more time, Dyle -- where is it?
Oh, yeah? People fall toward a shot, you know... not back from it. I knew you were lying.
Don't lie to me.
The stenographer is to go up -- Mr. Preysing telephoned.
What...! --
I wasn't trying to be personal -- it's just that the fellows in the office were -- whether you wondering about you ever --
I thought maybe we could have a bite to eat first -- and then --
Would you like to?
Oh. You mean -- like a girl-friend?
Yeah.
It s because I m shy, Betty. So, when are you going to leave that old corpse Mr. Peterson and run away with me?
Yes, of course, -- money!
That's the way I've always wanted it to be, Elaine.
Oklahoma. Do you know where that is?
Somewhere in the middle.
Wherever you like. Here I'll give you the money I won, three thousand four hundred. Later you can have more.
I don't know.
Why two?
No. It's the junk. I like to look at junk.
What else do you like?
Oh. Well, how do you spend your day?
You mean when I'm not working on a...
Yes. What kind of things do you do?
He is traveling with a lady.
That's very interesting, Harold, and I think very illuminative. There seems to be a definite pattern emerging. Your fondness for useless machines and demolitions seems indicative of your present emotional state, your self-destructive urges and your alienation from the regular social interaction. What do you think? And of course this pattern once isolated can be coped with. Recognize the problem and you are half way on the road to its solution. But tell me, what do you do for fun? What activity gives you a different sense of enjoyment than the others? What do you find fulfilling? What gives you that certain satisfaction?
Okay.
Done. No matter how clever he is, he still needs an exit visa, or I should say, two.
Maybe he's not quite as romantic as you are.
What?
Suppose not.
It wasn't just you, Bunny.
I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
You're not going to take off on me, are you?
Which they do. And we're standing there. All the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an ESPN crew. So I turn to her and sort of grandly say, "Well, this is me, Klutz, asking you, Goddess of Rock Climbing, to marry me." And I took out the ring, and I don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies. We're getting married in February.
Certainly!
and those and them.
You'd really do that?
Sure, sure. You've got a nose, Gallagher. You've got a nose. But there's different women, Gallagher. You know, like brewery horses and thoroughbreds.
Sure. I didn't hear anything.
We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
What department?
No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
He said Wynant tried to steal an invention.
No -- it's not. It's completely baked. It's a decision I've made.
"Neat"! There's that- What are you- twelve years old? That's one o' your Chippewa Falls expressions! "He thinks I'm neat."
I am going to the cops. There's a full moon tonight. Jack was right. I...
Six people mutilated? It had to be me, Alex.
Rational!?! I'm a fucking werewolf, for Christ's sake!
Jack is dead. Look, six people have been killed. I'm going to the police.
Officer, I killed those people last night.
Wait a minute. Do I get from you that she wants to pay me alimony?
You don't seem to understand. Anne doesn't expect anything from you.
Listen Grayson, I've got 106 bucks and 75 cents in the bank. Now Anne can have any part of that she wants, but she'd better hurry because I'm spending it awfully fast.
Unconscious. You know, when you don't know anything. Your natural state. There are some people - you can't buy their self-respect for a bucket of shekels - well, I happen to be one of those guys.
I beg your pardon.
Remember what I told you about that twentieth crack? All right, you've just made it. Before you go unconscious I want you to get this through your nut.
That's putting it crudely, but
Don't think. Let me do all the thinking. Now you go back to that Schuyler outfit and tell them that I didn't marry that dame for her dough and I don't want any of her dough now. I was too poor to buy her a wedding present when we got married, so I'm giving her a divorce for a wedding present. Now, stand up!
We just thought that
M'm, wait, I got a great idea. Hang in there for a second. I got a little-little artifact. A little erotic artifact, that-that I brought up from the city, which I think, uh, is gonna be perfect. I just... there... There's a little Old New Orleans... essence. Now-now we can go about our business here and we can even develop photographs if we want to. There, now there. M'mmm. M'mmm. Hey, is something wrong?
You asked.
You could do better.
Yeah. I liked being around you too... Claire.
Sleep good.
It's never the sea! It's Roberto, Mamma, that stupid actress... Oh shit! Jacques, what do you know?
What's it like?
All right! All right! All right! All right! Whatta yuh mean? Are yuh gonna take pictures now?
All right, here! Oh, God, it's disgusting!
Annie, there's a big lobster behind the refrigerator. I can't get it out. This thing's heavy. Maybe if I put a little dish of butter sauce here with a nutcracker, it will run out the other side, you know what I mean?
You know, I-I think... if I could pry this door off... We shoulda gotten steaks 'cause they don't have legs. They don't run around.
Yes
So, so-well, here's what I wanna know. W-what... Am I your first big romance?
Gentlemen. I think we've calmed down now. Haven't we, Jack?
NO, NO, NO, HE'S MINE.
IF YOU CAN'T SHOOT HIM, I CAN.
Your Honor, all of this is speculation. Including Mr. Hooks' dramaturgy about the defendant issuing a false distress call.
I didn't dive.
I'm pinned to the panel.
Thanks.
Yeah.
I think about that.
I do have a tendency to use that word too much.
Yeah. I think so. It's hard to --
It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana.
There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana.
I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle?
This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen.
I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living.
It looks like it really went over. You're sure making the rounds. Simon says you brought him soup last night. I hope he doesn't write you a note.
Wants to know who the heir is.
I was just thinking... you could have a nice time with him on the plane -- like picking up where your interlude, or whatever you call it, left off. And then throw him in the can.
Oh, but I just told you. --
His escape.
Manages what?
It'll be interesting to see how he manages.
Is that a serious offer?
Twenty thousand francs says it isn't.
This is the end of the chase.
-- Stop it. He escaped from a concentration camp and the Nazis have been chasing him all over Europe.
Make it ten. I am only a poor corrupt official.
I just paid out twenty. I'd like to get it back.
It never happened.
To be my bride, of course.
I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
We're both of us damned, my beauty.
Just out of curiosity, how did they get our address?
It's okay by me, peanut.
Is this your first job?
I can't resist.
Listen, you guys are too attractive to be caterers. Something's wrong.
Excuse me, are there any more claims?
His kid's sick.
Okay I'll see you tomorrow night then.
Right.
You all right?
Yeah, fine.
You wanna get a drink?
He takes after our mother.
This should be amusing.
Can I bum a cigarette?
I thought it was Spanish that you spoke?
I never saw him. I don't think anyone saw him.
Rose is displeased. Mmm... what to do?
I'm sure.
So what? You don't love him, do you? Answer me.
Are you all right with this? You think this is funny?
Good. Settled then.
I thought you quit school. Last I heard you were on your way to a construction job or something down in Brazil.
You were out at sea! Hey, guess what? I graduated. I got my degree.
Hey, honey, look at this! My son! Isn't he beautiful? You should've called!
Neither have you, pard!
Hi, Byron.
No frown lines. New watch?
Why in God's name would I want...?
So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
You want Botox?
I don't need it.
It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
What the hell is Botox?
Would you like a cigarette?
As peculiar as a struggle between a 235 pound man, and an assailant strong enough to subdue him...that leaves only a single overturned cup in its wake?
I got there from "coin," dude. Coin, coin... kwaaaan.
No! I got to find him.
That's right. You got it! Sure! He came in here and I made him change his mind. "Bulletin editor saves John Doe's life." Why, it's perfect. I'll have Ned write it up. Oh, Ned!
He didn't mean it--we shouldn't have left him. He needed us.
No!
I'm sorry, Gallagher - really, I am sorry.
Yeah, I did -- am I dressed okay? I guess I didn't realize we were...
She can't be here because of a... a soap opera. Not a soap opera. That'd make her...
...but she's, no, Betty's smarter than that. She wouldn't be here for a...
Already got a guilty conscience, Might as well have the money too.
Now I know what a unicorn is, what do we do next?
For my hair?
Thank you.
- The Wonder House comma as the natives called the Lahore Museum.
Brick platform opposite the old Ajaib-Gher -
Right. Right. Fair enough. Thanks.
You all take care of yourself, too, Homer!
It's me.
Then, what's gone wrong? Why did it happen?
That much magic I can offer ye, a small measure of entertainment at best. Making the world a frozen hell is beyond me modest powers.
That is correct. Not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at Harvard Law.
Aye. Honeythorn Gump'd be a powerful wizard indeed could he answer.
If you're looking for enchantment, Jack, that I can give thee...
But... but, why?
Why has this happened to the world? Why is it winter now, and dark?
Big question that, lad. Why what?
That's what I figure. Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
Josie... No, I'm gonna call you Sadie.
I could stand some more--
What's happenin' here?
Then let's make sure we get our Money's worth
My mother just called you? Well, how did she know?
I didn't tell anybody. I just went for a walk and happened to be passing by . . .
Okay. It's good knowing this.
Well you'll always be Sadie to me.
... I don't send you men, anymore. You don't know what to do with them.
How'd you people happen to pop in?
Yeah.
Yes. I might not have been shot.
I'll be all right. Don't let's fuss till the doctor comes.
We were looking for this bird.
Well, you've got to go easy. We haven't had any trouble in town for eight years, and we're not going to have any now.
That's so.
Is that so?
Well, when are you quitting?
Quitting? I'm not thinking about quitting.
Now get this, Conroy. My name is Smith. Always was Smith - and always gonna be Smith.
Mr. Schuyler .
Maude, I must speak to you.
But they have.
What did he say?
Why me? What about Jay?
They've got Jean-Louis!
That sounds like their problem.
Now please, Reggie -- cut it out.
I think I love you, Alex --
The phone's ringing --
Whoever it is won't give up -- and neither will I.
Can you give me one good reason why I should?
But you don't agree?
Not at all, huh?!... Let's go to the hotel. And if you're lucky tomorrow Dad will give you another wad of sweaty money.
Let's go get a drink. Unless you're scared to talk about it.
Not yet.
Sorry.
Why be sorry? That's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.
I didn't mean it.
Sure you did. So come on. Say what you think.
Best case scenario, you're back on the payroll for awhile.
Why would you be here?
You're catching on.
Aha! -- The Baron. What do you want here?
What do you like?
Then I defy you, stars! JULIET! JULIET! I will hence tonight.
You know how to use one a these?
Hey. You learn from doing.
Takes the TV, the VCR, some other shit and leaves his wallet on the floor.
So you've done this before, huh?
Well, yes, I would if, uh, if it would mean anything to you. I don't know why it would.
What do you see?
You have.
Yes you do, Jerry. Quite well.
Why not?
No, I, uh, left a dog here this morning. He needed some work on his mouth.
What?!
That's great. Good for you.
No.
The oriental in black. He's an assasin. Now, at the beginning he was hired to kill this guy the cops had. So he got himself arrested. They take him into the police station. And he starts kickin' all the cops' asses. Now, while keepin' them at bay, he finds the guy he was supposed to kill. Does a number on him. Kicks the cops' asses some more. Kicks the bars out of the window. And jumps out into a getaway car that was waiting for him.
Oh, couldn't you say something? You have to slither around behind my back!
So you met somebody else?
Your what?
Well, at least it hasn't been boring.
What can I say?
Hey...
Uh-huh...
Well, considering everything's horrible and tomorrow I have to face my parents... Don't ask me ... I'm sick of my own complaints ... got to get me a new set of thoughts.
That man is your father?!?
Good night.
I haven't either, but I've heard about them. You must realize it was only on the strength of your Paris report that I sent them to Constantinople; without that I never would have trusted them on a mission as important as the fur deal.
As soon as our representatives go to a foreign country they seem to lose all sense of balance. If I told you what's going on in Constantinople right now you wouldn't believe it. Those three have been sitting there for six weeks and haven't sold a piece of fur. This anonymous report was sent me. They are dragging the good name of our country through every caf and night club. Here... "How can the Bolshevik cause gain respect among the Moslems if your three representatives, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski, get so drunk that they throw a carpet out of their hotel window and complain to the management that it didn't fly?"
It gives details which couldn't be invented. Naturally I want to verify it and that's why I need you.
That is for me to decide, Comrade Yakushova.
Yodeling?
Where's that?
Boy! It sure has been a wonderful day. And you - you are beautiful.
Shall I drop by tomorrow? Oh, I have a luncheon date. With this girl.
I've never met her. My mother set it up.
Just don't physically... Fantastic tip -- fantastic.
No, it's no cure. It's something much more interesting.
Cure!? Ha-ha-ha!
You bastard! God! I should've known. You wanted the cure all for yourself!
Go ahead Serafine. Blow him away.
Another step and he's dead!
So...I guess I'll see you around.
Few days ago.
You're going to listen to me.
I was trying to save you. They were going to vaporize you.
Talked him out of it. He thinks we're going to stay a week. I'll have to think of something before morning.
I'm glad you think so. If you ask me, it's foolish. I told you there's no sense in our staying here tonight. We could make New York in less than three hours.
It's the worst job since keymaster.
Pretend I'm somebody else.
What difference does it make where she comes from?
I strongly suspect that Ugarte left the letters of transit with Mr. Blaine. I would suggest you search the cafe immediately and thoroughly.
Hello, Mr. Connell.
Hiyah, John. John, I want to have a little talk with you. What's the matter are you falling? Come here.
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.
A bird! A bird in a gilded cage! Get that thing out of here!
Yes sir!
What would that be, sir?
What an act of benevolence--a service to the community. So that's it. Now there's nothing between you and ignition.
He'll be here. Just keep your cool, kid.
You wish.
The Mission Director.
There she is!
Yes. They're free.
Uh... you... you can pick out up to ten movies...
I always seen ya had the best, but did ya ever think of puttin' in a good word for me with this scumbag!
Eddie?
Because the second lantern, the one on the mast. Was never found. So we have to ask...
Do you still ride?
Not testing. Using. Nukes are passe. This is the weapon of the future.
Because seventeen-year-olds do not like writers from the '30's. They don't even like people in their 30's.
Thanks.
Just take it, OK.
Ten dollars. I'll find a way to pay you back. How would you like to know About somewhere special? The perfect beach. Paradise. No one else knows about it. That's got to be worth something. What do you say?
You. You're the guy that lent me the money.
Yeah, that's right. Now could you be quiet so I can get some sleep.
But I've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, I've got some great prospects I've developed. I want to talk to you about them next week.
Don't rub it in.
Is what you said about the ring but another dream?
I can't have been under much more than a minute.
Whilst you were sleeping, I fetched your ring.
Major Bell here, sir. We have to tell these people that we're friendly. That this whole thing was a mistake. Is anyone trying to contact the ship?
We're going... Damn! We'll tell the press that there was an accident. Chemical warfare spill. That cover cannot be violated in any way. Understand me, Shermin?
Neither did I.
Get the body out of there. Load it on the Air Force chopper and get it to Wright Patterson. They'll take it from there... We didn't expect this, Shermin.
None. And there's another one in the area that's alive. I don't know if it's the only one. I don't know if it was left here by accident or it's part of an inva...
Is there any possibility that it's a hoax? Could you be mistaken?
I saw it with my own eyes. We've killed an extraterrestrial and...
There's no mistake? You're absolutely sure?
It's real, George.
Get Fox.
How the hell did you get here.
Not bad, Jerome.
How are you, Jerome?
Exactly.
Don't go.
Yeah. Well...I think it is important for you too. Sit down.
Share...
You mean the press conference? I have a couple of ideas I wanted to share with the country.
What do you think you're doing?!
I'm... not... nobody...
You're nothing. Do you understand me! You're NOBODY...
Please. We don't need to talk about Drew.
Thank you.
I love your smell.
-- Could you?
Uh, no. I was gonna take a look now.
She gonna be long?
What does she do?
This is nice.
Her old man was Doc Mitchell. You know, the doc that saved my mother's life and wouldn't take any money for it? You remember that? Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.
Sure. Hey, but the biggest thing I didn't tell you . . .
One more item--not on the check list.
A little birdie told me. Good day, Miss Daniels. Madam.
We met in court.
That's true. I'll rephrase it. I saw you in court.
I'm not sure. I think I figured something out. It must've been in my newsletter.
So I'm a little jumpy. Who wouldn't be?
You wouldn't be sitting here if you didn't halfway believe me.
Yes. Isn't she beautiful?
There's nothing crazy about that, is there?
Miss Mollie Malloy. She's a wonderful person.
A gun? Why -- to shoot, of course.
Sure. You see, I'd never had a gun in my hand before and I didn't know what to do with it. Well, when I get stuck, I know that there's an answer for everything in production for use. So it came to me in a flash: what's a gun for? To shoot! So I shot. Simple isn't it?
It's hard to be around someone who gives so much and-and needs so little in return!
Leave me alone, can you?!
Well, maybe I've asked advice once or twice or-or made a joke.
Charged?
Good for you.
Well, for the past couple of years I've been goin' out with girls from my acting class.
What's so fuckin' good about it? Actresses are the most fucked-in-the-head bunch of women in the world. It's like they gotta pass a test of emotional instability before they can get their SAG card. Oh, guess what? I had a really good reading for "T.J. Hooker" the other day.
... formica. I did real well. I think she liked me.
You don't meet him in the audition. That comes later. Hope, hope.
Did you meet Captain Kirk?
You can't have just one.
Do you have the...
You're not a big talker, are you?
Had to work it out for myself, though, didn't I?
Just the obvious stuff.
My insurance does not cover PMS
What was that?
It looks like you bit it--it'll be all right.
I'm not sure I dialed right -- Jane?
No.
No, you are. I know exactly what you mean. It's not that you're missing something. It's that the other person gives something to you... that you had all the time. You just didn't see it until they came along.
This is New York City, it s like the needy people capital of the world. Those Jersey clients of yours aren t a tenth as pathetic as the ones you could get here...
Who are you?
That was something I was never able to find out, sir.
Twenty! What did he do with them?
Well, sir, he sometimes had as many as twenty in the house at the same time.
I'm Clay Phillips. My brother Steve.
It was sort of sweet actually -- I mean, I know she's an actress and all that, so she can deliver a line -- but she said that she might be as famous as can be -- but also... that she was just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her.
Okay. I promise.
You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
How, did you know about my grandfather?
Of course, I'll be careful.
I love you very much, my dear.
I know how it is to be lonely. Is there anything you wish to tell me?
-- You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. Goodnight, dear.
Everybody's a doctor around here. This apartment house is all green pajamas and slippers. The guy I'm waiting for to vacate is a doctor. What kind of doctor?
Yes, I think that one may be.
...Thanks.
The what?
Probably lookin' for sparrin' partners.
But first, you have to start with the clothes!
I don't know.
All right.
Wow, Josie- you look really-
Would an exclusive story like that be worth a thousand bucks to you?
Your attention, please. May I be the first to say, It's a raid!
Well, I got it, Joe.
No, no.
I'd put you there myself.
Then you can learn to act normally. I had to!
I doubt that. Besides, I can't help myself. I'm just a figment of your imagination.
You have humiliated me in public for the last time.
Sorry. The women here aren't my type. Most of them aren't even my species.
You are too! Mooning over Julie when we could both be gettin' some o' this fine local action. It's not like she's gonna know. Out of town, under five minutes, and in a coma don't count.
I am not. And I don't gotta.
Aw, come on. You know you love me. You're a masochistic pain freak. You gotta love me.
He jests at scars that never felt a wound. But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks? It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, Who is already sick and pale with grief, That thou her maid art far more fair than she: Be not her maid, since she is envious; Her vestal livery is but sick and green And none but fools do wear it; oh cast it off. It is my lady, O, it is my love! O, that she knew she were!
You sure?
Which?
I'm not going back there. I don't even know who you're talking about.
'Cause I'm a guy, I have pride.
Kitchen and lower house.
Back and upper corridors.
Buenas noches, Senora Cruz. Enrique walks in the opposite direction--
They stopped training infantry there in the late '50s. It was just a playground for the jackrabbits till they gave it to the county last year.
Es muy lindo, su coche--
I did. I walked out the door. I felt like I was a scared little kid. I thought you knew that about me. I ran back to the bonfire, trying to outrun my humiliation. You said, "so go" with such disdain.
Well, there's a pirate In truth, I have not written a word.
Good title.
Romeo and Ethel the Pirate's Daughter. Yes, I know.
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.
I love your early work. "Was this the face that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of Ilium?"
Maybe you can.
How can you be here...
No!
Yes.
Yes.
That's my mum's.
No!
I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones.
There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.
Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work?
That's what I'm saying.
And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?
Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work.
Just get me some horses.
Madmartigan! I can't stand being in closed-in places.
Good...I'm tired.
Ok.
Yeah?
Um. You're doing all right.
Just shows you how wrong a guy can be. Doughnut?
No. No. It's too good a story.
One consolation; you can never be lonesome.
Just one... why me?
Then find another way.
Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
Where have I heard this song before?
What mission?
I can't.
What is... ...Coke?
You know, tomorrow's a very big day for me... It would be nice if you acted like you understood.
Oh, but Doctor. Isn't this wonderful. To live -- to live -- in the Grand Hotel.
You okay, Rose?
That's an answer.
Oh yeah. There was, uh, somebody on the plane worked in a recording studio, and, uh, we got this telephone call, this guy is making a sound effects record, and he'd gotten our address and he wanted to know if he could come over and record her scream.
So anyway, these two federal marshals meet the plane, and they take our address, and they ask us never to fly with 'Friendly Skies' again.
Oh.
So anyway, they closed the doors, and she starts to scream. I've never in my life heard anyone scream quite like that.
Suppose that Lednov was to have found you, instead of me. Why you wouldn't have had a chance.
I'm sorry I asked.
No, I'm going to answer you. You want an answer? I'll give it to you. Loyalty. She was loyal. Everything grew from there.
Does that work?
Yeah...Seems to.
No, I wouldn't go in one of those places with a gas mask on.
I know what you mean! I usually wear a big hat and dark glasses.
How do you do?
Hi, Eve!
Fallout shelter. There's a difference.
Yes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting.
A few indiscretions in his youth.
I understand he practices the very crimes he preaches in his fiction.
I hope you'll judge him by his progress here, and not his past reputation.
Indiscretions, Abbe? Please. I've read his case history. At sixteen, he violated a serving girl with a crucifix. After six months in the dungeon at Vincennes, he mutilated a prostitute, cutting her flesh with a razor, then cauterizing the wounds with wax --
Playing dress-up with cretins? That sounds like a symptom of madness; not its cure.
He's made a great success of our Little Theater; there's seldom an empty seat. Not to mention its therapeutic value.
You will never behave like that again! Do you understand?
'I like him'? Diane, I'm talking about being honest with people, being decent...
Listen, you like beer?
Then dance the next number with Kringelein.
I feel sorry for him.
I fell in love last night -- the real thing.
I thought that, too -- but I found that it does. Come along, dance with Kringelein.
Miss Flaemm.
Looks like tonight.
Slow down, kid.
Well, I'm off. A reporter's work is never done. Mrs. Pressman, thank you.
Tell me. When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet?
Trust me on it.
They have, sugar.
It's a comfortin' idea.
We'll be alright, peanut, long as we've got room to move.
Alright. You can see her. But she can't see you.
Please, have a seat.
Hmmmm . . .
Hmmmm . . .
Not if you be chaste. Tis an awesome test of virginity.
Well, that'll be the first time.
You don' know nothin' 'bout it, baby. Nothin'! And don't kid yourself - you did your bit.
Well, just what the hell do you expect me to do?
Why are there no photographs in these frames?
I'll never forget you, Maude. But I would like a photo of you.
Why?
No! That's not fair. That's not it at all. Look, something somewhere got screwed up. Maybe some metaphysical wires got crossed. I may not have the right name, but I was there. I'm the guy. I'm-- skywriting??
I know you do. Good luck to you, too.
Findley.
I am riding to Dublin myself, and if your ladyship will allow me the honor of riding with you, I shall do my best to protect you from further mishap.
O'Higgins... Mohawk O'Higgins.
As you have been robbed of your purse, may I have permission to lend your ladyship a couple of pieces to pay any expenses which you might incur before reaching your home?
How different was her lively rattle to the vulgar wenches at Kilwangan assemblies. In every sentence, she mentioned a lord or a person of quality. To the lady's question about my birth and parentage, I replied that I was a young gentleman of large fortune, that I was going to Dublin for my studies, and that my mother allowed me five hundred per annum.
Loretta. What's that smell?
The man understood me. The woman wanted to be cheap, but the man saw that I was right.
I brought you something.
They are little stars and birds. Birds fly to the stars, I guess.
Have a nice trip.
Give me some bourbon. J. T. S. Brown.
Have a nice trip?
No.
Midge!
I'm not telling you what I think! I'm telling you what he thinks!
Carlotta?
Will we always leave it at this?
Look, I came down here to face everybody. I didn't want to slink away like some coward...
This is her family and her fault.
Well. How come she didn't...
I don't blame him.
Yeah.
Nine AM! But that's - twelve hours.
Mr. Hypnos, you run this place. I'm begging you. There's gotta be something I can do.
Stu, I like you personally, I admire your work, but I'm just the God of Sleep. This is Death's bailiwick.
Maybe you could talk to Death!
Me? Me, go crawling to Death? My friend, it will be a cold, cold day in Las Vegas, Nevada, before I go crawling to that piece of -
Now Death is not what you would call a people person, like me. Death is a putz - and I should know. I'm his little brother.
You're Death's brother?
You keep an eye on it.
Here's fifty bucks -- You an' the girl have a nice time.
Oh, so you're in the big shit now! Child abuse. People go to prison for what you just did to me.
What's that?
I need him to help avenge my father, murdered these twenty years.
I mean if you knew it were stolen.
He'll be back. What would you do if anybody gave you a bracelet?
Sure! Excuse me.
Congratulations.
Explain it... I told you.
Well, like kill him with the atomic bomb?
Like an accident where maybe Lula might also get hurt?
Simple? Kill him? How?
You need to explain it.
We head north, begin the grape tour up there, make our way south so the more we drink the closer we get to the motel.
She probably went home, lit some candles, put on some relaxing music, took a nice hot bath, and laid down on her bed with her favorite vibrator.
Shut up.
Oooh. Oh. Miles. Miles.
Have you no shame?
Fuck you.
So what're we going to have? Pigs in a blanket? The "rancher's special breakfast"? Or maybe just some grease and fat with a side of lard?
Listen, forget the shoes. I'll just take a cab... Uh...
Parry.
Parry... I'm Jack.
I know...
I wish you all the luck in the world. When you get the Grail, I'm sure I'll be seeing lots of you on various talk shows...
But I can't get it... He's...
See, you don't know him... That's why you're the one... You can get it...
Thanks... You can keep the doll.
Thanks a mill -- And I'll give you a buzz as soon as I hear from the people upstairs and we'll get this thing off the ground... Thanks for stopping by, Jack. Give my love to the wife and kids.
Buddy's got a thing against ya, Rock. Some people just hate for no reason, y'know.
...and... uh, yeah, uh... uh, you know, I-I-I...
Well, who's Sadie?
Duane?
Yeah, it's a great story, though, I mean, I... I... it really made my day. Hey, I think I should get outta here, you know, 'cause I think I'm imposing, you know...
Uh, narcolepsy.
Buddy's in a bad mood -- prostate problems.
Now come on, you're be--, 'cause you're being angry at me.
We're playing for a goddamn gymnasium!
Still--
Yes, I saw it.
Of course, it was mighty writing. There is no one like Marlowe
Master Henslowe, you have your actors.
I saw his Tamburlaine, you know. Wonderful.
You admire it?
Better fortune, boy.
Connecticut. I told the office I'd work out of there next week. When are you planning to start back?
This is not going well.
My father.
Yeah. He lives here, right?
Fine. I'm pretty much moved in.
I'm not sailing with this thing on board!
This shit is bad luck! Don't you understand? You treat it like a game - two men have already died!
Oh Jesus ... you took it.
Ann ... you're father is dead. You have nothing to prove anymore.
Not that I don't think you'd be good at it, but--you know--I wouldn't be disappointed if you decided to do something else with your life.
My God! The Bumstead contracts!!
Oh my God, sir!
But --
Get out of my sight.
You nitwit! I worked for three years on this deal!
Me? No, no, no, 'cause I never shower in a public place.
I have it.
No. I have the ring. Was I supposed to have a pre-nup?
No. You have the ring. Wrigley has the pre-nup.
Oh. I thought maybe -- Gee!
... Listen, so much has happened and I think it would be a good thing for both of us if we slowed things down a little.
So, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love? That what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him. That if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.
So, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. That must cause tremendous anxiety. Sleepless nights. Incredible stress.
Didn't Mr. Marsh also tell you that Miss Lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to Chicago for awhile?
Could you repeat the last part of what Mr. Marsh said to you the day before his death?
Well, think about it. Isn't it possible?
Don't do it.
Sweetheart, you're drunk.
C'mon, cunt, you're going for a walk.
You're going.
I am very sorry, ma'am. Goodbye now.
Should we say a little prayer first?
I, I don't mean to sound insensitive. I understand your situation. But there's nothing I can do. You just called the wrong person, that's all. I hear there are a bunch of therapists in New York. Maybe you should call one of them.
Ma'am, first class to Montana is a waste of good money. Now, am I being too polite here or when I say NO in Utah, does that mean YES in New York City?
You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
Sure.
In the generator room again?
Fine. Corkscrew's on the right.
He did? I play the tuba
What did he play?
Sure!
I'll go down the line, Kayo, believe me.
So help me God!
And I still say you stand up and I'll stand up with you.
Why are you doing this to me, Rod?
There are no gentlemen on the Tribune.
I don't know, it's a mystery.
How long were you with the girl?
Maybe he knows how to drink.
You being cute?
Pool.
So I got talent. So what beat me?
I don't think there's a pool player alive shoots better pool than I saw you shoot the other night at Ames. You got talent.
Character.
I got drunk.
You're damned right I'm sure. Everybody's got talent. I got talent. You think you can play big-money straight pool, or poker, for forty straight hours on nothing but talent? You think they call Minnesota Fats the best in the country just 'cause he's got talent? Nah. Minnesota Fats's got more character in one finger than you got in your whole skinny body.
Yes.
We're both professionals, Oatman.
So you're saying that Ulysses-- everything he said to his queen when he came back--everything was a lie? He just wanted to fuck around?
I think what you fear Martin is domesticity. It's the greatest fear that men have who belong to Western Culture. It's centuries old. Like King Phillip, in the 11th or 12th century who decided one day that he was so bored with his dreary life at home with his wife he thought, "Well, wouldn't it be great if we hit the road and fought... oh... the Saracens." So he put the word out and was amazed when a million men signed up and all of them wanted to go and fight in distant lands and do terrible things to people rather than stay at home with their families.
How am I gonna get past the guards?
Thanks, Kitty, I'll never forget you for th--
...among others.
You know what I'm talking about. Miss Daniel.
He was a research engineer at the Tuscarora Laboratories in Pennsylvania. He disappeared from there last April. I've been hired to look for him.
Well, I've just been able to get off that Norway coast - so far.
Yes...?
It's a bet--come on, Sally!
You know, I really should take your card.
Ahh, that's right, like one big happy family. This is Nick's room and uhh....
Dating, seriously dating. You're thirsty, want something to drink? Sure you do, it's been a long trip.
That's ridiculous, I'm...I'm very, umm, what do you call it?
Committed.
Yes, it does.
He did!
That's good thinking, Baxter. Next month there's going to be a shift in personnel around here -- and as far as I'm concerned, you're executive material.
This?
Oh? Oh!
It also says here -- that you are alert, astute, and quite imaginative --
Swap them? For what?
I'm not just giving those tickets, Baxter -- I want to swap them.
So do I -- I'm going to take four aspirins and get into bed -- so you better give the tickets to somebody else --
Baxter, you're not reading me. I told you I have plans.
Now put down the key -- -- and put down the address.
I am?
Well, I was born Jewish, you know, but, uh, but last winter I tried to become a Catholic and...it didn't work for me. I-I studied and I tried and I gave it everything, but, you know, Catholicism for me was die now, pay later, you know. And I just couldn't get with it. And I, and I wanted to, you know. I--
Extraordinarily lucky.
Hello, goodbye, I want you, I hate you. It s all just words. None of it means anything. What matters is what you do. You either stay put or you walk away. If you look back, you re not walking away!
Oh, Mary . . .
Same as they done in Mexico.
You know who I am?
Darling, you're wonderful.
Oh, God. I'm awake.
You can save that and tell it to the police. They'll be here in a minute.
I just wanna kiss, that's all.
Please...
Please...
What's that? A Democrat with an attitude!
Gee. But --
How long has she had the room?
They're migrants.
Are you saying it's a mistake, that you didn't go to any meetings? They say you did.
Yes. They pick fruit, all kinds. They travel up and down the coast with the seasons. The trick to Mr. Rose is, you have to let him be the boss.
Migrants?
When she comes down, don't say that I've been here.
Does she sleep here? Ever?
So...then the coroner's report is probably wrong. I mean...this is ridiculous. There's been a mistake. I don't believe any of this.
What?
He figures a perfectly good lantern could get banged around up there. So he climbs up. To cut it down.
...On holiday?
Who? Martin... He s Martin...
NO. NO. DON'T YOU SAY THAT.
You are bad. You are a bad person. you are a bad person and you have no right to take people's confidence in your service --
YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. YOU GO FUCK YOURSELF. MY LOVE WAS HURT, SHE GOT HURT. I AM IN LOVE WITH HER AND YOU HURT YOU AND YOU ARE GONNA FUCKING GET HURT. YOU DON'T TOUCH HER, I LOVE HER.
I haven't even told you what's happened. Your girl that you have that works there for you threatened me and two men just chased me -- extorted money -- DEAN Go fuck yourself that shit doesn't have anything to do with me - this is a legitimate bossiness.
What?
Stop squawking! You were doing this job on a ship four years ago when I first picked you up, weren't you?
Have you any idea what these things cost over here?
Please go on, Mr. Bartholomew -- what happened then?
That's when he fell.
Scobie was able to travel, but Carson Dyle was clearly dying, so they --
We talked. He wanted to get a bite -- after. I said no.
A dollar forty.
I'll need it--gave my last buck to the bedroom steward.
The dead can wait.
I don't believe it. He's clean!
Well, if the blood got onto the gaff by crushing a man's skull...
You don't.
With no bone or scalp or hair present. Would it be more probable that the blood came from crushing a man's skull...
I know. Listen, we need to take a time out here. Can we talk seriously for a minute?
Betty.
Okay.
How?
Why not mine the damned walls?
Tells you something 'bout him what lives there...
We'll need more siege machinery and longer scaling ladders.
Pray they don't turn out to be nightmares.
No...
You're not a dumb fuck, are you, Del?
Of what?
Could you give us an example?
I don't follow...
It's a small town, man. I never should have left Omaha. People here think small. They act small. They're a bunch of dumb fucks.
What do you mean?
You better believe it.
Really?
What's your name?
Nothing. Prices are a little steep here, aren't they?
Can't we go into this later, sweetheart?
Mickey Spillane.
Yes, sweetheart, shh.
He never stopped.
Marylin Rexroth. She came into my office and signed a pre-nup with Howard Doyle.
What?
Yes. The inability to experience pleasure.
What?
Oh. That. Don't waste time with your queen.
He's the wrong man.
Sure, it's only worth 25 million or so, don't bother telling me what you're going to do with it.
You've got everything planned.
Hmmm...44 long.
Christ, what is going on in there?
He's cooking guinea fowl?
But your honor
Oh, I don't know.
I'd rather have Mandrake Falls.
I haven't met anybody here that I like, particularly. They all seem to have the St. Vitus Dance. Except you, of course. People here are funny. They work so hard at living - they forget how to live Last night, after I left you, I was walking along and looking at the tall buildings and I got to thinking about what Thoreau said. They created a lot of grand palaces here - but they forgot to create the noblemen to put in them.
I'm telling you, the minute Brenda sent the fax -- I'm talking the second she pressed that send button -- PG E claims department is on the phone to me, scheduling a meeting.
It sure as hell sounded like they were sitting up and taking notice.
I feel like driving. Are you terrible hungry?
To complete my cure.
Madeleine died here.
Hello. Heard about that graduation present. Really quite a car. Look, I know you're busy, you don't' have to retain me, but you can trust me. I'll tell you a couple of things about myself, I'm nineteen, been overseas for a couple of semesters, but now I'm back. I'm an athlete, so I rarely drink. Kickboxing. You heard of kickboxing, sport of the future? Don 'The Dragon' Wilson, Lenny merciless, one of the champions of the sport? I can see by your face, no. My point is, you can relax because your daughter will be safe with me for the next seven to eight hours.
Yeah.
Hi. Lloyd Dobler, sir. Pleasure to meet you.
Maybe.
Whoa.
How are you?
Hello.
All right, son.
I don't know...
Then screw you. I'll rot.
I'm leaning toward no.
That's your option. Ours could be to keep you locked up for a very long time. In case you didn't know it, you're crazy.
I'll do it. On one condition. I want to make sure she's okay.
We got someone watching her 24 hours a day. She --
That's not what I mean. I want to see her.
Of course I was. I mean, just now I could have made up some story, but I didn't. I told you the truth.
Well, it's a nice surprise. Should I hit the "stop" button?
Maya.
You'll get it. Now what's the story? I'll have the paper send the money right down to you. I swear it on my mother's grave.
I meant on my grandmother's grave. Don't be so technical, Hildy. What's the story?!
No kidding, Hildy. Say, this isn't a rib?
That's great work, Hildy... Huh? Oh, will you stop worrying about the money? I'll see you get it in fifteen minutes.
Hold on a minute.
Lois, help! I can't -- I can't swim -- !
Yes.
How long's this been going on, Muddy?
You're lying. How can you... with your own daughter!
Ain't nobody havin' sex with my little girl, Homer--that's somethin' a father knows.
Go on, cut my clothes. I've got other clothes.
Homer, don't you know what business you in? You don't wanna go into no business with me, Homer--ain't that right?
But she's your daughter ...
And I love her! There ain't nobody else gonna treat her as good as I do! I wouldn't do nothin' to hurt her, Homer--you must know that.
You want a beer, Ang'?
He's an actor, so it can't be good.
Hey, Ang'...
Hiya, Ralph...
I don't know, Clarence, "Doctor Zhivago" is a pretty big movie.
This is for me.
You get Hardy.
I've done this. I've had to do this.
What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
So your husband said he's think it over. Encouraged Mr. Miyamoto to believe he might sell to h...
If you had wanted to, you'd have gone home.
That's right. I told you we had a fight -- that's what it was about -- Miss Olsen -- you know that other girl you saw --
Really?...
Well -- we work in the same building -- and we try to keep it quiet --
Don't you remember? We were at the office party together --
Do you know who this is? Look at him.
Mister -- Miss -- such politeness!
Hello, Miss Kubelik.
You wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar.
Then forget it.
Hell of a way to treat a business partner, that's all I can say.
Don't you think you're overreacting just a little here? We're talking about love, okay? Let's be rational.
What do you think?
Well, don't you?
Now, Mimi, there are a thousand detectives in New York. Hire one of them.
Yes, Maxine, yes.
Yes. I'm crazy. You have driven me crazy. No one in their right mind would go to this much trouble to win over someone as insane as you. Did it ever, even for one second, occur to you how much work it was to set all this up? How many arrangements had to be made? How many players had to be coordinated?
Hope you like it. Feel free to stop reading at any time. I'll take no offense.
Oh,--I was having so much fun I almost forgot--
Oh, hey, change of plans. Steph's off today, so she and I are going on a hike.
Goddamn, Miles, she is nasty. Nasty nasty nasty.
OKAY, GOING UP. ICE, GO HIGH.
LOOK OUT!
Hm?
Well, here we are again.
Oh, an imaginary one. I used to hike a lot through the woods and I'd always take this girl with me so I could talk to her. I'd show her my pet trees and things. Sounds kind of silly but we had a lot of fun doing it.
Sure.
My keys.
Okay, Pat, take it easy -- don't do anything stupid.
What would you call it?
Because I want to get married.
I don't swim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 15.
I don't mind telling you I'd rather have you working with us than against us.
Do you wanna make things easier on me? Now tell me where you were because this is, this is bullshit. You can say anything to me, I hope you still know that.
No - give you another guess.
So, it's obvious, huh?
I stole them when I was interviewing Babykins about Bobo.
Sure, I'll take a chance.
Yeah, I know it's small.
You've always called before, always. Now I'm not asking what you did, I just want to know that you're alright.
Yeah, bu-bu-but why?
Yeah, but you-you got a nice apartment.
Don't you think I do?
Whatta you mean? You're not gonna give up your own apartment, are you?
I've seen 'em used on TV.
She told me.
I'm looking for a man. Tom Grunemann. Bree thinks he may have been the dumper -- that call she had two years ago. She says you sent her on it.
They tell me you use narcotics. Could I bring someone around to look at your arms?
Why didn't you tell Bree, afterwards?
Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
I am here representing Mr. Dumbarton, on a... matter of some delicacy.
Oh. I guess they just can't help it.
Who?
Women. You know, I can't help feeling rather sorry for Scobie. Wouldn't it be nice if we were like that?
What -- like Scobie?
Because I really suspect Gideon -- and it is always the person you don't suspect.
Do women think it's feminine to be so illogical -- or can't they help it?
You survived and now you shall continue the curse.
A It's always the person you don't suspect; B that means you think it's Tex because you really suspect Gideon; therefore C if you think it's Tex, it has to be someone else -- Gideon.
It's you, David.
What?!
The wolf's bloodline must be severed. The last remaining werewolf must be destroyed.
Will you be quiet?!
No -- Gene Kelly. Remember the way he danced down there next to the river in 'American in Paris' -- without a care in the world? This is good, want some?
What's wrong with you? Shut up!
On the moors, we were attacked by a lycanthrope, a werewolf.
Shut up, you zombie!
One guess.
I don't know. It's not like it was a well thought-out plan.
Oh God.
You'll be next.
What exactly is wrong?
Of course.
Daddy'll do fine. Besides, he's got Joe. And so do you.
No, not okay. I thought we had a good thing going here. It shows you never know.
That may be. But I don't like the fucker. I don't like the way he looks at you and talks to you. And vice versa.
Sure.
What's a 'good' tired. Tired is tired.
Before that. Your face is very familiar.
Half.
In Louisville it was seventy-five per cent.
Eddie?... YOU OWE ME MONEY!
And just how do you figure that, Bert? What do you figure I owe you?
...What? What did you call me? George... McCord. You're my favorite actor on...
I quit, Eddie. I can't beat you. Willie, give him the stakes. You got yourself a pool player.
But I'm David... I mean, I'm not David, but she thinks I am! You heard her... Stop staring at me... I'm not crazy, she is!
Well, here it's half.
What if I don't pay ya, Bert?
Is it here? Now? In this room?
Born and bred.
Leeloo... is... she's...
We do not take tips. I'll apply this to the cost of the dress.
We are not a saloon act. We do not take tips from dirty old men.
Who?
We trust you, Lloyd. You know that.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Good evening, Captain.
Thank you. It is a pleasure to have you here, Major.
Champagne and a tin of caviar.
May I recommend Veuve Cliquot '26, a good French wine.
He was killed last night. By birds.
I got here as fast as I could. Where's Cathy?
This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
That's all right, Deb. Go be happy and smile a lot, Deb. Do it for me.
Aw come on, Alex!
Some other time.
It was... it was like the emotional part outweighed the physical part.
Mock, mock, mock.
It was... Fantastic.
I know. That's the amazing part of it. I mean, it wasn't like Cirque du Soleil acrobatics, just standard missionary stuff, but it was... ah forget it. I'm going to sound like a Hallmark card.
How you doin', boy?
Another time.
I'm putting you on the coin... Your essence... That way you'll always be with me when I dive.
No! I told you! You won a contest!
For one thing, you like expensive things.
You re a little tougher, Peter.
Yes. Later.
Well, anything you do is likely to be fatal, so you know -
Very true!
Well, he worked around.
Oh -- I haven't flown for a long time.
Like a woman of mystery.
No, I'm not.
But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
My father was slaughtered by a sixfingered man. He was a great swordmaker, my father. And when the six-fingered man appeared and requested a special sword, my father took the job. He slaved a year before he was done.
If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
And where can I go?
That wasn't an offer. A million would've been an offer. When they send the God damn mail clerk down to jerk me off, waste my time, it's a fuck you.
Because they can. You heard that kid -- they have 28 billion dollars at their disposal. They can afford to waste all the time in the world.
Really? For most people it's a rather pleasant experience. What exactly did you...
Thanks. I'll keep it in mind.
It's chemistry, Andy. Nothing more. Mutated antigens concentrated in the heart of the infector unlock a vaccine- like chain reaction in the infectee. There were not many bio-chemists working in the twelfth century, but with today's technology it's possible to synthesize any chemical imaginable. When I discovered this ancient cure I knew who to go to.
Yes. I was able to decode the old texts and give Terrence the specifications. It took a lot of trial and error, but finally he got it: Adenine Di-Methyloxide. ADM. I call it ADAM. But just before he was attacked, he hid it...
Uncle Terrence.
Yes, that sociopath. He's given himself over to the evil of lycanthropy. To him, ADAM is just a threat to the terror he holds over others. To us, it's salvation.
Because Gaston was after it.
Yeah, I know. Back to the Eiffel Tower. And what about you?
Yeah, well I don't know much about chemistry, but even if this stuff works, you better find it by midnight. Otherwise it's -
Well, I certainly hope you find him, someday.
More pursuit than study lately. You see, I cannot find him. It's been twenty years now. I am starting to lose confidence. I just work for Vizzini to pay the bills. There's not a lot of money in revenge.
What's a scam?
I hear ya. Play.
Someone down here?
With time...you get used to it. Besides, when you hear from up here that there's a full house and that people are laughing, having fun... Then you're happy too. So I've been wasting my breath? You pretend to agree with me, but as soon as my back is turned, you do what you want! Get out of here! I don't want to lay eyes on you again! This is the last straw! Your mother's right, you're crazy!! But how'd he do it? The little bastard! By watching, he's learned! It's incredible! I'm letting the box office know you're not to set foot even into the theatre! There are no more tickets for you! And I'm also talking to Father Adelfio! You won't be an altar boy any more either!!! You little runt!
I didn't lie.
Oh, uh, I meant to tell you... Alex brought that fabric over...
The funeral's on Friday.
"... FRESH, WIND IN HER HAIR... LIFE WITHOUT CARE... SHE'S BROKE... BUT IT'S 'OK'...
Hi.
I have to go to New York tomorrow.
No. I'm learning the banjo. Do you?
Yeah, I'm all right.
I could be mentoring Kramer. Kramer clerked for Scalia.
Sometimes I have serious doubts about you.
What the fuck...?
Wrigley!
Didn't I? That's funny. Isn't it funny?
For a while. She left.
It shouldn't last. Gives me time to take a go-go juice break.
I suppose.
It's been a long time, Ma.
We'll be waiting. Over.
Your limo's ready, Ma.
Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
I found this at your brother s.
We'll be there. Listen, if he's really caving in, we'll go from there down to the office. I want him to commit his stock to us this morning.
What are you saying, that it's time to go?
You're gonna hit some heavy precipitation in about six minutes. Better let your flaps down, these roads are killers when they're damp.
Good to see you, Ma.
Make your teeth yella --
I know better than you do. Love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.
Let us give each other complete happiness, and let us be sure that as many times as we satisfy our desires, they will each time be born anew.
Sir William Cosgrove is a man who is dying, and yet I envy him more than any man in Christendom. He enjoys a privilege of which I am deprived. He may take you in his arms whenever he pleases, and no veil keeps his senses, his eyes, his soul from enjoying your beauty.
O, my dearest love. Enough! I beg you. Stop believing in your experience. You have never known love. My very soul is leaving me! Catch it on your lips, and give me yours!
We're locked on MiG ONE. Why doesn't he disengage?
These guys are getting on my nerves.
I'M UP HERE TOO, MAVERICK.
ROGER, COUGAR. Okay boys, pull out with your hands up and nobody'll get hurt.
Lordy! Eyeball to Asshole. Hope nobody burps!
I'LL LOCK ON THEM, COUGAR. Gotcha covered, don't nobody move.
That's missile lock!
-- Sure.
I am marry to the cousin of a friend-- but only to be able to live here. This is the mother of my child--
Tell me about yourself.
We have a daughter.
No! I was pissing!
Huh. That sounds great. Unless someone else comes out with Six-Minute Abs.
He was heavy, but we were real careful. But I don't remember him hitting anything, anywhere.
Are you the Miracle Max who worked for the King all those years?
I just hope it's enough to buy a miracle, that's all. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 91.
I have a little.
Wait a minute--I think I can cut something else out. "Back in four weeks." Instead of "in four weeks"--say "next month"--That saves another word.
That's right. I owe you a dollar sixty.
Just a minute--I don't think we need the word "Back" --Where is "Back"?
Wait a minute--I think I can cut out a couple o' more words.
"Will--be--back--in--four--weeks." You don't need the "will be." Just say "Back in four weeks."
That's right.
I can always chop cotton if I have to. If you want a ride, I'll take you home.
Okay.
That's the problem. We need results. The press is driving us crazy over this P2P thing. Calling us the 'speed capitol of the country'. You know the sort of thing. It's getting political. The Commissioner's getting very uneasy.
You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
Okay. So is that a yes or a no?
Take it easy.
Yes, I am. Thanks. I mean it.
You want to come?
Then you should stay here.
Bandit two, I gotta make a quick pit stop.
Now what?
We're outta motion lotion.
I'll keep streaking. Pick me up.
Do you think you can get back at your Dad that way? I mean sometimes if we can't get as close to somebody as we'd like we have to try making them jealous--so they'll have to pay attention. Did you ever think of that?
I don't want to... I swear...
You know I'm always happy to see you, Jeanne, but to keep coming here twice, three times a day...
You don't shoot squirrels.
Meaning what?
I said poker's an honest trade. Only suckers buck the tiger. The Odds are all with the house.
Yeah, baby...
No, I love her, we will be a family. I have her piano. I will mend it, she will get better.
Nuisance value?
Oh -- that phone call! I gave them your number -- hope you don't mind.
That was wonderful.
Yes. I'm tired.
To bed.
Good! At last you're making yourself useful. So long!
Tomorrow. See you tomorrow night.
I'll be back in a while.
I've gotta give her some pills. Percodan, she ran out.
And listen, I'll be right back and I want your ass in that bed when I get back.
Wow.
Well --
No, Roy. I'm not gonna cry.
This used to be my specialty. I was good in a living room. Send me in there, I'll do it alone. And now I just... I don't know... but on what was supposed to be the happiest night of my business life, it wasn't complete, wasn't nearly close to being in the same vicinity as complete, because I couldn't share it with you. I couldn't hear your voice, or laugh about it with you. I missed my wife. We live in a cynical world, and we work in a business of tough competitors, so try not to laugh -- I love you. You complete me.
She did. This photo was taken a month ago at the church food drive.
What's going on?
Yes. Where is he?
Come on, fellas.
Let's see... where was I? Oh, yes. He went to find the man. That man was desperate! He knew that he was caught dead to rights -- and with prison staring him in the face, he took the only way out. He killed Wynant. It's terrible to tell you this way but your father's dead, Dorothy.
Have you got it straightened out now?
Oops!
No, sir!
Cameron.
Only two things come out of Oklahoma, steers and queers. Which one are you, boy? I don't see any horns so you must be a queer.
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
Stop whispering, Sweet Pea, you're giving me a hard on!
Let me see what I can do.
I m afraid I have bad news, Mr De Moraes. I have reason to believe your brother s in trouble.
M'sieu Monescu!
What if I answer yes? Will my wish come true?
So, Jack... think you be a Green Man and not know Gump.
Gump, is it?
How old are you, dear? Thirteen?
No. She was an immigrant.
Someone not from Maine.
What was that you said he was?
Right. If you believe in God. As a narcissist, Viznick couldn't blame himself for the alleged murders. He created the voices after the fact. In order to avoid the simple truth that there is no outside force that guides George Viznick and that George Viznick needs to pay.
Absolutely nothing. The Blizzard always came straight with his messages. But wrap your minds around this one.
Look, I know there's no going back for us. That's not it. I just want to make this up to you. Clear my relationship karma. And I know the area, I've got some cousins down there. Please. Let me do this for you. Let this be my gift to you.
It's in the south. I've still got my rental car. I can get you there by morning...
Because-- I want you to be happy.
Just incidentally -- why are you wearing that?
Cecile, all I want to do is give you a kiss.
But I love you. I'll love you forever.
I think we should get out of here. It's going to rain.
What the hell is that?
Peggy! Where're you going? Come back!
How do you do?
Why, thank you! Very nice to have met you, Cliff! May I ask you a question?
... And his friend, Johana...
Madame...
What should we give him?
John Parker, tell them we're doing our best. Stall.
Guess maybe I'm old enough to hold my own in a fight, huh?
How does this strike you? Commissar Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow. Unexpected situation here. Duchess Swana in Paris claims jewels, and has already brought injunction against sale or removal. After long and careful study we suggest in the interest of our beloved country a fifty-fifty settlement as best solution. Iranoff, Buljanoff, and Kopalski.
He's a bad man. Sends people to Siberia!
You wouldn't like Razinin.
We like you, Leon -- don't we like Leon?
We don't like Razinin.
What's the name of that Commissar on the Board of Trade?
Oh, Leon, you are so good.
Razinin, Board of Trade, Moscow.
Razinin.
Annie says her panties will keep one side of my brain occupied while I'm on the mound, thus keeping my brain slightly off center, which is where it should be for artists and pitchers. She also said I should throw whatever pitches you call for.
You like to hang out with murderers or what? Did you know Roxy --
Hotel.
Really? I was looking at some figures from the Sickness and Accident Claims Division -- do you know that the average New Yorker between the ages of twenty and fifty has two and a half colds a year?
Why?
I sort of like it.
Yeah. I better not get too close.
That's me.
Better than I can!
Okay...you smoke Hoyo de Monterreys. You re a scotch man, single malt, not because it s trendy but because you ve been doing it for forty years, and you stay with what works. You have two great loves in your life, your horses and this company. You wept openly the day the Dow hit ten thousand...
Then he gets it out of your share, not mine! Not mine!
Right now, I'm just not sure about... making such definite plans.
What?...
...Sailor Ripley... Can I talk to Lula?
... I'd like to focus on my career - - now than I can, now that everything's all right... Parry's taken care of... and... Like I said, I feel like I know a lot more now and I don't...
I think Mary Agnes could kill someone.
I think he got a little scratch, Mother.
Oh Jesus.
Just three questions. The Miyamoto family bought your seven acres for 4500?
Did he see some danger from defen...
Goddammit, I am sick of this --
We work there!
A couple blocks! About six!
On Clark Street!
He's got one!
So you live in Chicago now?
It'll be very interesting to see how you go about solving this, Inspector--
How could you do this?
Ooh, be still, my heart.
See that down there? That's my most prized possession. My new Porsche.
Ah, Cole. I don't remember ordering an asshole from room service.
I don't want any trouble.
Oh, come on, just a little.
I'm ready to make you another deal.
Great car.
Right here. Now sit down.
Look. I wanna tell you. I forgive you for everything. I know what you've been going through. You're just scared. I was scared, too, but I'm not anymore.
It doesn't have to be this complicated, Erin. There's a lot of jobs out there.
You mind telling me what that's supposed to mean?
Come on, Erin. A job's supposed to pay your bills, not put you in danger.
Look, don't take this the wrong way, but don't you think you might be out of your league here?
Yes.
She was.
I couldn't help myself. You get lost inside a women like her. It was like a drug. It was the best sex I ever had.
I woke up the next morning and she was gone.
Thank you, dad, I got it.
Right.
Good evening. I want to stay at this hotel.
A card?
-- all I want is the number of where she's staying and that should be god damn good enough, now stop treating me this way, please -- Just Give Me The Number Elizabeth Please Now I think I will kill you if you don't.
There is no reason for you to treat me like you do -- you're killing me, you are killing me with the way that you are towards me --
I just want to know where she's staying.
I....please don't do this.
......she forgot her purse at my work and I wanted to get it back to her.
I told you to go on in.
I love you... Let him take you home.
I'll take you... why not?
Here are the keys to my apartment. I'm going to park you in my place while I take Carol home.
Come on, kid. I'll buy you a drink.
I think you gotta camp it here...
Look, I've got to get a hold of Frank and see where I'm hanging my hat 'cause...
Yeah?
I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers.
Was bankrupt and dead before I was twenty.
Not exactly -- but we have a little apartment here that's probably about as popular as yours. You, of course, remember Miss Torso.
Were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the Knoxs mental state asked to re-examine them?
Who is we?
I take it by your answer it was a whole new team?
I already did, it's a totally barbaric custom...but on you, it looks good.
Now you want Arizona dollars.
Good, 'cause see, I am a valuable commodity. I go across the middle. I see the ball and a dude coming right at me, wanting to kill me, I tell my brain "get killed, catch the ball." That's New York Steak, baby. Rare. And yet, nobody's giving me LOVE. Nobody's giving me PROPS. Nobody. I went to Arizona State, I'm from Arizona, I break Arizona records, I'm a Sun Devil, man!!!
If it's on the level.
Big-ass titties?
Guess "please" would be a stretch.
What's that?
I know this. What do you want?
Your legs don't look broke.
Says she can get me in to see this killer.
Sorry. It's just...a strange woman waltzes into my office today. Tells me she murdered her parents and can prove Satan exists.
I guess -- about my future.
No. Of course not. Mmmm. Anago. My favorite.
Different.
Mind your own business, Father.
Okay.
First things first.
Alright, we're just getting started on my list of things you need to know. Take notes if you want to.
You got eyes. I'm right in front of you.
Okay, look. If you really want to apply for a job here, you can do it the way everyone else does. Send in a r sum , make an --
Your gun.
Well, everyone's entitled to their opinion.
Are you deaf as well as stupid?
Now, go into second. Little more gas... Yeah! You can get this whole problem. Now, maybe you downshift to first?
Well, Ben, it was quite a bit to do with me.
Didn't even have to ask.
Wha -- what do you want?
I was just going to tell you that I love you. I said it.
Holy shit, yes!
Why didn't you take all your clothes off? You could have stopped forty cars.
Good. Now forget about the ex-wife and get over to the Adams Hotel.
You! Don't make me laugh.
What're you going to do?
What for?
To the bed.
Hey Mav, this is Sally. She doesn't believe a word I say. Tell her I'm married, will you?
Yeah, he's married--but then again, he,s not dead.
Figured out what?
I... didn't know where you lived.
No.
Oh! Yes! Here!
Yes, I knew which one it was. It's out there, now. But I didn't think you'd want to be brought home that way.
That goes double for me.
Because... because... Listen Edie, don't get sore now but I think we're getting in love with each other.
On the bed!
I'll take you home.
Hey, that was last year.
She'll come back.
Did your people have any contingencies rehearsed?
You have no conception of this, do you?
Good... It looks like we might be the welcoming committee, so I think we should try and figure out what we're gonna do if we have to come face to face with this creature.
They're gonna let some local cop blow him away.
Jesus Lyman, you're an ignorant fool.
The Bailey Building and Loan. It was up there.
Hey . . . hey. Where did the Building and Loan move to?
What?
There is no George Bailey. You have no papers, no cards, no driver's license, no 4-F card, no insurance policy . . .
Hey, Violet! Hey, listen that's Violet Bick!
Don't talk dirty 'bout ya sister.
I know you care about him. I've never seen you like this about anyone, so please don't take it wrong when I tell you that I believe that Tom, while a very nice guy, is the Devil.
I dunno -- she fills gaps.
What's the attraction? I don't see it?
Out!
Oh, sure. Sure. We don't want to fire Arthur.
I'll tell those mugs to keep their shirts on, that you'll be right down.
They incite us to act. In ways we should not... cannot... a lesson the Marquis would do well to learn.
Go back to your room. Quickly.
By whom? The Marquis?
Madeleine, I... there are certain things... feelings... we must not voice.
Don't come back, not tonight, not again --
What do you mean??
You know damn well who I mean. That dusky-hued lady Satan.
Ignore her?
I'll be okay, just get me home.
Satisfied?
I stand corrected. Wyatt. You're An oak.
Come on Holly!
Jeez. He goes on long enough.
We were talking one time, drinking rum. I may've mentioned Adele, how she worked for a magician. Chino got interested. He's like, Yeah? How does he saw the woman in half? He wanted to meet her. Or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.
Are they worth reading?
Yes, I know. My first concern is to locate the lucky man. When I do, it's your job to keep the newspapers away from him.
It's okay with me as long as my weekly stipend keeps coming in.
Hang up.
Hang up.
Sorry, Mac, I can't. Yeah, Mac. Sure, but I ain't the attorney
Gimme.
Paulie's sister.
Well, I held it like an egg.
Hello, Edie.
Baby, you're the best thing that ever happened to me.
Guy hit the shit outta that one, eh?
I don t think so, thank you...
It's one hell of a job. What do you put on your passport? Profession -- Mel Gibson's bottom.
Oh. Well, you're...certainly welcome!
Fallout shelter.
An' he scrambled the son of a bitch. Having fun yet?
Yeah, the DJ's kinda whack, though. So who is this clown?
I've met you before.
Room service speaking.
I can't think of anything to say to her that seems appropriate given I left and never said goodbye to her.
Yeah...
I have always thought about her and missed her.
Why's he always call me "Meat"? I'm the guy driving a Porsche.
Oh, no, no, no. Y'see, Stu, as it happens, that girlfriend of yours figured out the chemical basis of bad dreams. And she just whipped up a big old batch of nightmare juice!
Monkeybone...!?
Nobody wants to be a sidekick, Stu. So one day he comes to us - he's got a proposition. We help him get your body...in return he gives us all the nightmares we want.
You're nuts! I'm a comic strip artist! What's he gonna do - draw really scary cartoons??
I can hardly wait for your wedding.
Except for that.
You've sort of been... y'know, the woman in my life.
And I was thinking this could be our last time. Alone. Together. You know?
Where did you lose it?
Well you should at least try a little bit.
What's so illogical about that?
It's not for me. It's for my dad. I think he needs a new wife.
It's not that late in Seattle.
He doesn't have one now. That's the problem.
And the wedding date. There's the two of us. So, you think... maybe... You have to go down the aisle with somebody you love and who love you back.
Oh? You can't remember? Let me help your memory...
Did you use the sword that you held in your hand?
You held up your sword and flourished it about in the air? Like this?
... so you were in the middle of the battlefield, with your sword in your hand, waving it above your head... charging against the enemy, screaming and yelling... fighting for your life... and you want us to believe that in the middle of all this excitement you never killed anyone?
You're crazy.
This isn't "piggy-back."
Okay. Hang on to these.
Aren't you afraid of me?
Are you laughing at me, dick-brain?
And you certainly shouldn't settle for anything less that you deserve.
I'd love some, thanks.
This motherfucker sounds charming!
What did he do to Arlene?
Is he nice?
That's true. I do. But I'm gonna have to take outta loan inna bank eight thousand dollars. That's a big note to carry, because I have to give Mr. Gazzara a mortgage, and what I have to weigh is: will it pay off in the end more than I can make onna salary?
Well, I wouldn't call it an elegant profession. It's in a lower social scale. People look down on butchers.
So then Mr. Gazzara -- he was a frienda my father -- he offered me this job in his butcher shop, and everybody pleaded with me to take it. So that's what happened. I didn't wanna be a butcher.
Hey guess what? We're going to the carnival tonight, be ready to go in 10 minutes.
The Mondrian, room 504. The number is 266 7548, plus the L.A. code...
So you gotta get him to admit on tape that he's buying this coke.
Wait a second, I never told you that.
You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
I'm Joel.
I know.
We grew up together. Kids.
Klute. With a K. K - L - U -
I know Tom Grunemann.
Town Police.
Because I go to trial in seven weeks. I've got a lot of preparing to do.
Very nice.
I'll talk to him later.
It's an emergency -- see you some other time.
Possibly.
Yes--but don't ask me why--because I could never tell you. I don't know what most guys want out of life--but that would be enough for me--I wouldn't care about-- easy money--or--showing off my smart brains--I'd just like to live my life so nothing I did would bounce back and ruin hers--Do I make myself clear?
Whatever.
Okay. Promise?
Goodbye.
You can probably buy them on the flight.
I want the treatment plant licenses to be top priority right now.
Oh, hi, Elaine.
Holy God! The mummy walks!
Hospital?
Hello?
No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
Next week.
Next week.
She did?
Under these circumstances we might refuse to sign.
Under these circumstances it's quite a different matter.
Here's my signature -- here Preysing, sign here.
What a session this has been.
See you soon, Preysing. Next week we'll meet and discuss further details.
YOU shut up! They're beautiful, but get them some water.
We're in a shootout, Roy! Shut up about the damn fish!
I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
And I congratulate you.
This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
-- Thanks. I will.
We all try. You succeed.
Thank you. I try.
Your work.
What for?
Clean?
I doubt that.
Italy to Iowa? I'd call that a change.
What's he like?
Let me think a second. It's tough.
Fourteen and he s hoodwinked by a an erector set?
No, no, Martini. Your boss. Where is he?
And I'm not used to -- Marylin -- there's something I want to ask you.
I want... I want to...
I want to be your -- your wife.
No... That wasn't right. I want YOU to be MY wife.
Yes. I am. What else could those words mean? I believe we belong together and we can make one another happy. And we should be happy because happiness is better than the alternative which is -- just jump in any old time, Marylin. You have more experience at this than I do.
That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
What 'look'?
You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
Did you send anyone out there?
You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
Bad idea...
I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
I didn't. You gave me a look!
I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts. Never abandon you instincts.
Like a sickness and its cure together.
Get the shotgun. And her purse. I'd like to know who she is.
I don't care about the team. I care about the school.
You have a charming wife, Mr. Muss -- uh, Sid.
The green-and-whites saw us. One of 'em starts thinking, what's that car doing there? Ties it to the break and turns around...
Do we need him?
Remind me why.
Because it pays off.
But the second mouse gets the cheese.
It's too soon.
The early bird gets the damn worm.
You two make quite a couple.
We're supposed to.
You are?
What did you think then?
Since I was five. My mom's a cocktail waitress.
Someone? Gimme a hint.
I think we're about half way.
What's the matter?! It's a celebration!
Nothin'. She's all right. Wouldn't have made it without her. Christ - haven't worked in eight months. Right now, I'm waitin' for some insurance money. And man, when I get it, I got plans to make me some more. Let's get out'a here. This place gives me the willies. You got some money?
What's the matter?! You mad at me?
He's my son!
I have my own business....I work. I work hard at doing my business.
If it's not too much trouble, I thought I might.
Oh-oh... Maybe I better get back in the truck.
What!
Ok. SEXY VOICE Yeah...that's it...God I Am So Horny...I wish I was there to help you.....I wish I was there for you, Barry.
Yeah.
A shark fin?
Yesterday you were wondering about the wall. How it was possible.
It's Geronimo. Love. It lets you see things. It gives you insight. I've loved you since the first time I saw you.
Why, that's ridiculous! They're responsible for everything that
Yeah... Would you, I mean, could you love me then? If I was normal. Maybe?
You're wrong. Since I met you, I don't dream about holes anymore.
I would never hurt you, Liza. Think whatever you want, but don't think that.
Werewolves simply do not exist.
Yeah. My brother Art got his girlfriend one once.
There's only one thing we can do. We've got to get rid of it. We've got to get an abortion.
Big?
These may have been the jewels of the Duchess Swana, but, like all private property, they were confiscated by the State.
Doesn't sound free to me. So you want me to pay for it?
We can call our ambassador.
-- I have the feeling that, all in all, what I made this voyage for -- has served its purpose.
I like your coat.
You still going away?
You don't have to, now.
Listen, I'll... see you again.
Yes, Mrs. Dreyfuss. He starts out with a worried backward glance toward the two. Fran is just sitting there, the spoon in her hand, not touching the soup.
I've got a wife, Mary. Kids. You know that.
It's fine, Mary. I'm happy to hear it.
It's no big deal.
Well, I have some paper towels --
Were the Princess Lili to join me I would sing till my lungs burst!
You take some awful chances.
Afternoon!
The fax is from Ben, too. Man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...
Mike. I can't believe I'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding. But I think you need and deserve to know...
Well, Mr. Potter, I . . . I . . . I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I . . . I just . . . I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty-four hours to think it over?
Nice. Maybe you'll stop by... have an aperitif...
Well, it's the least I can do.
Oh, well...those are...I mean, we don't get to keep our work. I could maybe ask them if you could choose one. But, you know, frankly George, you were the best. Computer models can't begin to match the beauty you gave yours. They're a part of this firm. They inspire me. I go out there and sometimes just stare at something I've designed. It amazes me. I would miss that too much. Look, I may be going out on a limb, but you go out there and look them over, every single one of them and pick the one you like the best and take it with you. Just run it by me first, just in case, you know...but I'm sure it'll be okay.
Thank you.
What can I do for you, George?
I built my first model here when I was twenty. There are hundreds of them on shelves around the office. Twenty years of my life. I was wondering if I might be able to pick a few to keep, to take home? Only the ones that really mean something to me.
Good. I was hoping for that.
Dancing with you.
The only time people like Dolores used to pay any attention to me was to laugh at me or insult me. That guy, Doug Snell, who shook my hand when we walked in, he used to call me a four eyed worm.
Yup, that's right. Junior prom... kinda.
You asshole, what are you -- Mary! Is that you?
Tell her the truth about Healy! Blow the schmuck out of the water.
Are you crazy? I've unleashed a psycho on her. She's gonna be fucking pissed. She's even more beautiful than I remember.
Well? What are you waiting for?
I don't know what to say.
Well, there was a time when you were very happy to be only with me. You wanted to learn everything about poetry, about music.
What?
A pre-wedding luau?
I asked her if you were happy to see us. I find it hard to tell with you.
Yes it's okay. Thank you for the food.
Right.
I am actor, he is actor, although he is an actor stroke musician. I just noodle along, I'm not so good. He makes me look like a retard -- He smokes me. I don't mean he smokes me.
No.
Right. So I can say he smokes me. So.
So?
So I come to England with other actors to make shows, I meet this freak from Novgorod I tell him of you and Chicken and the birthday here we are.
What was that?
Give me a break, will you. How often do I ask you for something?
No, just a drill.
Nothing. I've got to put up some kitchen shelves that's all. You've got one haven't you?
And a fifty foot extension lead?
Come on, don't me give a hard time. I'm just trying to make the place look nice for Katka.
This guy's gonna kill him.
Good. Tomorrow, after the party.
Mrs. Worthington, I feel I'm very lucky to be here.
You like her?
Oh, I'm sorry, wait a minute, I have something. Well, what about Saturday night?
I'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.
Not the happiest of souls. "Art is a form of catharsis, and love is a permanent flop."
You know, I gotta get there and begin whining soon... otherwise I- Hey... well, are you busy Friday night?
Damn, girl.
I'll go with you--
It's very logical, it's the most logical thing in the world. You wouldn't feel this confined if we could go out with people and have dinner, and a little conversation and so forth...
We were just looking.
Why worry? It was insured--how about that swimming lesson I promised you?
Oh, nothing--only I wondered why you suspected him.
Well, I'll tell you--we picked him up about a year ago-- but could never pin anything on him.
Bollocks. This happens every time I go to the cinema. Average day, my glasses are everywhere -- everywhere I look, glasses. But the moment I need them they disappear. It's one of life's real cruelties.
Oh shit, is that the time? I have to go.
Thanks for your help on the glasses thing.
You're welcome. Did you find them?
Well, I didn't mean it, Alan. Why the fuck would I want to save a homeless shelter?
He was only doing his job.
I'm going to kill him.
You can't kill a President.
He's not a President! He's an ordinary person. I can kill an ordinary person.
Bob...
I can kill a HUNDRED ordinary people.
He's only doing what you told him to.
What I told him to?
I heard you. You said 'cut three hundred million dollars from the federal budget, and you can keep your homeless shelter.'
Yes. Well. My pleasure.
...I read you all the way on the Bontecou thing, and I know where you're coming from. And I'm with you a hundred and one percent.
No, anything is possible. It's up to Joe.
And then they'll kill 'em.
It'll keep the fear of God in the hitters. Trust me.
Morning... Say, you got any gas?
Yeah. I hope you don't mind. I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry. And me.
So I guess this fellow belongs to you. What's his name?
Don't call my men assholes.
I didn't mean they were assholes. I mean if they're leaving, get 'em outta here.
Why don't I have Mickey thrown back into his cell and we can forget the whole thing?
Chill out, Phill. Four deputies and you, I can live with that. We're about ready to go here, so let's get rid of these other assholes.
I guess you'd have to guess. Not having been there with them. Having to guess whether your husband's report was word for word accurate.
Well, he didn't say 'no', did he? Didn't say no hope existed.
So the defendant was encouraged to hope. Or could have been.
Boy, she musta been some talker. She musta been about fifty years old.
She musta kept you inna shadows all night.
See, we're about out... been driving all night. Actually, I don't even have time to explain it to you.
Brush her. Listen, you wanna come with me tonight, or you wanna go with this dog?
I told this dog I was gonna call her today about two-thirty.
Nobody. Loretta is getting married.
I don't like him.
She only wants to do it because her sweetie pie's the teacher.
...Ma???
How come you took your own car?
You didn't plan on fucking him tonight.
You did fuck him, didn't you?
Well that's something.
Didn't you, baby?
Thank you.
Lovebirds.
Barely living, from the looks of it.
Of course they're alive. All nature is living.
Sammy Davis Junior. Terrible car accident. He hasn't been the same since.
Good plan that.
If you find her...
The kiss. May be hard. For you to explain. Because the only fear she really has, is...
Come on now...You can't sit here.
Buddy, the days of the debutantes are ... not what they used to be.
It's O.K...It's O.K...Lets me help you up.
Yes, I got back there finally to keep my promise. To come back for her. And then of course I couldn't I couldn't even do that properly.
You get to the morning and the poison leaks away, doesn't it? Black nights, fucking black nights, when you want to howl like a dog. I thought I would kill you. You killed my friends, you ruined my hands. But the girl was always here, like some Guardian Angel.
The lamp was burning all night in his room. Caravaggio was there with him.
This is hot!
And did you never see Katharine? You never got back to the Cave?
That gun at Lahor, Kipling's cannon - Zamzammah - remember? That was made out of the metal of ordinary things. I want to make an ordinary thing out of guns. His bayonet is thrust into the forge. It's red hot.
When I went to England I was amazed at what went on, the waste - I'd been taught to re-use everything, the dung from a cow to cool a radiator, a fork to fix a typewriter - India could live for a hundred years on what I saw thrown away.
Mission... statement...
I don't know. I'm working on it. I was on the wrong track.
I don't think that's why she ran.
Neuter a locust, feed the world.
Guess you'd know about that. You're an entomologist, right? How's business?
They're not after me. They want the baby.
My car.
My friend, you always surprise me.
You got a real problem with priorities, you know that?
The face decays, the mask doesn't. Art lasts, we don't. That's why art's so valuable. It's a little piece of immortality.
Take this mask. It may look like the Empress, but it's not.
Did I ever tell you what Tina wrote? The night she died?
I really don't think that's a topic on which you have much to offer.
I'd like to know. I'll go along.
Up on the right.
Okay.
What?
Okay. She's really pretty great, isn't she?
Why don't I just get your phone number, that's usually how it works.
Uh, no, not really, no actually, basically, you don't know me. I'm a friend of your daughters; well I sat with her yesterday at the mall.
The truck?
Hey! Do you have any idea how much those beakers cost? I usually charge for hypnosis.
Yeah, she is. Good luck.
She's really pretty great, isn't she?
That's my own flock up there, getting their evening workout. I won plenty of races with 'em. Listen, you want to see them? Come up on the roof with me and I'll show 'em to you.
Pardon me while I reach for my beads.
What-what? Where you been the last four five years? Outer space?
Well he played it smart. Too many good-for-nothin's around here. All they got on their mind's a little beer, a little pool, a little I better get you home.
Boy, they sure fly nice, don't they?
Well?
Where'd you get them antlers?
Well, I don't notice us hustling trash, either.
What you been doing?
She plays the clarinet, too.
Where are our kids? Has he got one of them in there?
You believe this? The kid won't come out. I'm playing 'Camptown Races' for him and the next thing I know he's locked himself in the bathroom. There's nothing sharp in there, is there?
Then don't do it.
Get a pen and don t ask any questions.
And I want to try to make it up to you.
Yes! I'm a shithead! I'm a complete and total shithead!
Just a second!
Shhhh. Your parents are downstairs.
No. I understand perfectly.
Pity, it tells it like it is. That's why the eastern, read Jewish, publishing establishment won't touch it. That's a quote from the book jacket. George Will, I think. I apologize if you can't understan a word I'm saying, Dr. Schwartz.
Just one. Why is this floor so short?
You don't have a speech impediment, Dr. Lester.
I'll be home soon.
Fine woman, Floris. I don't know how she puts up with this damn speech impediment of mine.
Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
No.
Flattery will get you everywhere, my boy. But I'm afraid I have to trust Floris on this one. You see, she has her doctorate in speech impedimentology from Case Western. Perhaps you've read her memoirs, "I can't understand a word any of you are saying."
Why did you jump?
Hello Constance. It's me, Lloyd... nothing, I'm just driving around... she broke up with me... what do I do? Can't she come back? How can I get her back?... I can't think, talk to me... I fucked up... I feel like crying... she gave me a pen. I gave her my heart and she gave me a pen.
I kind of half expected you to thank me.
Would you like to see where I was tattooed?
Sure.
Listen -- all I really want is an estimate.
It's not so bad. You may not be able to lie on your back for a few days -- but, then, you can lie from any position, can't you?
Does it hurt?
Haven't you got a bullet I can bite?
Are you really Carson Dyle's brother?
Would you like to see my passport?
Your passport! What kind of a proof is that?
Yeah. Yeah, not bad. How's your's?
Company, shit. I watch the man's back.
Go about your duties.
Miss Gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.
Can I be of service, Miss Price?
Thank you, Mr. Gillanders. Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather.
All right, what if the defendant heard? So Carl let him aboard, to help. And then the fishing gaff?
Well, what if?
Will you tell me something? Has this ever happened to you before?
Oh, I don't know . . . why not right here? You remember that old tool and machinery works? You tell your father he can get that for a song. And all the labor he wants, too. Half the town was thrown out of work when they closed down.
Huh? Yeah-yeah-yeah . . . soybeans. Yeah.
I'm her father!
... Do you know who I am?
You will? Excellent, alright, this is great. You will, really?
I'm Jack Dawson.
I bet. How much?
Good, good. And your sister... Catherine -- she's still your best friend?
Daniel Burdon, FBI.
Another C.
Nice piece of work.
Max, are we driving through plutonium?
Keeps out the alpha rays, Max. You don't get old.
You're an actor, Max. You should be doing Shakespeare in the Park.
Oh, I did Shakespeare in the Park, Max. I got mugged. I was playing Richard the Second and two guys with leather jackets stole my leotard.
Yeah. I had the feeling that I got you at a bad moment. You know, I heard high-pitched squealing.
And what about your other friends... you don't like playing with them?
Imagine my surprise when I got your call, Max.
Since you put it that way. It's hard for me to refuse. ...have a, I have a terrific problem with authority, you know. I'm... it's not your fault. Don't take it personal.
You see that moon last night?
McMasters, isn't it? Listen, you Seen a black stallion with-
U-n-i-c-o-r-n-... What in heck's that?
There's only two of them now.
Finished, son?
-- and even if I do learn to read, what use'll it be? I'm goin' to live on a ranch!
Of course, Sir. We're checking the entry log, alibis, grudges...
Bah! You faeries have the morals of ferrets.
Hey there ...YOU WITH THE STARS IN YOUR EYES...
I, I, my ears are experiencing a meltdown! I can't hear anything.
What do you mean?
And your mother -- everything's fine with her?
I don't think so. Do you?
How?
Ann! Say, why didn't yuh
Shut up!
Beany!
Pull your hammer back, Smokey's coming at you.
What? I'm sorry, sir, I can't hear you.
Loud and clear.
You're wall to wall and tree top tall.
Bandit?
Yeah?
Oh, of course. Who can forget the Emmy? Then let me bring Betty to the set and see what happens.
Just a minute.
They're from both of us.
A famous actor who's getting married next week.
Um... seventy... something.
That's a good age.
If I didn't give them to you in a concentration camp where you had more "persuasive methods" at your disposal, I certainly won't give them to you now.
You will give us the names?
Yes, even in Berlin. If you will furnish me with their names and their exact whereabouts, you will have your visa in the morning.
Even in Berlin.
I was in a German concentration camp for a year. That's honor enough for a lifetime.
And the honor of having served the Third Reich.
Don't be in such a hurry. You have all the time in the world. You may be in Casablanca indefinitely... or you may leave for Lisbon tomorrow, on one condition.
Is that all you wish to tell us?
You know the leaders of the underground movement in Paris, in Prague, in Brussels, in Amsterdam, in Oslo, in Belgrade, in Athens.
And that is?
Yes. Always have had.
With a goat playing a violin.
Nice technique there... ...Cammi.
You believe they're shooting a Nike ad down there? Did I ever tell you my Nike story?
As much as Joe's?
I was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, Drew. Forgive me. I want you to know I value your advice.
A Soul's Search: Finding Your True Character and calling? Is this yours?
Its bad for you.
It's ok if you are.
You don't have to be embarrassed.
Oh, the record company sent these...
I've got the customers... that's my point. I'm the one they want. If I had my own shop, they'd leave and come to me. I have a lot of customers.
That's right.
All you have to do is phone for it.
No water -- What a place!
We did not approach you.
Oh -- now let's talk like adults. You want to tell us now a along story of what your factory can do. We know all that you could tell us and if you tell the truth it wouldn't sound so good. When you first approached us...
Now to proceed with the projected merger, the advantages for the Saxonia are so obvious...
Tentative my foot -- a month before this your old father-in-law came very privately and scratched at my door.
Just a minute, steward--haven't you forgotten something?
Susan, I don't think Joe is going to be with us long.
Because... well, you said you wanted a man to think enough of you to walk in the place you were working and take you out of there... tonight I was sort of tied up with Steve... but tomorrow I figured on doing just that.
Hello?
Who's under arrest? You pimple-headed, square-toed spy -- do you realize what you're doing?
No? Well -- Johnson, you're under arrest. You, too, Burns.
I recommend Her Majesty uses the covered carriage with a full Horse Guard. In the event of any disturbance I will ensure --
Sure. I wouldn't blame you, either.
So how was it? What was he doing?
Can I get you a drink?
You see, men can feel unfulfilled, too. I'm glad you're realizing that. You shouldn't be so quick to assume that switching bodies would be the answer to all your problems.
That dyin's gonna be done two ways.
Describe Mallory.
I take it your son is called Leon?
Let's get out of here, Elaine. Let's go somewhere else.
Of course not.
Please!
Oh, don't be silly, Walter. I couldn't walk around in the streets without any clothes. I'd be arrested.
As a matter of fact, you came home without any clothes. You were in your - uh - shorts. Yes, sir.
I did what!
You came home last night - without them.
The ones who brought you home, sir. They said you and another gentleman kept walking up and down the streets, shouting: "Back to nature! Clothes are a blight on civilization! Back to nature!"
What two policemen?
That's what the two policemen said, sir.
All right. What did your son say to that effect?
It's time.
I flushed it down the toilet.
If that's what it takes.
I wanted to drive you home. Are you all right?
Your homie, Glenn. Only thing, he went to the men's about a while ago and never came back.
Who's sitting here?
But it hasn't been forever.
You sure you going to be comfortable enough there, Miss... ah... ?
You don't want to know.
Yes.
I know I did. But I don't.
This is....illegal....I'll call the police.
Well, maybe we oughta be stuck here. I'm not saying that I know.
Well, I shouldn't expect miracles, should I?
Never mind. It doesn't matter... If I'm worth a damn, I'll pick the right direction. And if I'm not, well, I don't care. See what I mean?
I can see you're no gentleman--
Denby!--Are you Chad Denby?
That's me!
Not the real Chad Denby?--
So what?
I can see where I won't talk much to you.
-- talking to you...
Why, you ungrateful brat!
Yes. It's for your protection, sweetheart. You're the one with the -- the...
-- the coin?
No. Judge -- just a sec. But Marylin, if we sign it, I can't hope to benefit from the marriage.
Yes. Of course. Very wise.
You're right. You're fired.
The Italian, I presume?
He seems to have won it.
Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
Thank you.
As a matter of fact, I'm a pretty good cook -- but I'm a lousy housekeeper.
Tennis racquet? Oh, I remember -- I was cooking myself an Italian dinner. I used it to strain the spaghetti. FRAN Why not?
It's just that I'm the kind of guy who can't say no -- I don't mean to girls -- I mean --
I was driving back from Apache Wells when they got me on the radio.
Go up the stairs, Judy. I'll follow.
How do you know?
You look like Madeleine, now. Go up the stairs.
And I couldn't follow her. God knows I tried. One doesn't often get a second chance. I want to stop being haunted. You're my second chances, Judy.
Easy, easy --
And he's right! A ballplayer on a streak has to respect the streak. They don't happen very often. You know how hard this game is? If you believe you're playing well because you're getting laid or because you're not getting laid or because you wore red silk panties--then you are! And I still think Thomas Pynchon is full of shit.
You're gorgeous, God damn it! From the moment I first saw you I knew I had to have you. I had to have you!
I think of you and the "boy" all the time.
Nuke won't go to bed with you, eh?
Aren't we all?
You don't know any way you'll trust me?
Nothing comes to mind.
Masons been around a long while.
Treasure hunter?
And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
I'm sure that's true for some of them.
Or that he can't be bothered to write us a proper letter? A dissertation on apples, we don't need!
Yes?
I noticed. I'm on the noon back. We have this thing with George's family in the Hamptons.
We'll get separated over the target, but you and I will rendezvous for the run to China. I'm on your wing.
What?
Hey, Terry, front and center.
Don't you believe in love at first sight?
Stow the receipt. I'll take the cash.
Hey, Skins --get away with that sheet metal all right?
But you never can tell. Why don't you get that new rifle out of the wagon?
Yeah, it does.
Have you cleared all the rubble up?
Later. Jahn, I've been let down by the guys who were going to do the flooring. They brought the materials but took my money and ran. You guys have a school theatre don't you?
You're all bloody useless.
So I hear, do you know some of the stage hands?
Power dive!
It's Germans!
Bandits at 2 o'clock.
Not really.
Doesn't surprise me. I meet a lot of people like that.
So. Where have you been staying for the last week?
That must be the tenth alienist they've had on Williams. Even if he wasn't crazy before, he would be after ten of those babies got through psychoanalyzing him. Gimme the desk.
Now we'll both call him.
Yo, yo, yo...
I carry bacon in my pocket.
He was. He died.
Yeah.
Would you leave now, please?
It's OK. It's OK.
I thought you didn't do adolescent secrets.
Maybe she got jealous of Johnny Boz, too.
You're about to hit a convoy. Tighten up your rubber band. The oncoming's clear.
Bandit II?
Fixing a leak under your sink.
Thank you, sir.
You're coming up to the scale house.
I'm here.
But isn't that the duty of art? To elevate us above the beast?
What kind of talk is that? So you got a little over- emotional -- but you're fine now.
Frank. Where s Alan Mintz? Is he here yet?
A shelter?! I m the richest guy in the building...I ve got twice the square footage you have!
Maybe you re not hearing me. I am Jack Campbell... Right here. Jack Campbell, President...
Look, I don t know what s going on here but I am Senior Vice President of this company.
I do not.
I don't think about it.
Names, a phone number, something... Listen, Ballard told me that the guy who brought the missing car down from Detroit was murdered, but do you see him doing anything about it? If Ballard wasn't such a stubborn ass, I wouldn't have to be breaking in here...
Look Joyce, I need your key to the files, not advice, okay? This is a complex case.
You'd like that wouldn't you? You've hated Betty since you were in Pep Squad together...
Ahh, I hate this town! Places like this just make you small... I should have never come back here after college.
Then why did you go see Mr. Koehler in the first place?
Hi, Joe.
I need to ask you a question. What made you get in touch with Joanne Braslow?
I'm not asking for names or specifics. I just want to know what prompted you to make the call?
What?
And what exactly is it that you can't take anymore of?
Seems I am.
What am I supposed to say?
No, Alfredo, I was coming to help you...
Let me help you.
Suppose you just answer, Miss Jane. Now, will you tell the Court what everybody at home thinks of Longfellow Deeds?
Miss Kubelik -- -- you shouldn't be out of bed.
What plane.
M'sieu ...
Deceased.
Yes they are.
Why's that?
When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
I don't have a choice.
What would?
You let me make a fool of myself.
Edna! Come dance with me! Let's be foolish tonight.
I suppose it wouldn't hurt to meet him. What's his name again?
I just hope he won't expect us to say Grace all the time.
I am Michael Simonovitch Iranoff.
Positively not!
No, that's not him...
That must be the one!
Yes, he looks like a comrade!
This is a fine thing. Maybe we've missed him already.
How can you find somebody without knowing what he looks like?
Gluck.
Five seconds. Then you die.
Three...
The acid bath?
Pick up your cards and let's go.
Well, for one thing, you can't spell. And secondly -- if you did something like that -- you'd hate yourself.
You are?
You bet. I got a terrific hand.
I said, I mean no harm... I thought this as empty tomb.
Oh, no, never... nothing like that... never crossed my mind.
I pray God grants it me.
I didn't know... I --
Well, er... no. I mean, you don't look like dragons I've heard of.
I prefer to call it an exodus from an undesirable place.
You sure? A Coke or a Perrier or something?
It's Robert.
If ya don't pay Gazzo, ya end up hangin' on the hook, right?
I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for just one second here -- Do you mind?
Oh, Jesus. You wanna tell me what the problem is here, or --
Erin, you're a big girl. If you got a problem with Jane, work it out for yourself. I don't have time to deal with --
There were others.
Stop it. You are blowing a great opportunity here, Miles. Fucking Maya, man. She's great. She's cool. She's funny. She knows wine. What is this morose come-down bullshit? These girls want to party. And what was that fucking ten-minute lecture on, what was it, Vouvrays? I mean, come on!
Oh Jesus, Miles.
Let's just say I'm uncomfortable with the whole scenario.
Shut up. Shut your face.
Now, Dave, something has come up and I think we need to talk about it...
Should we get dessert?
Don't you see how Maya's looking at you? You got her on the hook. Reel her in! Come on, let's rachet this up a notch. You know how to to do it. Here. Drink some agua.
The cashier at the general store was very dangerous.
Keep this job, ya eat better.
What do you mean?
But if it's someone else I do.
You ready for this? I've recently discovered that our good friend Mrs. Caldwell is the one who sent the letter to Annette urging her to stay away from me.
I'll just help myself to a cocktail.
It's always so quiet here.
My dear sir, I would gladly change rooms with you.
Ach! Here you are, Doctor Zinnowitz.
Watch? --
Excited.
-- A Muncie girl! Can you beat that!
Oh, of all the foolish... Listen, do you take shorthand? Are you familiar with the mimeograph machine?
That was a mistake. The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me. Iceman, power Lloyd. My assault on the world begins now. Believe in myself, answer to no one... You probably got it all figured out, Corey. If you start out depressed, everything's kind of a pleasant surprise.
It is not your company. It's a public company. And I am going to acquire it. Either I buy from the other stock holders, or I buy from you.
Well, then, did you ever get any indication that she wanted to leave her husband?
What do you mean?
Mrs. Blaine? I can tell you right now, without a doubt, that your granddaughter is alive, and did not kill Del Sizemore.
...why do you think you have to be missing a piece of your soul to kill somebody?
What are you talking about? Killing's totally natural. It's dying that isn't natural...
You see, it s like we re in each other s heads...
... this is... uh... too funny...
I'm not. I mean I've gotta see this friend of mine for a few minutes.
I'ma be in the NBA. You're gonna be my cheerleader.
Listen, baby, don't leave, really.
That, and... I'll be done in a minute.
Oh, hey...
What do you want from me, Father.
Then why are you eating alone?
Nuts to you too!
I got her under control. She just acts crazed in public to keep up the image.
You're the one with balls, Dick, say something like that to someone like Glenn. Or maybe you just forgot where you were for a minute.
We were lovers.
But Your Honor--
Let's hope I can say the same about you one day.
Forget her sister, then.
I looked everywhere. I even went to his house. It's locked up.
I'm kind of nervous. I've never been away from Mandrake Falls in my life. Kind of like to see Grant's Tomb, though.
I can understand that. We'll take a walk around town, meet you at the train at four o'clock. Congratulations, Mr. Deeds. You're one of the richest men in the country. We'll see you later. Goodbye and thank you.
See you later, kid.
I don't wanna hurt your feelings.
Hear what he said? You know how much twenty million is?
I can't find him.
You can't?
Oh, how do you mean?
Yeah, yeah, it's up to me, it's up to me he says it's up to me.
Look Jack I m late. I d love to help you out some more but I gotta go handle my business... Happy trails.
Do I look like I live in a bottle?
What s this, a signal? Will you come whenever I ring it?
Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
That s it? That s all I get?! A glare?!
By way of Chicago?
Yeah! Listen to this part. This is where it really takes off!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Gee-zooie!! You better slow down!!!
That was...wonderful! I've never felt anything like that in my life.
I think you know all of us, except for Geoffrey and Katharine Clifton, who've recently come out from England.
This is Clive Fenelon-Barnes.
Thanks for dinner. I never saw anybody cook potatoes that way.
Elliot tells me you're fronting for a dirty cop.
Hey, mon, I don't know what your trip is, but...
You want her dead, don't you?
You can't be serious.
She's blackmailing you, right?
No.
Ted, I'm the kind of guy who shoots from the hip. Now I want you to level with me: Did you knock this skirt up?
No.
I don't buy it.
You don't buy what?
Do you really expect me to believe this is a straight stalker case?
I'm not a stalker! She's a friend of mine.
Heathcliffe didn't howl.
She's not a suspect, sir, she's a witness. Could I ask you to step outside, please.
Sir, I am just trying to do my job, it's standard procedure to question the witness alone. Help me out here, could you please leave.
Yes... a kiss... salute!
No! No!
No! No!
Right: Lovers of the world unite!
I know... it's the Russian soul.
Thank you. Grace, there is one other thing...
Oh, come on--you and Grandma think anybody who works with their hands is a peasant. When Dad--
I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
Need any company?
It means a lot that you came by.
Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
I wish you'd tell me.
You did!
I've got some very important news - I've seen Wynant.
You did... where?
I'm fine. I'm going to live a long time. That's what I called to tell you.
What? Who?
Fine. I won't say anything. You can marry Count Dracula.
Yes.
Have you seen my wallet?
Naturally there will be a few incidental expenses. That is the proposition I have for whoever has those letters.
That's it... Herbert Macaulay.
And the carrying charges?
I don't know anything -- I've been in California for four years. What about his lawyer? Used to be a guy named Mac-- something.
Don't start worrying about him. He's a good guy, but screwy.
So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. It's too convenient.
At last! I know how much you want this. You're gifted and extremely determined, but... it's not up to me.
Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell?
Vivian's in sales.
Hear me out. I've known you a long time. I see a difference in you this week. Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
Why do you want to know?
The night I left your house, I was lost. I was looking for directions.
Doing what?
Yes...
He said he'd be at the gas station at six.
What kind of talk?
He had a girlfriend?
Nilsen?
Was she ever a suspect?
Thanks.
Her?
Are you kidding?
I don't know where to go.
We'll find you a hotel.
Not too expensive -- I'm not a lady of leisure anymore.
Something modest but clean -- and near enough to UNESCO so you can take a cab when it rains -- okay?
It's not exactly what I'd call a large turn-out.
Don't ask me -- I'm only the widow. If Charles had died in bed we wouldn't even have him.
Yeah. Larry Shelton. Blackie. Couple others. Donna said even Lloyd called the other day. Nothing like a little absence to make the heart grow fonder, huh?
Now let's keep going here.
You know, that night, I ... It just all came up.
Oh. Fine. It was nothing. Couple sore knuckles. Nothing.
How're your hands?
Charlie called.
I can keep the beat.
I mean, you can play. You're okay.
Yeah, I know. Me, too.
All right, I'll work on it, I'll, do some research. But in the meantime, don't get crazy.
For god's sake, woman, I'm just trying to keep you safe!
How about you Brutus?
All I'm saying Honey is run the thing past me for Christ's sake before you get up and broadcast the crap.
You're outnumbered Kat two to one, got to go with the majority, that's democracy.
So what's it going to be, Coogan's or U Vayvudoo?
Yeah, let's check out the low-life.
Sure.
Araby?
Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
My play.
What play?
Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
And live on your salary, I suppose?
Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey Let me know when you're quitting.
Araby, my eye !
Hey. I got another question for you.
My right nostril?
Which nostril am I breathing through?
This in ridiculous. I'm a pro.
Looks lonesome--Bring him over here.
Meaning me?
I'm cute, too.
I thought only punks fought with knives.
We were just studying.
Chicken?
I don't know. That's why I'm asking you.
There are no charges against you. I'm here to decide if I'm going to represent you should that occur. Did you kill him?
Everybody goes there.
And look at this. Russell came around on the trade bill.
Alan, we still have to control this guy...
Couple of days. Anyhow, look at these tracking polls, they'll burn up in your hands: seventy- three percent with seniors, eighty- four with working mothers...
When does it break?
Remember that First Liberty stuff we almost got nailed on?
I don't want him caring about his wife! What about the Vice President!
It's gonna be great. 'Caring about his wife.' 'Spending time on her favorite issue...'
Oh. Excuse me.
It's a homeless shelter.
Having considered my position here at court, I have come to the conclusion that it is in the best interest of Your Majesty that I should resign.
My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him.
Ma'am?
...So then in '94 I went back to Dade Community College for a semester and when the Wal-Mart cashier job fell through I hooked up with the Pizza Barn.
What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
Money.
Why don't you try him again?
To fly jets. To be the fastest motherfucker in the world. You gotta come and visit me. I'm only a couple hours away.
Good.
No, that should be more than --
Talk to me in the morning. I feel like shit.
But it can't wait.
No. But that's not the only issue here, sweetheart. There's a lot more to it than that.
My responsibility as its father, for one. I mean, if I've made you pregnant, I'd want to... do the right thing.
...I'd want to pay for the abortion... I'd want to be with you through the whole thing... by your side. So how late are you, Lynette?
Calm down, Sweet Pea. She seen a doctor?
See them, Elaine?
Sure, you do what ya want. Stay away from the stock market.
Rick, hide me. Do something! You must help me, Rick. Do something!
Don't be a fool. You can't get away.
Rick! Rick, help me!
Which floor?
So, what does it mean. The ark sank and the sun set?
I got big ideas, though!
Ya know, entry level!
Just got hired today!
For instance, take a look at this sweet baby...
Clarence, I gotta hand it to ya. You were cooler than cool.
-- this guy with Jill.
You at least bring the gun?
I'm a tourist.
There. You see the guy sitting on the porch? The old ladies and one guy? You know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.
I said I'd give you a interview. Now unless I'm mistaken, we just did a interview. We did an interview, didn't we?
I guess Adele's in good hands.
Let's go to Detroit.
Sure looks that way.
Jane, there was an envelope in my desk. The one I d given you and then got back, remember? I can t find it. Do you know where it is?
Inconvenient is trying to find a pulsing laser with magic arms in two days.
You are a miracle worker.
Sure wouldn't want you to be uncomfortable.
If we don't bypass it, the temperature in the Mask room will change and set off the alarm. That would be inconvenient.
We might not want to cash in our chips just yet. She has another job after this one. A big one.
This is big enough.
It's never big enough.
Let me ask you, this Mask, when they made it--was the old bitch dead or alive?
Oh right.
Here we go.
Oh hi. Forget something?
I apologize for the 'surreal but nice' comment. Disaster...
I kept thinking what a great break it was for me to get to see you tonight. More than a great break, maybe just what I needed...just when I needed it...Angel of mercy -- godsend...lifesaver...what?
Well, she picked the most prosperous looking one.
Ahh, complications during child birth, she died two days after Vada was born.
Oh, that was Phil, trying to give me advice on dating 70's women. Look I'm so out of touch, I haven't dated women in ages, not since my wife died.
No, why?
Yeah.
Well it certainly looks bigger that it seems.
That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll have to remember later on.
Wanted to give you props on making First Team All-American. And then when Magic retired, I tried calling you again.
Japan? What's she doing in Japan?
What do you mean?
Lose something?
Look it's very simple. You tell me everything that hasn't been invented yet, and I'll invent it. We'll be partners. Fifty fifty.
But you said she was a sparkplug...?
Not for me, buddy. I don't drink anymore.
Fuckin' animals. Hey, what do you say we go grab a couple drinks.
Big time.
Stalker, huh?
Nah, some guy threw me a few bucks to track down his high school girlfriend.
You should thank me -- that girl was not easy to find. What'd she scam you out of-some insurance dough?
What can I tell you? It's a healthier lifestyle down here, and it's easier to succeed when your head's clear. Those guys I worked with back in Boston, they were a bad influence.
Okay? With this pad, the killer wheels? Looks like you really cleaned up your act.
I'm doing okay. I gotta get ready for work.
Very nice.
No! It's easy -- it's very easy!
Just one second --
Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here! Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
I'll explain it tomorrow!
This kid, Joe Early, is going to beat the shit out of me.
They found us before. The plan didn't work. I don't know what to do now.
Oh dear.
Howard, they've disappeared again.
I'm a wolf?
You don't know nothing about it.
And replaced it later with the new one. That's your inference?
Hey, good morning, Barry.
I'm not interested in what your interior decorator would think, okay?!
Look I-I-I'll be okay. I'll be okay.
Now, look, you-you-you go on ahead.
Diane, I'm not asking you to sever all relations with the boy. Give him a present, here, let him know you still care. Give him this pen.
Eddie.
Fine. You?
I'm not much for sweets.
Huh? Oh, no.
Could you not take some occasion without giving?
Yes dad.
Okay.
Dad! I know!
I know, Dad.
I'm not doing it!
No one would blame me if I left!
I'd rather sell my nuts to a castrati.
I don't beg.
And I don't take a shower in the middle of the yard.
I can promise you complete privacy.
Oh, if I could do that I'd--I'd turn Burglekutt into a toad!
Jeanne, calm down, do you hear me? Are you alright?
You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything?
Seven o'clock then.
Well, I don't know what else to say. It's a helluva party --
Give me your car keys, will you, I'm going back to my hotel.
I know.
Aren't you? After today?
No. I was being unrealistic. Even thinking about living this life.
Nonsense -- you're only saying that because no one ever has. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 57.
Okay. You want a story? Here's a story. Stifler finds this beer, right? And...
Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
Oh, I've got stories, believe me. They're a little more risque than tales of Band Camp.
Stifler's mom got it in the divorce.
Come on, Kevin. Vicky's looking for you.
There it is. I want to grab my bag. Oh, and my date.
-- A brillo pad, I don't care, anything.
But --
Who the hell is taking the time to write letters, spreading this shit about me?
Well maybe you should get to know the person before you judge them instead of listening to some bullshit gossip.
Look, I've got a lot of problems and I'm trying to deal with them and the last thing I need is people spreading shit about me.
Fine, forget it. It's obvious that we're not going to be friends.
Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
Materially or spiritually?
You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
By my head here come the Capulets.
And what am I supposed to do with my life, huh? I am 28 years old! I work in a low-paying, low-status, zero-respect job which, unfortunately, I happen to fucking love. How inconvenient.
Are you kidding?
Well, forgive me for screwing up your plans!
It's bad.
Because sunlight will kill him. Quickly now, give me the key.
Because I found out for certain that he didn't commit the murders.
A month.
Right and don't embellish.
I promise. I won't.
Aye. Hurry now, Gump, the key!
No.
Mean you to seek him out below?
I'm not afraid of the dark.
I admire your valor, Jack. By all means, seek him out... But first, we needs visit the kitchen.
What is this, a joke, right? Some kind of elaborate practical joke? At my 40th reunion, we delivered a casket to the Class president's hotel room and --
What the hell is this? Who are you?
Damn few places you can make eighty bucks a week.
Well, I don't get on so well most places.
That's fine with me. Keeps me out of trouble.
By my heel, I care not.
What s the difference? I m taking my baby out for our anniversary, damn the costs...
Joe, could I ask you to take a walk? Buy a tie or something. I know I'll be seeing you.
Of course.
Yes, I am. There's a research lib- rary on the fourth floor. Why don't you go down and read some magazines?
You're not thinking of going some- where, are you, Bill?
Now I'd like to be alone.
Oh. Okay.
Jennifer, give Mr. Black a map of the city.
No thank you, Bill. I can manage.
How do you think I felt -- riding home on that seven-fourteen train?
Look... Do you wanna fuck me?
But, Hildy -- I can explain --
Was waiting till I knew you better. Johnny Dancer, huh? Sounds like a racehorse.
What'll it say?
That's fine --
What the hell is this?
Don't chew it, you won't have it that long. Easier to clean the cockpit if it comes up in big chunks.
They should have warned you about that one.
What'd you do?
I think there's a Seven-Up in there.
What?
Yeah--but high livin's made me soft.
No, it's the Great and Powerful Oz. Now listen--you're in over your head. This is how it's gonna work. I review the tapes, I find your story.
I don't want to place you in any position --
Allow me, Comrade.
Danny...
Yes you can.
Go to the liquor store - Where is there a liquor store around here?
It's your mistake.
What do I need a thief for? I've got the Mask.
Okay, you're a thief.
You're playing both sides of the street. You're going to keep the Mask and turn me in.
You want a name from the present? How about Hazel Dobkins?
There is no big job.
How much time do they get to spend with their dad?
It's just that there's less that Adam and Ryan can do anymore. I'd hate to have them bored.
I can hire workers to help me.
I'd rather you not be here.
Come on. You can't be serious.
No.
Eh... yes.
No.
Delly, shhhhhh...
I would. But I've got a weak stomach.
Of course. And is he your favourite Italian film director?
... and what... what did he say?
It's okay. Edward told me. Your secret's safe with me.
Ah, Craig. Just the fellow I wanted to see. Juicer! Easy as pie. Just keep your fingers clear of the blade, and never, never use it while bathing in a tub full of water.
I sort of do. But I only see it as a fantasy version of reality. Cleaned up enough to be erotic.
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.
Somebody else is going to get it.
Insolent young cub!
Can you pay some attention to me?
It's agreed -- I will get a room here for you.
Of course -- of course.
Baron!
Gay? He said you were gay?
Yeah, it's like tradition or something.
Ts! Ts! Ts!
Oh, this is all right, Bruce. I just wanted to be sure.
Sally--!
But--
But no, I'm sure I can get out of it.
Madeleine --
It had to. We're in love. That's all that counts. Madeleine --
Madeleine!!
Um-hum!
Hey, you gonna start knocking my hobbies? Jesus!
Yeah, yeah... any chance you'll get back to work today?
It's either meatloaf, Swiss steak or charred flesh. I won't know till it's finished.
You ask them.
Go on, ask them.
Maybe, maybe we can adopt a child. He said you could adopt one--
That's what you have to say? How could it be true? I never even heard of any procedure like this. It's a joke.
But a fabulous cook.
I did it! Madmartigan! Come here! Look! You gotta see this! I did it!
Look, I have to go. I have to think.
Lee... you are the only person I can be with...who I really look forward to being with.
Raziel! I transformed them all! I'm a magician!
Who?
He was watching a ball game on television.
Leave Me!
Oh, nuthin'.
It s okay. Hell, I ve never paid for it. But please don t feel like you have to explain yourself to me.
You quitting?
Six one.
Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?
I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be you.
They don't have any shit.
I swear.
I nearly died when we split the bill.
Minimizes the risks. Children can be moved across borders using reliable businesses. These can also be used to move women and drugs... Anything that makes money really.
The hotels are useful capital investments. The kids liquid assets. My guess is they own hotels across the globe, and travel agencies specialising in flights from the third world to boot.
What?
You watched the tape? Friedman and his people don t just provide little kids and videotapes, Mrs De Moraes. They re in the import-export business. They run hotels here in London which they probably use as ware- houses and ports of call for their merchandise.
The man who sold the boy to your brother.
St-rike!
You're on.
I hope you don't have any doubts about that.
Apologize to Elizabeth for me.
What are you talking about?
Goodnight.
Goodnight.
So what do we do -- nothing?
We'll be there.
No.
and thus unable to declare her love
Hi.
Just be friendly and say "no comment."
Denver got very silent about a day ago. San Diego's got a fever for Cush. This stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. People get crazy. And San Diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. Signing bonus of eight. Million.
Not now.
You're in the wrong business, Jack--you're Sears-Roebuck material!
Come on! Hurry up! Breakfast'll be ready in no time.
They're okay.
You tossed my hat out the window.
You ever had to open it up like that before?
Mmmmm.
No.
I didn't stop to think, Clay.
You better start.
So grab yourself some sleep while you have the chance.
Like I said, I was thinkin' of the horses.
You stretch out. I'll fix something to eat.
All right, I hurt your feelings. But you know better than to go lightin' fires.
Look, I think maybe you better not mention getting your wings around here.
They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!" The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!" Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!" Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio.
I like that.
Sleepy suddenly.
Well, we'll just have to wait and see, won't we?
Good night, my little darling.
Yes?
What the devil? What kind of fools do we have here? Pottle, who told the lad this story?
Well that's your problem. Hey Virge, see anything of Doc while You were in Prescott?
Hit a streak when we left. Him And Kate.
Got me. Somethin'. Nothin'. I Don't know.
Must be a real soft pillow.
Sounds high, doesn't it?
You wanted to be partners with me?
But there's something profound here, Maxine, we can't exploit it.
Tickets to Malkovich?
Yes, of course. He's a celebrity.
Lots of things. He's very well respected. That jewel thief movie, for example. The point is that this is a very odd thing, supernatural, for lack of a better word. It raises all sorts of philosophical questions about the nature of self, about the existence of the soul. Am I me? Is Malkovich Malkovich? Was the Buddha right, is duality an illusion? Do you see what a can of worms this portal is? I don't think I can go on living my life as I have lived it. There's only one thing to do. Let's get married right away.
Well what do you think happens When you die?
Really? What about hell? They got A sign or what?
Hey, Wyatt, God damn it, I'm serious!
Oh fuck, Norman!
What did you think it would be?
Demented.
Heart be still.
Uh, no. How do I get to Beverly Hills?
That I'm used to.
Why? 'Cause I... was walkin' along a block behind you staring at you? That's not following!
I didn't follow you!
Paranoid? I'm looking at you. You got your arms around another guy.
Following is different. I was spying.
Yeah-well, I didn't start out spying. I-I thought I'd surprise yuh. Pick you up after school.
But you hated four out of the five you did.
I'm freezing
What?
What do you want to do now?
C'mon. I bought 'em for you, to make up for that night.
We're fine. Turkey sandwiches.
Well, how do you know? Did she discuss it with you?
Well, let's say I live in it. Such a pleasant place... all kinds of comfort, easy to reach, close to street car, bus, and subway...
Please don't misunderstand me...
What a city! There are the Grands Boulevards... blasted out of the heart of the old streets. The Arc de Triomphe... made to greet Napoleon's army. The Opera! And Montmartre... Montparnasse... La Boh me... and now I'll show you the greatest attraction! It will cost me a franc but it is worth it. The most wonderful spot in all Paris -- unique! Here, look.... What do you see?
It's not the structure but the spirit which dwells within. There are three rooms and a kitchenette dedicated to hospitality.
Thank you. I'm Rob.
Now I didn't say that either... naturally nothing would please me more.
He divorced his wife -- he married Marylin -- he divorced Marylin -- and he -- remarried his WIFE? What kind of sick --
Yes, I know Howard Doyle.
Did Marylin end up with money?
He never ate the pre-nup, did he!
I don't have a pre-nup
No, man.
And then there is copper, which is the only pipe I use. It costs money. But it costs money because it saves money.
Are you insinuating anything, M'sieu Giron?
Thinking.
Go ahead, driver! Ball park!
It's a league record.
Nope.
What do you think's going on?
Can you give me some room here?
Oh yeah. Sure.
You know, in life you gotta strike when the iron's hot.
Thanks, Jack.
Nice shot.
You're an asshole.
What about your agent? Hear anything yet?
Yes?
Enough, Liz.
Isn't that how it is for everybody?
Jeanne's been badly injured! She jumped from the top of a tower into a frozen moat!
It's a miracle she's not dead!
Easy to fix. Wyatt Berry Stapp Earp.
Fortuitous even.
You guess? My parole was broke two hundred miles back when we burnt Portagee County.
What do you mean by necessary? She's prob'ly already called the cops, my parole officer, her p.i. boyfriend Johnnie Farragut.
That don't smell like a More.
You got about six more big states to go before we find out.
They sure do stink.
What s the date?
It is, Thomas, but of good reputation. Come, there is no harm in a drink.
So that's how we stand, Baron.
I must have made a mistake.
You're a funny little creature, Flaemmchen. I can't make you out.
Bid her to come to confession this afternoon; And there she shall at Father Laurence' cell Be shrived and married.
I'll find some copy. Be right back.
I don't like being handled.
What?
Your coat jacket is rising up in back.
No. That's not going to tell us anything. Let's get this prompter going.
It's not loaded.
Sit on it! Now look.
Finished what?
Which one?
Yeah, but it's all about Simon now... you helped with the dog... And now there are other things. I'm just as concerned as you are about Simon.
I hope so, sir. Golly I never knew it could be so exciting.
This calls for a celebration. Doesn't it?
He was still warm when they confirmed.
The next time you feel the urge to visit the Marquis, I hope you'll come to confession instead.
Madeleine --
Thirty-three--
In faith, I believe you are not; for a lad I never saw more game in my life. Give me a kiss, my dear boy. You're after my own soul. As long as Jack Grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.
Have you taken my message to him?
Hello! . . . Yeh?
No. Her mother's awful worried about her. When she left the house she said she was going on a roaring drunk. Er, the girl, I mean!
Go out and find her!
Hey, do you know something? She supports a mother and two kids. What do you know about that?
Did you find her?
Pardon me, m'sieu, but I have the feeling we have met somewhere before.
Did you get her name?
It's never too soon! Girls decide how far to let you go in the first five minutes.
All right... where did you see her?
Did you get her number?
I would. Yeah.
Cocaine is the last thing a man in his condition would want.
Yes.
We know Marsh had a head cold. We found cocaine mixed with water in a nasal spray container on the nightstand. The coke would contract the nasal membrane the same as any decongestant, but for a much shorter time. He'd keep using more and more -- never knowing what he was taking.
What do you think?
Come in.
Because -- I am.
I'm leaving.
In vino veritas.
Comrades, why should we lie to each other? It's wonderful.
Let's be honest. Have we anything like it in Russia?
Madame Colet, I think you deserve a scolding. First, you lose your bag--
Sure am, who are you?
Maggie...Maggie's little girl.
I was hoping I'd get to meet you.
I gotta go meet Kelly for a drink downstairs. She wants to talk about some photo thing.
You wanna come?
I know what you need.
Oh, but Doctor. The music -- the champagne -- girls when they dance -- all the shining ice in those big silver things -- That's life --
Life! -- Mr. Kringelein, you are drunk -- good night.
But Doctor --
The Grand Hotel.
Anne, they're MY moods. If you want to understand moods, have one of your own!
We gotta slow down. I'm so tired. Let's just get out of here.
See, I told you!
This whole week has gone sour. It isn't turning out like it was supposed to. I want to go home.
Please, it's real hot, maybe we can go swimming?
Hi Vada, can you come out?
How come serial killers have two names, but lone gunman assassins have three. John Wilkes Booth. Mark David Chapman. Lee Harvey Oswald.
Why are there two deeds here?
Thanks.
All right... Sorry... I feel indebted to him.
He trusts you?
Take my advice, don't buy any...
Ellie, you know I think it's about time we got outa this place, get us a house of our own. We can afford it now.
I can't help girls coming up to me.
Think I should put the skateboard in bed with him?
It's okay, little baby.
What?
Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
No, I just made that up. Do you want to hear one?
Or Kat....
The police department?
I'm into garbage. It's my thing.
What do you think, eightball?
A ray of oneness piercing the solitude. Falling bodies in the ecstasy of flesh. You'll be a chapter in my memoirs of desire.
You haven't seen the worst of it. These last few days I've been very controlled. I knock things over... I throw up all the time. Now I feel really good... You're like some kind of antidote that mixes the liquor and keeps me in balance, but that won't last forever. You'll get tired of it really quickly. Believe me.
Don't you think you'll get a little bored living with a drunk?
Sera you are crazy.
Don't be silly?
No, I meant, it's awfully dangerous.
But . . ..that's terrible!
Does Lois know about this yet?
What??
Beware the moon. The full moon, David. You've got two days.
Jack, please go away. Please go away.
Remember what that guy at The Slaughtered Lamb said? 'Beware the moon.'
Stop it, Jack.
David, please believe me. You will kill people, David. You've got to stop the bloodshed before it begins.
Nurse!
You'll stalk the streets of London a creature of the night.
You're talking like Boris Karloff! It's movie dialogue!
Listen to me! Take your own life, David. It's our only chance.
Nurse!
We're here.
We'll see about that.
I don't know, I can't say --
When I get off work.
See you later.
Some example you set.
Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
Then come with us.
What are they saying?
Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
Now hold on. There's a lot of people who think being a cop is a legitimate job.
We're running out of time. And this strutting martinet... ...isn't letting any men in at all.
Not much else.
Lisbon?
Hey, Lou, gimme two bottles-a beer...
Waddaya read there, Joe?
I'm sorry. Really... I am.
Well, then logging got to be too much like work, so I went down to Los Angeles to the pier in Santa Monica. That's a swell place, they even have a rollercoaster. I sketched portraits there for ten cents a piece.
Do you like them?
My wife talks to his wife about what shift I'm gonna take?
Let me drive...
Very cool. Trippy.
That's a good one.
It's a good one all right.
What's your bartlett's?
It's a quote book.
Yeah. Cool.
Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
Suppose Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring was among the jewelry he has in the handbag. During that phone conversation he held up three rings -- one with a diamond -- one with a big stone of some kind -- and one plain gold band.
Any time--day or night. You calmed down enough to go back now?
You serious?
Here. Look, will you do something for me? If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze. It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks.
Okay--
I'm sorry.
Luck, Jim. Don't forget.
Have some cigars.
Do you always begin conversations this way?
So how was it?
That... was... no... simulation.
I know. I'm sorry...
I have been to the dark side. I have seen a world that no man should ever see.
This portal is mine and must be sealed up forever. For the love of God.
With all respect, sir, I discovered that portal. Its my livelihood.
It's my head, Schwartz, and I'll see you in court!
You look... uh... You look fine.
I'll be back.
How come you're not at lunch with the girls? You're a girl.
You're a girl.
Hey. I like working with you.
I only found out you were here yesterday.
You've never seen her run.
What happened on the charges?
What lesson do get outta that story, Lula?
What's that, peanut?
Dumper, the man Bree Daniel mentioned and Arlyn Page knew and Jane McKenna knew.
You said he was no possible connection with Tom. The Page girl told you that, not Tom.
That who?
Is there something going on between us?
Describing you. A square from out there. I mean you're nowhere. Miss Four Corners.
Why don't you come join me for a swim and we'll discuss it.
Oh come on. Quit acting like a geriatric and get in the pool.
Several times. I'm not as dumb as I act, you know. When Howard Roark makes love to Dominique Francon... most romantic scene in all of literature.
That's a matter of opinion.
Please.
You mean like career? Uh, I don't know. I've, I've thought about this quite a bit sir, and I'd have to say considering what's waiting out there for me, I don't want to sell anything, buy anything or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or... process anything sold, bought or processed, or repair anything sold, bought or processed, you know, as a career I don't want to do that. So, uh, my father's in the army, he wants me to join, but I can't work for that corporation, so what I've been doing lately is kickboxing, which is really a, uh, new sport, but I think it's got a good future. As far as career longevity goes, I don't really know, because, you know, you can't really tell. Your training sticks as a fighter, you know, but it's no good, you know, you have to be great, but I can't really tell if I'm great until I've had a couple of pro fights. But I haven't been knocked out yet. I don't know, I can't figure it all out tonight sir, I'm going to hang with your daughter.
No, really.
That's a nice teapot.
You don't look eighty.
You look as if you could.
Certainly a new experience for me.
No, not if you've got better things to do.
When your ready Son!
Jennifer, you want to have another drink?
There's no gang in there -- We were the last ones.
I didn't think you'd make it.
I don't mean how'd you do the paperwork, I mean how the hell did you do it without letting me in on it?
The Colonel helped me work it out.
He's alright, but my Dad can take him.
Your Dad play?
My Dad plays for the "Clippers." He says I'ma be a doctor or a lawyer, but I'ma play for them, too. Same number and everything.
So how come you could play basketball?
I never knew a girl that could play.
Thank you, Sid, but the reason I mention it is, it would require such a small capital investment -- again, you're the expert here --
Damnit, where's my car!
...You don't happen to remember the plan I outlined to you the day I set fire to your off -- uh, the day I was promoted?
I do remember and I was impressed. Anyway, that's all forgotten now. Driver!
Relax, Norville. It's only natural in a period of transition for the more nervous element to run for cover.
Okay, Sid. Like I said, you're the expert, but --
Maybe.
Say, sounds more like a guy I ought to marry. What's his name?
About what?
Well --
-- worried?
I'm just --
To be what?
I don't know. I want it to be --
What about it?
The day after tomorrow?
No, it's not --
Is there something I've said that's caused this contempt? Or is it just the things I stand for that you despise?
Mr. Robinson?
Do you have a special grudge against me? Do you feel a particularly strong resentment for me?
It was nothing to do with you, sir.
He does, does he? How did I treat you -- like a water buffalo?
She's a very groovy girl. That's the problem.
Snoopy. Christ, I thought he'd be brain dead by now.
He isn't fighting no more. Glenn told me the Snoop's been managing some guys up there now, works out at the Kronk.
First thing we do, we get to Detroit, we find Glenn, then we find a window to throw him out of.
I been thinkin', if I was Glenn, I was up there to take down the Ripper, where would I go?
Well, first off, if you were Glenn, you wouldn't be thinking.
Remember Snoopy Miller, his old pal from Lompoc?
Do you know him well?
Fine. Send it right away. I don't want him to fire Arthur.
He was the last baby my father delivered, Arthur was.
I think you ought to give this matter some thought, Mr. Deeds.
Well, your uncle was Chairman of the Board of Directors. They probably expect you to carry on.
No. Miss Lawson came in here voluntarily to answer your questions. She doesn't have to sit here and be insulted. So, either you charge her now or we're leaving.
Thanks Oh, did you send that telegram to Jim Mason?
Jim Mason? Oh, yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't send it. I've got it written out, though. Here it is. "Arthur's been with the Tallow Works too long. STOP. Don't think we should fire him. Longfellow."
Huh?
I mean, about the Power of Attorney.
They're getting married?
Wow, was it a decoder ring?
I'm tired of running away. Besides, we past this place two times already. We're not getting nowhere.
Why are you running away?
So now you'll have a mother.
No, you smiled.
Yeah, you don't remember?
I don't know. My fax said "have a good fright".
Look, I'm not saying you'd be able to do it without some hard work...
Wow. It must be great being you. You got it all.
Everyone needs something.
Oh man, you're serious... This man thinks I need to be saved!
Wait a minute, wait a minute... you're tryin' to save me?
I mean there must be programs out there, opportunities...
I've got everything I need.
You just said everyone needs something.
Me?
Yeah? What do you need?
Who shot who in the Embarcadero in August, 1879.
Good morning, Private James. Please come in. I should like you to meet my uncle, Herr Minister of Police Galgenstein.
It's me.
But she wanted more out of life, right?
Good, you start tomorrow.
Yeah.
Either you're European or badly brought up.
We have to show in court that, without a doubt, a successful man, an important figure in the Hollywood community, is also dealing cocaine.
Like gang-busters. Now, remember, if you don't want to go to jail, we gotta put your boss in jail.
Tell the folks where you are today, Donald.
I did.
Mr. Sheldrake, I've got good news for you --
Hit by a swinging door? Or maybe a Yellow Cab?
That guy really must've belted him.
Hi, Buddy-boy. What happened to you?
You here all by yourself?
Yeah, he's punchy. Talking to himself.
Oh Jesus.
Fine. Absolutely. Must be disappointing though. Must come as a hell of a shock.
So uh...
So, uh, Alexei, which I know isn't his name...
Fine.
Look who says bum!
You are.
Yeah. Listen ... come out to the house tomorrow, will ya?
I think you'll find it normal enough.
It is.
Robbed. He was angry.
In fifteen minutes I can teach you everything you need to know to dine with the Queen. First, as you pick up the knife you shift your fork to the left hand.
When word gets out that Zenovitch was a cop, all hell will break lose. You've got 24 hours. That's all I can give you. 24 hours on your own. After that the case and the witness go back to the Homicide Department.
I'm just worried maybe I'm not old enough for you.
That bastard Pucinski...
Yeah... The one that introduced Santos to you and Clyde.
All I have to do is grab my suitcase, and I'm ready. You're lucky cause I happen to love night drivin'.
Did I tell ya it's great to see ya again?
Send Oona up above the tree tops. She be our eyes.
How do we follow a raven we can't even see?
That's right.
Good. Good. Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the "Bread Instead of Bullets Club" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935. A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it?
Yes.
I am Inspector Edouard Grandpierre of the Police Judiciaire. Would you be so kind as to come with me, please?
No point fixin' it!
No, we're from San Diego. Why?
I bet you that chick is two tons of fun. You know, the grateful type.
Hey, do you guys ever... feel like you don't belong here...?
Oh, Christ. Don't tell me you've changed your mind. I already sent 'em a check.
Just stay calm, use your head. It'll be all right. Just the Same, though... Guess you better swear me in.
Of course, they have the same chance. They can look at me like a bug under glass, if they want to.
Huh?
I think I'll start reviving it tomorrow, with say -- Miss Torso for a start?
We see it. For the record, it reads "Lucille Angstrom." What's the point of this?
I haven't had a bingo partner in ages.
Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there.
Yes, better get me a half. All I can afford.
If you want to see us you must come later.
I'm not so bad.
A what?
Oh.
Well, yes, that's perfect. Well done.
Wouldn't want that... Okay -- just one more.
Yes -- she might think you don't have true love on your mind.
No.
Come on, I'm trying to help here.
I'm gonna clean it up.
And I thought we were getting on so well.
I mean it. From what I can tell, we re a mom and pop operation, we re already over-extended in sales, and any price advantage we could offer would easily be matched by a larger supplier...
Oh yeah... 1'm fine...
Listen, don't take this the wrong way but, I'm wondering if this is such a good idea.
We're not upset with you, Dave. We think you did a terrific job. Don't we?
I uh... I had lunch in town today. Happened to cross paths with "that Redfield woman." I apologize. I thought you were half-joking about that.
Look, I'm sorry. I know you said not to talk, but when I saw the crowd I just got excited...
I now know more about their affair than I remember about my marriage. Francesca, the last thing I want to do is put you in any kind of situation that would... even though we know it's just -- I mean, it's nothing like that, but if anybody saw us or...
Extend things?
S'long.
Charlie, boy, you better give me that money. C'mon now, give it to me. It's mine.
I think you know I'm serious. I'll pay you if you like... but I'd like to see you.
What are you trying to do, Eddie? You beat him. You beat him bad. You wanna kill yourself?
She was wearing a white dress with a cute, black hat-- and carrying a bag with S. M. on it. Funny--her name's not on the passenger list.
Padua girls. One tall, decent body. The other one kinda short and undersexed?
You have a car? So... I don't understand why... if you have a car, so then-then wh-why did you say "Do you have a car?"... like you wanted a lift?
Yeah, well, what can I say? Dad must've had forty pounds on me. Jesus, you remember him being this big?
Not at all. Lot of potatoes!
Me?
Sorry, sorry...
Nona, don't start bitching. I got maybe two years left to play. I'm just trying to put some things together for us.
We still have to go?
Jane, I'm not some chore you have to finish so you can stay on schedule.
I guess so.
You think I stink, don't you? You think I stink for what I told you?
Okay. Come on. Put 'em up!
Very graceful. Perfect form.
Would you say she was ambitious?
Terrence and I came down here to do serious work. For centuries these tunnels have been home to subcultures mainstream society would not tolerate.
Yeah?
The cops. It's their backward laws that force all this underground in the first place, endangering people whose only crime is pushing the limits of perception, exploring new states of psychic awareness.
You think it's silly. But do you realize that young man is actually in a deep sleep?
Psychic awareness. Right.
He's on a new drug called ZBH, or "Daydream". It allows the user to be fully alert and mobile while he's dreaming. He is literally conscious and unconscious at the same time.
What?
Andy...
Yeah well, that's like really groovy and everything, but who hacked my uncle's legs off?
Hi. He should book now because we can get an excursion fare. Jessica's parents are travel agents and --
That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
What do you think it's like?
Do you remember her?
But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
Heaven.
Maybe I jumped the gun. Maybe Those Cowboys aren't near as bad As they're painted. You know I Was thinkin', there's a lot of Money in the cattle business...
Hmmm. I'd be surprised if you could.
Oh indeed?
You are the one, Wyatt. You sure are.
That's right.
George Bailey.
I want you to take a good look at that face.
Wait a minute, you thinkin' of Getting in bed with the Cowboys?
I know the rogue, Jack. Tis Jimmy Squarefoot.
Of course--but-- There's your cue--hurry up--
"Soveriegn princess of his captive heart what dire affliction has thou made me suffer, thus banished from thy presence with reproach, and fettered by thy rigorous command, not to appear again before thy beautiful face. Deign princess, to remember this thy faithful slave, who now endures such misery for love of thee"....
Nay. This time we strike first!
He's history.
Yes...
That was cool, wasn't it? You know, I don't even know where that came from. I just opened my mouth and it came out. After I said it I thought, that's a cool line, I gotta remember that.
Now what could he sell at three in the morning?
He was taking something out of the apartment. I'm certain.
Sometimes it's worse to stay than it is to run.
No. The shades are still drawn in their apartment.
Yes, my lord.
Jeanne, this is -- in fact -- my loyal friend and finest archer, Jean d'Aulon. Jean... I place her in your care. Find her suitable lodgings -- here -- in the castle... and guard her with your life.
He implied it.
That's the kind of stuff they want!
Oh, Bruce, let me see that money Hildy gave you.
The money? Why?
There's a lot of counterfeit big bills going around.
I'll find her, Bruce, if I have to put every detective in the city on the job. Tell you what -- go over to the Missing Persons Bureau and describe your mother. What does she look like?
She's -- well, she's very motherly. That's about the best description I know.
That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
They done that too long in my family.
Where else am I gonna go. Bet three grand on Rocky.
You might not have a choice.
They put a gun on you, you'll go back.
Hi.
Well, I'm a puppeteer...
No, wait! I like your tits. I love your tits. I want to fuck you.
I mean, I am really attracted to you.
I m not a homosexual. I just like women for more than their bodies. I guess you could say I'm the new American male.
Here it is! According to the old will Joanne Braslow was to inherit two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
What would Joanne Braslow need with an estate attorney? She wasn't even mentioned in Marsh's will.
Joe Koehler. I know him. He's an estate attorney -- and he's very expensive.
I was thinking that when the trial is over we'd all go skiing for a weekend.
She kills the old man and makes it look like Miss Lawson did it. Pretty slick.
Under the law a person cannot profit from their own wrong doing. Since Rebecca Lawson is the sole beneficiary of the new will, if she is found guilty the will is void and Joanne Braslow could make a very good case to have the old will reinstated.
What good does that do -- it's the old will?
Awwww, buddy --
Yeah.
Play a song then
I told everyone seven-fifteen. Didn't I? Seven-fifteen.
She'll get here.
Where the hell is she?
It's early.
Ever go to church?
Well, let's get your first prom under the belt, okay?
But, buddy, you were --
Just like the day of the auditions, right? Jesus. How's my hair?
Awe inspiring.
Wuddya mean, buddy?
Concerned. I'm just the hall monitor here.
It's not only financial assistance. What he's got to do is go to Baltimore tomorrow and ask his parents for money. It's not going to happen on the phone.
About a dog.
Think white and get serious.
Take my car -- a convertible. Do you drive?
Yeah. If his parents are alive they've got to help -- those are the rules. Good.
Yes. And tomorrow? I have a high maintenance selling painter coming through... So I'm out. Can you take him?
Like the wind but I'm not doing it.
You learned 900 languages in five minutes?!
Let's face it. You want me.
I moving more to Communism now it's dying out.
DAMN HIM! I knew mama wouldn't have thought of that herself. It was some damn perverted... photographic mind influencing her! When did the bastard die?
Yeah, this place is great.
Right before his un-American thing.
Hey.
Well, I used to live there. I used to live there for years. You know, but it's gotten-it's so dirty now.
Yeah, I love it there.
Uh, you guys are still-uh, you're still New Yorkers.
Well, I flew single-engine fighters in the Air Force, but this plane has four engines. It's an entirely different kind of flying...all together!!!
Surely you can't be serious.
Wait a minute. You re my wife?
Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
Guess I'm not used to so much.
Why, then is my pump well flowered.
Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
I thought you were incredible in there. I know how much I have to learn. I'd really -- a lot -- appreciate it...if...
I'm gonna go look at it again.
I'm sorry if I was in the way. It was totally impressive. Great piece.
I can't believe I'm really here. No kidding. If you're through work now --
I saw the smile -- good piece.
I'm different.
How about anything, anything you want to do.
What's he saying now?
A date... Coffee... A drink...A walk in the park.
Here's goodly gear!
All right, then. It's your secret.
On your property?
That's it. My client doesn't have to take this crap from you.
What?
It is, unless you're a fuck up, like myself.
I'm what you would call a fifth year senior.
Outstanding.
How are things down under? Blossoming I hope.
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
Robert! Jesus! I'll kill him.
Seven it is.
You think we look like we re trying too hard.
...Oh, yeah, I bought the whole kit -- Yeah, ya sold me the turtles, the bowl, an' the mountain -- I had to get rid of the mountain 'cause they kept fallin' off.
I had it pulled. People callin' all the time. Who needs it -- Who'd you wanna call?
Would ya like a glass of water?
Not interested.
Oh, that's quite all right. No charge.
I don't know.
Are you under the impression that now I'm in some way obligated to you?
That was Cassius!
Let him have his say out.
How'd it go?
No, I'm fine... really...
Let's make it at eight.
Mary's a babe!
What?
A convention? How'd you see her at a convention?
Mary.
My Mary -- she's not in Japan, she's single, and she's got no rugrats. She does have a little gambling problem, she plays the football cards a bit too much, but she's a babe, a surgeon babe!
Huh? But why did Healy?
Who's the guy she's gonna marry?
