I got a good feeling about this one, kid.
How many does this make?
Lucky thirty-three!
Oh, so this is where they keep the light.  6. 
Must be the altitude.
Aren't I a little old to be introduced as your boyfriend?
Sounds like a dog.
I can build you a better closet.
I got it.  8. 
The creatures are ready. Just gonna sit there?
Here. Husk and think.  15. 
Why? You love your place.
But what?
You write there. It's your office.
It is ours. I bought it for us.
What's going to happen?
Did you want to get married?  16. 
Well, Mr. Bradshaw, what if it was an option?
And you know what happens when people assume. They make an ass out of who?
What do you think, kid?
Well, I wouldn't mind be married to you. Would you mind being married to me?
I want you. So. Okay.
We're getting married. Should we get you a diamond?
Deal.
Geese, Miranda -- relax. Magda's not even finished yet.
He woke me up too.
I am not. You want to go through life with foam on your lip and no one telling you?
Wait --- wait -- Don't come already...
Wait, wait -- get on top. Get on --  24. 
We never have sex and you want to get it over with?
When was the last time we had sex?
Are you the last person in New York still taking out library books?  28. 
That's an old one.
Am I in there?
You need to get glasses.
Typical short guy. Gives it all away up front.
What's it about?
Interesting. What happens?
Bring it, Ludwig.
Good stuff.
Does a love fax count?
I'm pretty sure my secretary sent one at some point.
Alright. Here's a love letter from me to you.
Again?
Do we have to make that big of a deal?
It's just -- I've already had two big weddings.
I don't know -- a judge, couple friends and then we go for ham and eggs after.
Would we have to whisper? In the library?  32. 
Yep -- At the New York Public Library.
Who would put that in there?
Okay. Open them.
Like it?
-- I had sex with someone else.  43. 
Peanut butter it is.
Miranda, it's still me.
Not now -- I just got an email from the the contractor -- they pushed our move-in date again -- and I have to --
Two hundred? Jesus, Carrie -- it's gone up again?
You said: seventy-five people in a partitioned-off room.
Change the dress.
Up, up. I have to finish this. Up.
I don't have time for this.
No, I'm not -- It's a circus! Two hundred people -- Page Six -- This is my third marriage -- how do you think it makes me look?
You wanted all this.
I want you, Carrie. That's what I want. I would have just gone down to city hall.
Well, no. I wasn't suggesting -- I was just saying.
Karl... a partner at the firm.
Quite a toast, Samantha.  51. 
I don't want to bother you all --
You're not bothering us.
But --- I need to talk to Miranda. Samantha, could you -- ask her to come out. I don't want to go in. It's a party and all.
You didn't leave me any choice. You won't return my calls -- You only talk to me in front of the baby when you know I can't say anything.
Miranda, please... It was just that one time. Please -- I love you --
Hey. Are you alright?
Don't go. Spend the night with me.
I'm just tired -- I guess.
It's me.
Hey -- I need to talk.
It's just -- everything is great as it is. I don't want to screw it up.  56. 
I screwed it up twice before.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know what to do?  57. 
Okay. Good night.
Can you put Carrie on, please?
Hello?
Why aren't you calling me back? I really need to talk to you. Call me back as soon as you get this.
I'm out front -- waiting. I can't go in without you.
I've been calling you for an hour. Why haven't you been answering your phone?  62. 
I was out front --but I just left. I can't do this.
What the fuck am I doing? What the fuck am I doing? Turn around and go back.
By the time we go around the block she'll be gone. No one's behind us - - Turn around!
Pull over. Pull over.
I freaked out for a minute -- but -- I'm ready now --
I'm sorry -- I just --
Carrie, wait --
You all ready to go, B-boy?
Aw man -- Gotta have the new Batman.
You got plans with the girls?
Would you like to come and eat with us? We can go somewhere over here on your side.
Miranda -- I never meant to hurt you.  105B. 
Put your hat on. It's snowing out.
Miranda, I know I made it hard for you to trust me. But -- You made it hard for me to trust you.
The way you treated me and cut me out of your life like that? I mean, yeah -- I broke a vow. But what about the other vows? Like promising to love someone for better or for worse? What about that?
Charlotte. Charlotte wait --
My car's right there. Get in my car.
Charlotte -- we need to get you to the hospital -- Please get in my car. It's right here and ready.
I was going to get these to you. I didn't want it to be a total loss.
I guess we were afraid it meant something if we didn't.
Is there a funny part?
Yep. The jokes on us.
Thanks.
I'd like to think I was that smooth.
And the way we decided to get married -- All business... No romance. That's not the way you propose to someone.
Ever thine. Ever mine. Ever ours.
You okay that it was just us?
Still. Would have been nice if you had the girls here.
Which is why I called them.
