Most people are just talkers . All they got is talk . But when all ' s said and done , it is the doers who change the world . And when they do that , they change us . That ' s why we never forget them ... So , which one are you ? Do you just talk about it ? Or do you stand up and do something about it ? Because believe you me all the rest of it is just coffee house bullshit .
Looks like a storm ' s comin '.
Aye .
Peace , they say , is the enemy of memory . So it had been for my boys .
For some time now , their past had felt like a dream to them ... faded and worn .
And then suddenly , as if not a day had passed ... it was back . I could see it in their eyes .
I could feel it , heavy in their presence . Something calling them back .
" And they cried out , How long O ' Lord dost thou not judge and revenge our blood upon them that dwell on the earth ?"
And God said , " All will fear the wrath of the lamb . For the great day of their reckoning hath come ."
" And they that holdest my name shall come with the shaking of the earth and the roiling of the oceans ."
Something ' s happened .
The priest . Did they release his name ?
No . But I made a few calls , still got some friends in the diocese there . McKinney . Father Douglas McKinney .
You knew him ?
Knew of him . Everybody did . A regular Mother Theresa . Youth hostels , soup kitchens . Even made it into the newspapers sometimes .
Listen boys . I think it ' s best that ya just stay put and we ' ll try ta figure out what ...
We need to keep our heads , here . It ' s probably not even them .
Of course it ain ' t them but that doesn ' t really matter , does it . Our skeletons just came screaming out of the closet . We ' re fucked .
We ' re not fucked .
We are totally fucked !
... and not just fucked , like elephant dick , pounded in the ass , no reach around , jungle fucked !
Now ' s not the time to panic , Green beans !
Oh , I disagree . Now ' s the perfect time to panic . We ' re all Accessories to ...
Don ' t you fucking say it !
I didn ' t even know he had a protege . What is this bullshit ?
Special Agent Eunice Bloom , 32 years old . Smecker plucked her right out of class at Quantico .
Smecker hand picked her ? Aw , man . This brawd ' s gonna be a nightmare .
She was assigned to OCD two years back . She can shoot a gun , set three course records during her training .
Great . A bull dike , Annie Oakley wanna - be . We gotta get rid of her .
She is also an authority on the Saints case . Which means Smecker must have walked her through it .
And the hits just keep on comin '.
Naw ... I ' m in no condition . I ' d just slow ' em down .
Well , are ya at least gonna try ta talk them out of this ?
We don ' t even know what this is yet ! Somebody could just be tryin ' ta get away with murder here !
Aye . Only there ' s about a thousand easier ways ta do that . Trust me . Someone ' s callin ' them out , Sibeal . Ya kill a priest in a church and make it look like they did it . Bring ' em back with a vengeance . Don ' t know who . Don ' t know why . But someone thinks he ' s real fuckin ' clever . Only one problem with his little plan .
What ' s dat ?
It worked .
Jesus Christ ! D ' er ' s too much we don ' t know and if you ' re won ' t at least try ta talk some sense into them , I will !
Exactly what do you intend to do ?
Every last motherfucker that had anything to do with it .
Game time . How are we playing this ?
Feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine . We hard line her . Stick together on this . Agreed ?
Agreed . We ' re a brick wall .
Let ' s rock this bitch .
T ' sup ... I mean , what ? Yeah , well , funny as in ha ha , though not like funny as in gay cuz ... I ' m not ... played high school football .
Look , with all due respect , Agent Bloom ...
Excuse me ?
O ' kay , Eunice . I don ' t see why the fuck the Fed is ...
What is the Fed ' s interest in this ? The detectives harden , brick wall . Eunice furrows her brow .
The victim was killed late last night . When people gathered for morning mass , they found the front entrance chained and padlocked . A locksmith came out , cut the chain and surprise , surprise . Cell phones . Half of them called the cops . Half of them called the media . But regardless ... word ' s out .
What ? No , yeah , no . Of course .
Do you want a cup of coffee or something ?
The two " V ' s ." The victim and venue don ' t add up .
All their vics were criminals . Clearly not the case here . So , it wasn ' t them which means this is a local matter and it falls under our jurisdiction . No need for Federal involvement so with all due respect ... we ' ll see you later , Special Agent Bloom .
Uh , so ... let ' s just ... what can you tell us about the shooters ?
One guy , lefty , short . Got it .
David . You can call me David .
... one guy ' s holding two guns to the back of your head .
Left handed .
But you said he was wicked short .
That puts him at five , seven - ish . That ' s not uncommonly short .
That ' s wicked short .
Why are his hands chained ?
But he can ' t hit him back .
This guy ' s fuckin ' crazy . The brothers whip out money and give it to the Sailor .
You should never fight a Mexican , Frenchy . Pound for pound , the toughest mother fuckers on earth . Know why ? We like pain . We like it , Pierre . I mean think about it , " tabasco sauce ." What kinda fucked up people would even invent that shit ?
Don ' t be scared . Remember , I can ' t hit you . I ain ' t gonna hit ya . Ain ' t gonna hit ya . Ain ' t gonna ...
Ooooo . Found the loophole , bitch !
Aughtta be a lawyer ! Got the ' fine print on y ' ass ! Pursuant to ! Pro bono ! Pari Pasu ! I ' ll knock you out on contingency , mother fucker .
Oh , shit . FIRE ! FIRE ! The brothers emerge from the shadows , cutting them off .
Whoa ! Uh , merci , uh , si vous plait .
Just protectin ' our investment . Ya made us fifty bucks .
Oh , thank , God . Irish , huh ? Finally some class . I ' m Romeo .
Connor .
Murphy . Why were you yellin ' " fire "?
I heard you were supposed to on t . v .
That ' s if you ' re gettin ' raped .
Oh ... I ' d be more inclined to go with something like , " THAT DOESN ' T GO THERE ,
We saved your entire fucking country in World War Two ! Gee ... thanks for the statue !
So , there it is . I want everyone to feel free to share their thoughts .
Six years ago , with the backing of an adoring public , these vigilante fucks put my father on his knees and executed him ... in public . Mi Patrigno , a blood relative and benefactor to all of you . Poppa Joe made you rich and his murder remains un - revenged ...
Thank you , Doctor Phil . So , let ' s take a moment to look at the serendiplious , diperous , serendip ...
The prodigal son , huh ? He wants us , he ' s fuckin ' got us .
But why would he do something so public ?
Think about it . People figure we did it . Makes it more likely someone will drop a dime . Way easier to get to us in prison , isn ' t it , now .
But how would anyone recognize us ?
You don ' t remember those sketches on the news channel ?
Shit . That ' s right . Y ' know , every time they show those composites on TV and then they catch the guy , it looks nothin ' like him . But ours ?
Just our luck . We get Leonardo fuckin ' Divinci as a sketch artist .
Maybe we should dye our hair .
What ?
Yeah . These guys are always dyin ' their hair . You know , like in " The Fugitive ." It ' s covert and shit .
What color would you dye it ?
I don ' t know ... lighter , I guess .
Y ' mean ... blonde ?
I didn ' t say that !
California , surfer boy , gay , gay blonde ?!
I ' m warnin ' ya !
Just keep your hands off my ass back there and , " stay gold , Pony Boy ."
Fuck you !
AAAAAH ! Connor bolts up , knocking over the pot . Hot water and pennies spread across the floor . Connor pulls the pen out .
Serves ya right !
Oh , shit .
I know who you are . You guys are the fuckin '....
SHUT IT ! Murphy moves behind Romeo , shuts the door and shoves him in .
Oh , this is so fucking cool , man . I ' m from Boston . I love you guys . Shit , everybody does ! I mean , holy fucking shit ! Maybe I could get in on this , you know ? Bring some La Raza ta this thing . Spice it up a little . Hey , is it true you guys say a prayer before you grease somebody ?
And an awesome wailing was heard throughout heaven ...
... as the terrible hand of the Lord struck upon the earth .
And as Almighty God created you ... he now calleth you home .
Let ' s have a shot while we ' re waitin '.
That shit was NOT funny , man !
Oh , thank you , Jesus . Thought I greased my drawers .
No .
But I got conex all over Bean Town . Romeo ' ll hook you up like a tow truck !
No .
Why not ?!
We don ' t hafta give you reasons . Forget it .
It ' s because I ' m Mexican , isn ' t it !
How dare you , sir , insinuate such a thing ? The fact that you ' re a greasy spic ' s got nothin ' ta do with it .
I ' m gonna let you have that one . Look . I can do this . It ' s not rocket science . You two find bad guys doing bad shit and you kill them , right ?
It ' s not that simple .
Yes it is .
S ' pose you ' re right . I ' d sorta hoped we were a little more artistic than that .
Well , you ain ' t . Can ' t you guys see it ? This shit ' s fate , man . Like preordained type shit . Mea fucking Culpa ! Why do you think you just happened to be in that hatchway today ?
Oh , don ' t start gettin ' all super fuckin ' natural on us . We saw those guys goin ' in there !
Ah , ha ! That ' s what you say . I say it ' s because Jeeeeesus wanted it that way !
Oh , no .
Fine . Then what exactly do you intend to do when you hit U . S . soil ?
We ' ll go after all Yakavetta ' s people and operations till we get to the man himself .
Yeah , work our way up the food chain .
So , what ' s your first gig ? What ' s the first thing you gonna do ?
Well , I don ' t suppose we have a succinct plan , y ' know , per se .
Yeah . It ' s not fully developed yet , y ' know , as it were .
You two need to chill in the green room , sip on some Pellegrinos and let your manager handle the details . And you better get my Cub Scout badge ready . Cuz if you want to kick Yakavetta in the nuts , let him know you ' re in town ... Romeo ' s got an ace in the hole for you .
To have them executed . Revenge . Oldest motive in the book .
The Saints killed his daddy six years ago , right ? He was inside when that happened doing a nickel for extortion .
Yeah . From inside he could only do so much . Since he got out nine months ago , the Yakavetta ' s have regained their original strength . Looks like their clearing all their open accounts .
C . I .' s came back . Cold hits all around . Concezio Yakavetta and his six Capo Regime , all blood relatives , have disappeared .
So , it fits . He ' s gone to the mattresses with his top brass . He ' s protecting them till this is over .
That means his resources on the streets are battening down the hatches , waiting for them to show .
This is not good . She ' s gunning for the boys hard .
This brawd , trying to put a feather in her cap is gonna get us locked up .
Just calm down .
And you know they ' ll send us to the Hoag . We put half those deranged sex freaks in there . I hope you guys like cock sandwiches . Cuz we ' ll be eating them for breakfast , lunch and dinner !
We need to figure what we ' re gonna do when the boys show and start doin ' what they do best . Cuz that ' s when the shit ' s really gonna hit the fan .
That ' s another thing . Everyone ' s assuming that they ' re going to come back . I mean , we got no way of knowing that for sure .
Yeah . That could totally happen . They could not come back .
What dream world did you two just slip into ?!
It ' s been all over the papers the last two years . Yakavetta ' s in bed with the Chinese . They ' re using international shipping routes to smuggle it in . This is Little Yaka ' s shit .
Let ' s follow ' em down the rabbit hole , Alice .
You just scored a few points , Rome .
Well , dust off my " Members Only " jacket . Cuz the kid has also supplied the ride !
I thought you said your car was inconspicuous .
I don ' t like words that got ' spic ' right in the middle . Besides , it is ... where I live .
Where ' s that ? Pimpville ?
Hey ! I hail from a colorful people . Besides , you wouldn ' t know style if it pitched a tent in your ass ! What do you think of the ride , Conman ?
The only way I could be more embarrassed right now is if I was ridin ' a moped .
Yeah ... while fuckin ' a fat girl .
Yeah ... rollin ' through the gym at my high school reunion .
All right ! I get the fucking point !
O ' kay , here ' s the plan .
We skin out , go ta Doc ' s for a shot of Irish . We ' re home in time for tacos .
Well , it ' s ... uh ... you know , it ' s ...
It ' s genius . I can even drive an F - lift , man . Got my class " D " license and everything .
Now , dat ' s the spirit .
I need a gun .
What the fuck ? I ' m in on this shit , man ! I ' m working here !
You can consider yourself a fuckin ' pledge until we say different .
Can I consider myself your girlfriend , too ?
That ' s what you get . Is there a problem ?
It ' s fine .
Don ' t worry , Rome . Shit like this builds character .
Yeah , the character of a little bitch .
Now , dat ' s just unprofessional .
What do we think ?
I think Yakavetta murdered a good man just to send us a message .
Well ... let ' s send him one back .
Why ?
I don ' t know .
It ' s not them .
What do you think happened here ?
Sorry , man . We got a plan going , here . Technically , I was supposed to knock you out .
SCRAM ! DOCK WORKER You got it !
So , let ' s not let this one , small incident get in the way of ...
Shut up and get behind the fuckin ' wheel !
Well , at least the plan is off to a winning start .
Go fuck y ' rself .
How the fuck would you know ?
Fuck you . I know shit .
Jesus ! What the fuck ' s he doin '?!
He can ' t see where he ' s goin '!
Shit ! Tell him to go left , now !
Go left ! Go left !
What ?!
I can ' t fuckin ' believe I let you talk me into this ! This is a stupid plan !
I didn ' t notice you throwin ' out any ideas , ya creative asshole !
Fuck you !
Hey ! What ' s goin ' on in there ?!
Jesus Christ ! Tell him to stop !
BRAKES ! BRAKES ! BRAKES ! A few of the Chinese turn as Romeo slams on the brakes , screeching to a halt just before the well . The crate slides right off and falls in , disappears from sight . CRASH !
Just got a call from my best snitch . Never steered me wrong . He says its this guy . " Gorgeous " George Tuffano . He ' s trusted bruglione to Yakavetta but not blood . He ' s been left control of the streets . He ' s running all of it .
They call him " Gorgeous " cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry . He ' s even got the ' out of season ' fake bake going on , a real peacock , this guy .
Ballistics just dug it out .
Yeah , or like bringing a really small gun ... to a gunfight .
I don ' t know . Ballistics is reading three shooters . This is one of them .
Maybe we ' re reading it wrong . The priest was a frame job , right ?
Yeah , maybe somebody ' s trying to eliminate some competition here .
Fine , they ' re back . What ' s the plan ?
Holy ... fucking ... shit .
BOYS ! The brothers and Doc hug and greet as he ushers them in with Romeo in tow . The bar is closed , empty .
Sound as an Irish pound , Doc .
Is it too late for a shot ?
Oh , the Lord told me you ' d be comin ! He said , " Doc , they ' re comin " and I was ta get everting ready . So I did . Everting ' s ruh , ruh , ruh , it ' s all set .
Uh , hem !
Oh , this is our Mexican .
How are ya , lad ? They call me ... FUCK !... ASS !
Nice to meet you , Fuck Ass , I ' m Romeo .
The place used ta be an old speak easy in the forties . I only use it for storage , now .
This is so fucking cool .
Nobody even knows it ' s up here . You ' ll be safe .
You know what this is ? This is our hide out , man ! We got a hide out !
What are you , fucking five years old ?
Hey , Rome , we got sheets and broomsticks . You could build yourself a fort .
Fuck the both of you !
Not this time , ya little shit .
We ' ll see , old man .
FUCK ! ... me up the ...
ASS ! The boys and Romeo burst into hysterics . Doc rages .
Whew . A quarter of a mill for us ?
Uncle , why do you have to disrespect me in front of them ?!
Well , I don ' t wash fucking pots anymore ! I ' m part of this , Uncle !
He ' s in . All the way in .
Mucho corazon .
Hey , uh , maybe we should ...
Shut up . Romeo ' s crying .
You fucking assholes !
Get over here !
Push the talk button , numb nuts .
I can hear you fine , Smokey and the Bandit . Now , what the fuck are you doing here ?
You stupid motherfucker ! I told you , you ' re on the streets till this is over ! Now get the fuck outta here !
Tap ' s up and running on George ' s cell .
Rosary bead . They found it pushed into the carpet near the victim . Father McKinney wasn ' t wearing a rosary so it ' s probably been there a while . Duffy comes in with a stack of papers . He heaves it down .
The results on all 864 prints found at the scene . All match churchgoers or clergy but one . The partial on the priest ' s watch is still unidentified .
It ' s a brick wall anyway . We know Napoleon was wearing gloves . Lab got zilch off the chain and lock . The pennies came up clean too .
Aw , man . Daddy would knock that out like Mike Tyson .
What ?! I didn ' t say nothing !
Right here , off his left elbow . Where are you going with this ?
What the ... did they use his mug shot ?
What ? No .
You remember how he told us he was embarrassed cuz the guy had to hold up all his long hair behind his head ?
Aye .
Look at that .
That ' s an arm .
Oh ... that ' s fuckin ' harsh .
Y ' er one of a kind , Roc .
So , am I as good as this guy , or what ?
You , sir , are no David Della Rocco .
We ' re developin ' quite the cult following in the old neighborhood .
Que pasa .
We got him .
How would you like me to sidekick you in the ass , Roy ?
Let ' s go .
I ' m sick of this shit ! I ' ve been breaking my balls , here and I get second banana billing ! I ...
I , I , I . There is no " I " in team , ya selfish prick .
Yeah ?! Well , there ' s an " I " in " Fuck you !
Lovely voice . We ' d like ya ta sing for us . What do ya say ? George struggles and nods . Murphy hops off . George spills out , hot pink Speedos . On all fours and breathing heavy ...
We want the shooter you motherfuckers used on that priest .
Where ' s Yakavetta hidin '?
You meeting someone tonight , George ?
The what ?
What ' s this ?
My Uncle ' s place is closed tonight . I got the key .
It ' s down by the docks . Dead as a doornail at night .
Yeah . You could set off fourth of July fireworks in dat place and nobody would hear . How ' s Mexican for you , George ?
Hey , DMV came up dry on the partial . INTERpol ' s still working it . Should only be another couple of hours .
Yeah . Nothing big . We just dumped a text message from George ' s cell . Just two words . " El Cava ." It ' s a Mexican joint down by the docks . He sent it to his enforcer , Jo Jo Rhama . Guess gangsters gotta eat too , huh ?
You need a body guard ?
Bye .
Oh , shit .
We ' ll see , won ' t we .
Si , muchachos .
These dagos are getting antsy and I ' m getting Spicaroo ' d and Pepe ' d . The kid ' s about to go Poncho fucking Villa out there !
Stick it out . Waitin ' on one more .
The gang ' s all here .
Gimme my fucking bee bee gun .
Naw . You ' ve earned your stripes , Rome .
It ' s Irish for " You ' re fucked ."
Viva La Mejico , bitches !
What do ya think ? Let him go ?
We ' ll let God decide if you get a second chance .
Now , that was , perhaps the finest example of spiritual guidance that I have ever had the good fortune ta witness .
Well , thank you very much . Mysterious ways . Mysterious ways .
He ' s gone .
Who are ya ?
We heard about Smecker . He was a good man .
Aye . You have our condolences .
Murphy .
Who the fuck was that guy ?!
Fucking ... what the fuck ?! Who the fuck is this brawd ?! And what the fuck ' s going on , here ?!
Oh , no you didn ' t .
Dolly , Duffy and Greenly ?
How are the lads ?
Bet ' cha I can guess which one .
What ' s that ?
INTERpol came through .
You were right . Five foot five . Gotta be the shooter .
That ain ' t all . Short stuff ' s work visa was signed by a sponsor that doesn ' t exist and look at the date . Two months after Nine Eleven .
Yakavetta ' s just a gangster . He ain ' t got the juice to pull that off .
INS red flagged it like a motherfucker . It ' s a shit storm .
What is this ? Where are we going ?
It ' s after hours . I mean , if you wanted a drink then ...
You knew all along .
What ? Ya don ' t call . Ya don ' t write .
I ' m glad we got the band back together ... ... even though our new bass player ' s kind of a retard .
So , where ' d you learn ta shoot like that ?
Guess that makes you a cowgirl , eh ? Thanks . Saved our asses .
This is the guy ?
Five , five ? He ' s short bastard isn ' t he ?
We ' re hittin ' him tomorrow night . Dat soon enough ?
The Pru .
The Prudential Building ? What are you , cracked ?
Why don ' t you just do it on center ice at a fucking Bruin ' s game ?!
Dat ' s where the man is so dat ' s where we ' re goin '. No guts no glory , Green Beans .
In fact , we could use a few extra hands ... that is if you fellas can still get yer Irish on .
Hey , I got balls for days , pally . I ' m a fucking sack - o - matic .
Y ' sure you don ' t wanna hear the plan ? I ' m not tryin ' ta brag or nothin ' but this one ' s a real Picasso .
Aw , Jesus .
Hey .
What is it ?
That is ... interestin '.
You think maybe we got another fox in the hen house here ?
I feel like that kid who found the gold ticket in the candy bar in " Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory ."
Yeah ... Charlie . And I want an Oompa Loompa now , Daddy , now .
I ' ll take these .
Have you been crying again ?
Yeah ! Tears of joy ! How much ?
Let ' s see .
What ?
Nothin '.
Are you saying I look gay ?!
No . You just hail from a colorful ...
You don ' t know me . You think these make me look gay ? Romeo poses . The Dealer shrugs .
That wiley old fox not as clever as we thought . Or maybe he played me from the git . Y - you think he played me ?
A little sensitivity , huh ? You heartless cocksucker ! I need to vindicate my feelings here ! I can ' t tell those goombas outside ! They ' ll serve up my balls over a plate of fucking spaghetti !
I want each of you to call your top button man . The best you got . I want them all here tonight . We rip this city a new asshole . It ' s time for us to reconnoiter our strength on the streets . We seize the day starting now ... Carpel Tunnel , gentlemen , Carpel Tunnel .
God speed . Romeo , in a laundry uniform , emerges from the back pushing a loaded laundry cart . He enters a ...
What .
Nothing .
Out with it ! What the hell ' s the matter with ya ?
Nothing ! It ' s just ... this is some heavy shit .
Ya did fine at your uncle ' s place .
Yeah , but we ' re going off a new script here . I ' m just having a ... period of adjustment .
You ' re about to have a period of gettin ' yer ass beat !
Hey ! You two ain ' t the only ones rollin ' with no health insurance ! Just let me do my thing . I ' m absorbing this .
This is not the time for you to be absorbin ' shit ! Now , if ya freeze up when you get in there just point yer gay guns at ' em and fer Christ sakes , at least try ta look cool !
I thought you were all hot fer dis !
Oh , I ' m hot ! I ' m fucking red hot ! The kid ' s flamin ' like Matt Damon in the Grande Camens !
This is you . Be on time .
I ' ll be there .
You ready fer dis shit , my dear brother ?
Let ' s do some gratuitous violence .
Come on . There ' s nothing to be afraid of . It ' s all over .
If the windows were shattered by gunfire coming from inside the room , the glass would have been blown outward . As you can see , most of it is on the inside .
Blood splatters in the direction of the rounds fired . If the assailants discharged toward the windows , the blood would follow suit . Here , the majority of splatter is in the opposing direction .
Trick question . There is no number three . He only fucked up twice .
Desperate times require ... some , you know , some desperate shit . Starting tonight , every one of you fat fucking slobs is back on the streets and earning your daily bread .
Each one of you is to stick to the guy that called you here like glue . You arm yourselves to the teeth , pick your own crews . These bible banging psychos will make an attempt . It ' s your job to blow their souless hearts out of their chests .
We gotta take back what ' s ours with some sincere ironfistery .
Creative ! It ' s a creative plan !
It ' s ridiculous ! Probably based on some stupid shit ya saw in a movie ! And here I am AGAIN all tyin ' myself up with rope ! What is the deal with you and rope ?! Honestly !
It happens ta be a useful thing !
You didn ' t get this from a movie ... did you ?
The " Eiger Sanction ," Clint Eastwood ! And it worked like a fucking charm for him !
O ' kay Lloyd Cranston of 135 Liberty Lane , apartment 3C . Lovely wife and kids . How old are they ? Nevermind . Here ' s the situation , Lloyd . Me and a couple of friends of mine are fittin ' to do some killin ' here tonight . I ' m talking bullets and blood , custom - wholesale slaughter . You following me , Lloyd - O ? Good . Now , I ' ve run into a little snag . I need to figure out a tag line . You know , something cool to say when it ' s all over like ..." I ' ll be back ," but mine , y ' know ? I need to own this one . I think this ' ll help me get through the quote , unquote event . I ' m going to take your gag off and you and me are going to riff a little , o ' kay ? Let ' s have fun with this .
Not riffing , Lloyd ! Now , I need an " Hasta La Vista " line , toute fucking suite and you ' re gonna help me think of one !
What the fuck ?
I don ' t know ! It just stopped !
Well , get it fuckin ' goin ' again !
It won ' t turn back on ! It just died !
How much time ?!
Sixty Seconds !
We gotta go now !
What are you talking about !?
If we ' re even a few seconds late , Romeo ' s dead ! We gotta go ! We ' re down thirteen stories !
Eleven more to go ! Ball park it !
The fuckin ' Eiger Sanction .
Not cool enough .
Too sacrilegious .
What are we at , a buffet , now ?
Hang on , you might be onto something with the buffet thing , like with food , y ' know ? Let ' s brainstorm on that idea for a minute .
TIME ?! JESUS CHRIST ! SEVEN SECONDS ... SIX ... FIVE ... INT . HALLWAY -- SAME TIME
" Who ordered the whup ass fajita !?"
What ?
Whup ass fajita ?
It ' s just ... I couldn ' t think ... I
Ding dong , motherfucker , diiiing dong !
Exactly .
You said it .
Should we ... clap or something ?
Shut up .
Eunice ! Oh , shit ! Eunice ! Greenly slams the talk button .
If you hurt her , you piece of shit , I will kill you ! Do you fucking hear , me ? I ' ll kill you !
Get a hostage negotiator down here and put some stank on it ! He could be in there all ... touching her and shit !
Did this little motherfucker ...?
Yeah , professional moron .
I got no idea . That ' s just weird . The Roman ? What do you think it means ?
What do we do now ? I mean , the brothers ain ' t goin ' nowhere until we get Panza or they do .
When ' s Romeo returnin ' to the " hide out ?'
Soon as he ' s done apologizin ' to his uncle for wreckin ' his restaurant .
And he should be sorry . The disrespect .
Hold your damn horses !
Sack - o - matic , I said !
I got nothin '!
One in the hole .
Boys !
Jesus Christ !
Doc ! Call da fuckin ' ambulance ! As they hold Greenly and beg him to hold on , we move to Poppa M standing over Crew Cut . Crew Cut looks up at him in awe .
Where is the Old Man ?
Just hold on .
Hang in there , brother . They ' re comin '.
Naw , boys ... it ' s over . Don ' t worry ... proudest day of my life .
Easy , boys .
What the fuck ' s he doin '?
I ' m gonna blow this mother fucker ' s brains out , right now !
CONNOR ! Connor stops . Poppa M holds out his free hand . Halt .
Where ?
I ' m so sorry , boys . This is all my fault .
What are ya talkin ' about , Da ?
I was an immigrant to the U . S . in 1958 . I was sixteen . I came to New York where my father , Jacob MacManus , was a cobbler .
Simple extortion ... protection money . But your grandfather was proud .
I just ... watched .
I buried my father , then I buried the men who killed him . Louie , my best friend , helped me ...
It started out slowly . Just the ones who were a threat to us .
Then one day ...
Then it began .
Louie would pick the marks and plan everything in detail .
And I would go in and do the jobs .
I would execute , over and over again , those who had taken my father from me .
So it went for years .
