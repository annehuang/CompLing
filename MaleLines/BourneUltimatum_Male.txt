Give me your gun and radio .
My argument is not with you .
So we got in the way ? Is that why Neski died ? Is that why you killed Marie ?
I told you people to leave me alone ! I fell off the grid . I was half way around the world .
She wouldn ' t want me to . That ' s the only reason your alive .
Who ' s " she ?"
A dirty section chief in league with a corrupt Russian Billionaire commits suicide when confronted by Jason Bourne . You couldn ' t make this stuff up . Abbot dead ) You watched this happen ?
Bourne ' s last confirmed location is Moscow , three days ago ?
So what does he do now ?
Like what ? What ' s he after ?
Pam , what I need to know is , what kind of a threat is he to us ?
Maybe he still will . Maybe he gave it to you because he wants to throw you in the opposite direction of his real plan . I don ' t know . I just know my number one rule is " the only way to stay safe is to assume the worst ." As far as I ' m concerned Bourne is a serious threat until proven otherwise . 6
... This one ' s three years ago -- had half of Interpol after him -- disappeared ... Turned up in Naples -- Berlin -- Moscow -- disappeared again ... The girl he was on he run with -- Marie Kreutz -- she turned up dead halfway around the world , from a sniper ' s bullet ... What connects the dots ? Is it Treadstone ?
Turn off that tape recorder .
She ' s dead . She was killed .
I didn ' t believe that .
She was shot . A man came for me .
Someone started all this ... and I ' m going to find them .
Who started Treadstone ?
Just tell me what I want to know !
You know something . Tell me where to start looking .
They give me the name I want , or I burn their entire house down to get it .
... This is big -- a skein of lies -- you pull at it and it just keeps coming -- I ' ll fill you in when I get home . And it ' s not finished , either . They ' re calling it ` Blackbriar '.
We tracked the phone . Registered to a London reporter named Simon Ross . He works at the Guardian newspaper . 10
You tracking him ?
Yeah , thanks Mike . We have a survey team covering him at work ... and a sneak and peek ' s on their way to his apartment .
Well , who talked to him ? How did he find out about Blackbriar ?
We don ' t know , we pulled his background and ran a cross check on any known anomalies , but we ' ve come up with nothing . But , I think if we follow Ross , we are going to be able ...
Right . Ross is easy . I want the source .
Is that all ?
Yeah . 11
I want rendition protocols and I want the asset put on standby , just in case .
People , listen up , this is a full priority situation
Jimmy , give me Ross ' s profile on one . screen on the wall )
Our target is a British national , Simon Ross , a reporter . I want all his phones , his blackberry , his apartment , his car , bank accounts , credit cards , travel patterns ... I want to know what he ' s going to think before he does . Every dirty little secret he has . And most of all , we want the name and real time location of his source .
All right , let ' s get to it .
Where ' s my picture please ?
That ' s too long .
There ' s more . He was scared . 13
Blackbriar .
Who is it ?
Why aren ' t we hearing this ?
That ' s a hard line , Jimmy , why don ' t we have it ?
Waterloo Station , south entrance , thirty minutes . 14
Who is this ?
This is Jason Bourne .
Okay , he is on the move . Target is mobile .
Okay , people , look sharp , give me eyeballs on the street .
Where ' s that audio on the street ? I want to know where he ' s going ...
Where is he heading ?
Hello ?
What ' s he doing ? I thought we blocked his cell ? Who the hell is he talking to ???
Jimmy , I need that phone !
Activate the asset .
Sir , we haven ' t yet become operational --
I said activate the asset . I want options .
Okay , who ' s the guy in the blue hood ?
Okay , there , he ' s talking to the guy with the hood . Take them down .
Watch that bus ! The bus ! -- don ' t lose them ! Stay triangular and don ' t get blocked .
Take the footbridge . Go to the West Entrance . I ' ll meet you at the newsstand .
No , no , look ... Ross is not on the bus . Split up the team -- get the guy on the bus and send someone to stay on Ross .
I don ' t like this . Patch me through to Met surveillance .
Why do you know so much about me ?
What ?
The article . You talked to someone from Treadstone . Someone there at the beginning . What ' s his name ?
I can ' t tell you that .... Who ' s following me ?
Whoever they are it ' s trouble .
Are they Blackbriar ?
Blackbriar , what ' s Blackbriar ?
I don ' t know . I heard the name this morning for the first time . Whatever it is , my source said it started with you . 22
What ? What are you talking about ?
Look , just help me get away from these people ... and we can talk more ... we can --
operatives ) We have to move .
Answer your phone .
He ' s got to be close . Seal the entrances .
Has she seen me ?
Not yet . Dip left past the photo kiosk .
Straight ahead . News kiosk .
Change of plan . Stop . Tie your shoelace .
Are we clear ?
Clear . News kiosk . Straight ahead .
Straight toward me . Bin man ?
Negative .
He ' s got a gun .
Negative . Keep straight ahead .
We ' re losing him ! We cannot afford to lose him !
Get into cover . Now ! 25
64H What ' s the status of the asset ? 64H
In place in one minute .
Alright , I want to take him now . Get him out of there and have the asset cover it .
Keep moving ...
Faster ....
The front ... 26
GET IN THE STORE . BOURNE ' S bought them thirty seconds .
INSIDE ! BOURNE searching the concourse . Something bothering him . The threat level clicking another notch .
Service doorway -- Now ! 27
Close him down ...
Keep moving .
Through the store room .
Jesus Christ , that ' s Jason Bourne .
Maybe he ' s the source ?
It doesn ' t matter , the asset now has 2 targets . Take them both out .
I ' m going to get you to safety but you have to stay calm do exactly what I say .
Sure , okay .
No , listen to me : Exactly what I say this time . Understand ?
Yes .
Stay here while I look for an escape .
No , stay behind that door .
There . That silver door . Bourne ' s behind that door ?
Okay , pull the agents back and give Bourne ' s location to the asset .
Don ' t move until I tell you .
I ' m going to go for it .
No , No not now .
Oh ... shit ...
Get the asset out of there ...
What about Bourne ?
Get him out of there - NOW !
Hello .
It ' s Vosen . We have a situation .
Sparkling . And a " Heart - Healthy " omelet with goat cheese and peppers .
You ' re late . Traffic ?
I ' m buying .
When the Director called , it was suggested we bring you on --
Funny how different things look depending on where you sit . I look at this as doing a favor for you . Giving you an opportunity to complete some unfinished business .
Jason Bourne .
Really ?
So what do you make of this ? surveillance photos of Bourne in Paris ) French intel picked up Bourne meeting Pierre Elattrache on Tuesday . He threatened to burn our house down if you didn ' t tell him who started Treadstone . That ' s a big problem , wouldn ' t you agree ?
Why ' s it so hard for you to believe ?
Lets try and be adults okay ? We all thought he was done , off the grid . But Bourne ' s back . Maybe he ' s a threat . We both want the same thing here .
We have a leak . Bourne showed up in our surveillance . We had very little time to react .
Bourne saw us coming .
Don ' t second guess an operation from an armchair , Pam . It ' s not fair .
This is Pamela Landy . She ' s gonna be quarterbacking our search effort . I think what we oughta do , just to get started , let ' s go around the room , say who you are and what your spec is .
How ?
So ?
Cross check the secure cell phone usage of everyone with Blackbriar SCI clearance against all calls in and out of Turin during the morning Ross was there
Do you have a better idea ?
Do it Jimmy .
Jesus Christ . 40
Call the RSO at the Embassy and have them take Daniels into custody if he ' s there . If he ' s not , get a grab team to the Calle Norte safe house . Send them in heavy and tell them we ' ll assist with entry .
I ' m worried about Bourne . If he ' s not Ross ' s source , then he must be after Ross ' s source -- just like us .
Team two , ETA Callee Norte ?
Okay , put it live .
That has to be Bourne .
Shit ... Track the passports .
Goddamn it ! Get a back - up team in there !
How long till back - up arrives ?
How long ? entire hub ) Stop ! Hang on . I have an idea ...
What are you doing here ?
Where ' s Daniels ?
Who is this ?
Nicky , I need to do an ID challenge first . Code in : " Sparrow ."
Nicky , this is Noah Vosen . How long have you been on site ?
We have two officers on site . Are you in contact with them ?
Is there any sign of Daniels ?
Hold on Nicky .
What are you doing ? You know Bourne ' s probably listening . 47
How long till back up arrives .
Listen , Nicky . I want you to stay put and secure the premises . It could be an hour until another team arrives .
How long do I have ?
You " disagree " he ' s a threat ? He just took out two more of my men . Not to mention his ultimatum to Ellatrache ?
He wants revenge , Pam . The only realistic way to deal with this is to eliminate the threat .
Okay , where is Daniels headed ?
Okay , Tangier is about 300 miles away , we can make the morning ferry .
Issue a standing kill order on Jason Bourne , effective immediately .
We lost Bourne .
You still think he ' s after Daniels ?
Yeah . Nicky ' s just the means . But if we find Daniels , we ' ll find Bourne .
Daniels knows way too much . Daniels knows everything . We can ' t let them meet .
I ' ll take care of it .
Good . And fill Hirsch in . Just in case .
Do you know who this is ?
I have to get back to the beginning ... or I ' ll never be free of this .
I think he started Treadstone . I remember meeting him . I remember the first day ... Daniels brought me to him .
An initiation ... I guess ...
Why are you helping me ?
No .
We should move . 52
Noah Vosen .
Since he cleaned out a Blackbriar safe and fled to Morocco !
I don ' t have the people on the ground to do that and I ' m not going to risk that file falling into the wrong hands .
What ' s he got ? He ran all of Blackbriar ' s operations in Southern Europe and North Africa .
For Christ ' s sake , Pam , he ' s got our entire playbook . Names , dates , ghost sites , how we train our assets .....
Oh , yes I do , Pam .
That ' s what makes us special . No red tape . No more getting badguys in our sights and then watching them escape while we wait for some bureaucrat to issue the order .
Come on , Pam , you ' ve seen the raw intel . You know how real the threat is . We can ' t afford to have our hands tied like that anymore .
Tell her I ' m unreachable .
Give me the subject ' s location .
Get an elevation and a floor plan , tic - tac - toe . Locate the room . Give the asset Daniels ' s location and the route between Daniel ' s hotel and the bank .
Do we have that room yet ?
Get the hotel ' s trunk line . Run all calls through here with an iso on 117
Now they found Daniels , do you know where he is ?
Find out who .
Tell him you ' re going to meet him and that you have a new phone for him . 57
We ' re not going to stop him . We ' re going to follow him . He ' ll take us right to Daniels .
Find out why .
Sir , we have an unauthorized breach . Someone with active system knowledge has penetrated out protocols . Information was passed to the asset at 14 . 11 . The trace is confirmed and valid . It comes from a computer belonging to Nicky Parsons .
Where did the course deviation occur ?
That ' s where Parson ' s is .
When we ' re finished with Daniels send the asset after her . We find Parsons , we find Bourne .
Not now .
Not now .
On the basis that Nicky Parsons has compromised a covert operation . She is up to her neck in it .
She has betrayed us !
She ' s in league with Jason Bourne for Chrissake !
Yes , I do Pam , it ' s right here and it ' s legal .
It ends when we ' ve won .
Notify the asset of the additional target .
Have the bank release the funds .
Alright , we need to be dead . You need to code that in .
I want to be sure . Have the station chief in Rabat confirm the deaths and do a sub - rosa check ... And keep and eye on Landy .
I can see all their faces . But I can ' t remember any names ....
I was starting to remember who they were ... in India ... with Marie .
I ' ve killed people and I ' ve tried to apologize for what I ' ve done , for what I am . None of it makes it better ...
They ' re going to come for you again . You are going to have to run now .
It gets easier .
Station chief in Rabat just called , they found a body . Bourne ?
Desh .
I hear you ' re still looking for me .
Is that official ?
Good - bye .
Why the hell did she give him that ?
Get some rest , Pam .
You look tired .
He ' s got line of sight on us !
... This is a national security emergency . We have an imminent threat . 74
Jason Bourne is alive and at large in New York City . We believe in one thousand yards of this building . I want an immediate twelve block lockdown of the area . Send a FLASH message to Langley , prep for local backup assistance .
Landy just left the building .
Check Landy ' s phone . Is she using it ?
Nothing ? No calls since Bourne -- ? BACK ROOM TECH Wait a minute . Wait . She just got a text . 75
What the hell do you mean we can ' t read it ?
How do you know a text came if you can ' t read it -- Are we on Landy ?
I want that goddamn text . We need to get out in front of her !
Surround it . Anyone not on Landy goes to Tudor City . Now ! Get the trucks . We ' re going mobile .
Get the map up .
He wouldn ' t have chosen it if he didn ' t have a reason .
As soon as you have eyes on Landy , I want to know .
Copy that , I see her .
Any sign of Bourne ?
Noah Vosen .
This is Jason Bourne .
How did you get this number ?
You didn ' t actually think I was coming to Tudor City , did you ?
No , I guess not . But if it ' s me you want to talk to maybe we can arrange a meet .
Where are you right now ?
In my office . 79
I doubt that . If you were in your office --
We ' d be having this conversation face - to - face .
This is a code ten abort , I want everybody back in the vehicles this is a code ten abort ! Back to the vehicles immediately , back to CRI immediately .
Bourne got into your safe !
... I want the entire building searched . Every room . Every hallway . Every closet . Every goddamm airduct . Do you understand ? I want him found !
Lethal force is authorized .
Tell them again !
Take him out !
into his handheld ) He did what ?!
Get NYPD backup ! And FBI , DEA , any other federal assets we can draft !
10 - 13 . Shots fired . Officer down . Port Authority parking lot . Level four .
Stay out of sight until one of your own arrive .
The asset lost Bourne . We lost him .
What about it ?
Everything stops . EVERYTHING STOPS ! LISTEN UP ! New assignment . Numbers . Four . 91 Fifteen . Seventy - one . What do they mean ?
-- hang on -- wait -- Seventy First Street ? Like what ? Like York and First ? 92
She gave him the facility . She gave him --
I know . Go ! Go ! Drive ! We ' re already on our way . Turn the teams around . Bring them in behind me .
Not long . Get out of there .
No . I ' m going to stay .
Are you crazy , he ' ll --
He ' ll come to the training wing . That ' s what he knows . I ' ll keep him in play until you arrive .
They ' ll kill you for giving me this place .
Why ' d you do it ?
Then stop it . Everything you need is in there .
This is where it started for me , this is where it ends .
Landy ! Right there ! She ' s got Bourne ' s backpack !
agents ) I ' ll find Landy . You get to the training wing and get Bourne !
Do you know who I am ? Where ' s your security room ?
I want to see all your footage for the last three minutes .
Put the gun down . I wouldn ' t be here if I didn ' t want to talk .
I ' ve spent three years running . Three years trying to find out who I was .
You still don ' t have it all back , do you ? You haven ' t filled in all the pieces ?
Let ' s start with the moment you found out I wouldn ' t execute Wombosi . The amnesia wasn ' t the issue , it was the fact that I didn ' t pull the trigger ....
One lapse meant your conditioning had failed .
It was always you , behind Conklin , behind Abbott .... They were just following orders .
I ' m unarmed , Jason .
against the wall ) " David ." I ' m David Webb .
You were David Webb , but not anymore .
Why me ? Why did you pick me ?
You really don ' t remember , do you ? You picked us , Jason .
What does that mean ?
You volunteered .
You volunteered right here .... You didn ' t even blink , Jason . You just handed me these ... 99
Yes , sir .
You were a soldier ready to serve his country . Just like thousands of others , except you were a prodigy with languages ... and a perfect shot .
You said I ' d be saving American lives . Instead you just turned me into a killer .
You could have left at any time . And you knew exactly what it meant for you if you chose to stay . 100
When we ' re finished with you , you ' ll no longer be David Webb .
I ' ll be whoever you need me to be , sir .
Stop running from the truth , Jason . You chose to come here ! You chose to stay ! And no matter how much you want to forget it ... eventually you ' re going to have to face how you chose , right there , to become Jason Bourne !
Who is he ?
We ' ve been through that .
What did he do ?
It doesn ' t matter . You came to us . You volunteered . You said you ' d do anything it takes to save American lives . You ' re not a liar are you ? Or too weak to see this through ? This is it . Let go of David Webb . Will you give yourself to this program ? 101
He ' s ready . Send him to Operations .
Do you remember now ?
I remember . I remember everything .
You can ' t outrun what you did , Jason . You made yourself into who you are .
I ' m done running . That ' s why I ' m here . To end you , to shut this down . I ' m no longer Jason Bourne .
So now you ' re going to kill me ?
No . You don ' t deserve the star they give you on the wall at Langley .
Do you even know why you ' re trying to kill me ? Look at what they make you give .
