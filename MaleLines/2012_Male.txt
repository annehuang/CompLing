I still can't believe that Wilson chose him of all people to run the White House.
Shame he's such a pompous ass.
Somebody mention my name?
Yes sir... No, sir.
Which one is it?
We were talking about what a great speech you gave tonight. Well done, sir.
It's Helmsley, right? I'll remember that.
Professor West?
Sir, the President needs to know this.
Helmsley, how long have you been on the job as science advisor?
Four months this week.
I would say that's enough time to learn that we have rules here. You'll just have to wait until the quarterly science briefing.
If this is about what I said last night, I am truly sorry, sir.
So you didn't like my speech?
Can you please have a look at this, sir? It's really important.
Who wrote this?
An Indian astrophysicist I graduated with from Harvard and Prof. West, the preeminent geologist in the US.
Who else knows about it?
No one, sir.
Let's keep it that way, Helmsley.
I hereby present a motion to meet privately with my seven fellow Heads of State, kindly excluding the rest of the delegates.
Mr. President, judging from the conversations we've had in the past, I can assure you, your English is absolutely fine, for what I have to say.
Six months ago I was made aware of a situation so devastating, that at first, I refused to believe it. However through the concerted efforts of the brightest scientists of several nations, we have now confirmed its validity.
The world as we know it, will soon come to an end.
Oh no. Not again.
Hello?... What do you mean? I'm not late. It's not even 10:30...
Damn it! Kate, I'm on my way... For god's sake...
They're kids, Kate, going on vacation. It's not a doctor's appointment... it's supposed to be fun. You remember that, right? Fun?
... I know it's mosquito season at Yellowstone, Kate. I'll pick some up on the way.
Don't call me Jackson, Noah, I'm your father.
This is better hours for me. Means I can still write.
Simone, how many times have I told you, we don't do Lipo on Fridays. It's too messy.
Have fun guys. And watch out for those bears. Nice car.
Still?
Hang on, sweet pea, let daddy listen to this for a moment...
It's alright Sally.
Honey, calm down.
To a very special place, Lil'bee. It's a lake. A place where mommy and daddy fell in love. Remember the book I gave you?
I'm your dad, Noah.
This wasn't here before.
It's fine guys.
It's gone. The whole darn lake is gone. I swear you guys there was a lake here.
It's okay, Noh'.
I'll be with you in a second, Professor.
Isn't this supposed to be a National Park? There shouldn't be fences. What are you guys doing around here anyway?
I'll handle this officer. Thank you.
So, where did the lake go?
That's what we're trying to find out. We think this whole area has become potentially unstable. I would advise you to take your kids and leave, Mr...
... Curtis.
Are you by any chance the Jackson Curtis, the author of `Farewell Atlantis'?
Yeah, that's me.
What a coincidence. I'm reading your book, as we speak... first third, around day 300, when the shuttle loses communication with earth and drifts off into space.
You're one of lucky 422 who bought it.
Actually I didn't buy it. My father gave it to me.
Oh, I see.
Officer, can you return them to the campgrounds, please. Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
Yes he was, Lil'bee.
What did the government guys tell you?
They think it's not such a good idea to climb over their fences. They feel the area is unstable.
Unstable! Ha-ha! They say its unstable! That's funny...
We'll get some of that tomorrow. For tonight just put your head under the blankie.
I'm not Honey, I promise. Are you wearing your pull-ups?
Did mommy buy you that?
Noah. Things like a cell phone have to be discussed in the family.
Go to sleep guys.
... You have to immediately inform the President, Mr Anheuser. The readings look much worse than I expected.  22. Plus Satnam's neutrino figures from India confirm...
... But you guys said...
We were wrong! By five or six months...
... We have a listener calling in. Bill from Cooke City, you're on the Charlie Frost Show. I wanted to know, where will this all start?
Well, something like this could only originate in Hollywood, Ha-Ha! But seriously, they've got the earth cracking under their asses already, Bill.
Our family believes in the gospel of our Lord Jesus.  23. We have nothing to fear, Charlie. Good for you Bill, good for you!
... This is Charlie Frost reporting live from Yellowstone National Park, soon to become the world's largest active volcano.
Hi. Mind if I join you?
I only got a few minutes.
I just heard part of your broadcast... Mind me asking a question? What exactly is it... that will start in Hollywood?
Actually it's gonna be the whole west coast...
What are you talking about?
The apocalypse, the end of days. The Mayans knew it, the I Ching and the Bible, kind of...
In the year 2012 a cataclysmic event will unfold. Caused by an alignment of the planets in our solar system that only happens every 640,000 years... Just imagine the earth as an Orange...
... our sun will begin to emit such extreme amounts of radiation, that the core of the earth will melt - that's the inside part of the Orange, leaving the crust of our planet free to shift.
In 1958, Prof. Hapgood named it `Earth Crust Displacement'...
... and Albert Einstein endorsed it...
If they all knew, don't you think somebody would tell us?
They can't. Just think about it. First the stockmarket would crash...
A seat?
They're building spaceships, man.
Oh... I see.
No really... One of my listeners, a geography professor at UTSC, has even figured out where they're building them. He sent me a map.
Well... Charlie, I think I gotta go. My kids are sleeping.
Get them out of Yellowstone, man. It's gonna get ugly here.
Night, Charlie.
Sorry for the delay, folks. But even in times like these, a man has got to eat...
Why don't we make a baby?
Honey, I created them. And now suddenly I can't touch them?
You always act strange after he shows up?
Maybe biologically. Can I remind you what that guy did? First you gave up med school to have Noah... Then you practically raise him and Lilly by yourself while he sat glued to a laptop writing that junk.
Yeah, published! You know your mother was right. You've always been drawn to guys with lofty dreams and empty pockets. But not this time right, sweetheart?
See what?
You know Kate, we have to keep working at this... our relationship. Because I won't end up being just a re-run of you and Jackson. I mean Honey, I feel like... something is pulling us apart?
Just stop scratching. You'll get them infected.
Something for Mosquito bites please?
What?
Kids, we have to pack up and go find mommy.
Sir, you have to initiate the boarding process immediately.
Is this even possible? What's our information from China?
They estimate four of the ships will be ready for launch.
Only four?
If it's alright with you sir, I'll brief the panel about the new development.
I'd rather have Adrian do that. They trust him. I told him to be in on the meeting.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we all knew this day would come. But we never imagined it would come this soon.
I would like to pass this over to my science advisor, Adrian Helmsley.
I'll make this brief...
... According to our latest data from Yellowstone, the temperature of the subterranean crust of the earth, the cement that holds our landmass in place, is increasing at a rapid rate, much faster than anticipated...
... This causes extreme polar instability. The magnetic fields have decreased by more than 80% over the last 48 hours.
Two, maybe three days if we're lucky.
Apologies Prime minster. He's still new to the job.
Nevertheless, Mr. Antonioni, we have to make an immediate decision.
Zultan!
You shut up... when I talk to my boy, understand?
Good... That is good. BOXER) Zultan my friend. Do not forget. We are fighters. We never go down. We always stay on our feet...
Lilly, we're home sweetie. Wake up big man.
We tried calling but -
Good. That is good. I'm sending the Gulfstream to pick up Alec and Oleg.
Are you guys blind? I can't run people over.
Hey Jackson. Took you a while...
Where can I rent a plane?
... Kate, we have to get out of LA! I've rented a plane for us. Get the kids ready! I'll be there in five.
Are you kidding me!
Not that we'd expect him to remember.
California is going down! Pack up the kids!
The Governor's a meathead, how would he know anything? Kate listen! You gotta trust me over some politician. Come on.
We have to leave! Noah, let's go!
Noah, now! Kate please...
I think he's right.
Get in the car!
Damn it! Where's the pilot?
I... had a couple lessons...
Did you cover taking off?
Yeah.
That's good enough for me.
I'm coming.
Come on, come on...
INSTRUMENTS) But I'm supposed to check all these first...
I can't get it up!
Are you okay?
I didn't. Do we have enough fuel to make it to Yellowstone?
You remember when I told you about the dam in China? Well, it's happening much sooner than we anticipated.
Where are you, dad? What exactly is the course of the `Freedom' right now?...
I love you, dad.
Have you seen this?  44.  Prof. West silently nods and beckons Adrian, who follows him down the hall into a dark control room. They look at a wall- sized high def monitor.
Any news from Yellowstone?
Guys, there's fuel! Fill her up and I'll look for Charlie.
Kate, everything this guy said so far has happened. I'll be right back.
It's fine! I'll take her.
... I am standing here at the highest point on what is the rim of this super volcano...
He's got to be close by, Lil'bee...
Listen to me. We have to find Charlie. He's got a secret map, you know, like Jack Sparrow in `Pirates'.
Lil', we have to work as a team now, okay? You have to help me.
... The last time this baby blew, was 640,000 years ago...
Dial Mommy's number, sweetheart.
Tell her we'll be back in ten minutes.
... I tell you guys, any minute now... any minute the fireworks will start...
You're the best, darling. Give Daddy the phone... Kate I am sorry, I can't talk...
You wait here for me! You watch the ship while Captain Curtis talks to the pirate. Okay?
... I wish you guys at home could see this on TV...
The spaceships Charlie, where are they?
You can't make it there.
We have a plane. We can get you out of here too. Let's go Charlie!
You'll never make it out in time. Just stay and enjoy the big bang. That your kid?
Where is that god damn map!
Easy, easy. Watch the mic... I don't know. Somewhere in my camper.
... The ash cloud will travel everywhere.  49. First the lights will go out in Vegas, then Dallas, St. Louis and then Washington DC...
We're on our way.
... it's beautiful, kids! Just beautiful!
Just don't look back, Lil'bee!
Majestic!... Oh yeah!
Oh baby! It's coming!
`This is the end, my friend'...
... Folks, always remember, you heard it first from Charlie.
LILLY! DOWN!  A firebomb hits the RV, ripping half the roof off.
Stay down there, Lil'! We're almost there! Just keep looking at daddy.
Stay down darling.
You guys go! I'll be right there!
We have to take off!
Kate, I'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die!
Kate, grab him for god sake. We're almost out of runway.
Thanks for waiting guys.
We're gonna need a bigger plane.
Just a few minutes ago Yellowstone erupted, sir. The ash cloud will reach Washington in roughly 7 hours. Maybe 6. We have strong easterly winds...
And the crustal displacement?
No one knows, sir.
Let's get the government airborne and... I mean now.
Where is the President, Sally?
The whole North American continent is about to perish, and Wilson decides to go to church!
He's praying sir. Which considering the circumstances is not a bad idea.
Maybe. But right now I need the leader of the free world off his knees and on Air Force One. Wheels up 1900 hours. Can I leave that with you Helmsley?
Mr. President? We need to get you out of Washington immediately.  55.  President Wilson stays with his head bowed.
Now matter how idealistic you are taking office. You lose your innocence behind that desk. Laura was right. People have died because of the decisions I made.
That's not your fault sir.
You sound like Anheuser.
Laura's never looked at me like that before. Only once... When I told her, her mother had died. You knew the first lady?
A little.
You know what she said to me that night we brought her to the hospital? `Tommy... I think you should do a lottery. Every one should have a chance to go'. That's what Dorothy said to me. That's what we should have done.
There would have been chaos, sir.
You know what I believe, Adrian. I believe nature should choose for itself, from itself.
Don't let her go. You'll regret it if you do. Prove to Laura what kind of a man you are. And I'll do the same... You go now. And watch your back for Anheuser.  56.  Adrian stares at the President in disbelief.
But sir?
Go. That's an order Helmsley.
Would you tell my daughter... there's nothing on earth that I cherish more than her.
I told you we should have gone to my parents' in the Rockies.
You don't understand, it's our only chance.
This isn't one of your crazy stories now. How the hell are we gonna make it to China?
Where's Anheuser?
The President is not coming. I couldn't convince him to.
So, the captain doesn't want to leave his sinking ship? Well, Mr. Helmsley, we just learned that the Vice President's chopper crashed 80 miles north of Atlanta.
What about the Speaker of the House?
In this chaos... I have no idea!
But she's Commander In Chief now. Sir, I just think -
I don't care what you think, Helmsley.
He wanted to stay with his people.
There is a protocol for just this situation Ms. Wilson and I'm afraid we'll have to follow it to the letter.
We can't get stuck here.
She's a patient, honey.
Nice work.
You bastard. You knew it all along! You and those spoiled rotten sons of yours...
I found us a plane, an Antonov. They were just about to take off, but the tower didn't let them.
Can you still fly that thing?
Sure... But I need a copilot.
Let's go!
It's Russian.
Guys, follow me!
You'll find folding seats on each side of the cargo hold...
We had VIP tickets for that.
You check the main bus for the hydraulics. I'll balance the tanks.
Uh... What?
Work the radio and keep an eye on the fuel, okay?
We have to get going!  63.  Sasha hits the throttle.
We're going, we're going.
We're not gonna make it!
Shut up! We will!

Was that the Eiffel Tower?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on our way to China.
They seem to like each other.
I guess... So tell me Mr. Karpov - how much did you pay?
One billion euro, per seat.
That's disgusting.
You know Curtis, I wasn't always businessman. I am a boxer. Was my only playing when I was a boy, back in Murmansk. My coach... ... his name also Yuri... He always said: `Someone wants to beat you... he has to kill you first'.
Let's get this straight, Sasha. I'm not a pilot. I'm a plastic surgeon. I just took some lessons to overcome my fear of flying.
Why did you give up?
It didn't work.
What about the wheels we lost at take- off?
There's 14 on each side. Some of them must still be there.
Guys, you really oughta take a look at this.
What is that?
The State of Hawaii!
Not good. That is not good.
How much fuel do we have?
Not enough. We'll have to make a water landing somewhere in the South China Sea.
At least we won't need our landing gear.
What about it?
We lost it all... in Vegas.
Can I come in?
But I do...
Your Dad and I... we were trying to protect you.
But you were doing a good job.
You know what your father believed. That nature will choose itself from itself.
That's not true.
What would you say were the chances of a first time, middle-aged writer, who barely sold 500 copies of his novel making it on board this plane?
It's called `Farewell Atlantis' and it's a fantastic read. It's part of our legacy now.
What if I tried to sort some of this mess out? I need to know you can forgive me...
One more thing. Your father told me you were the most precious thing to him in the whole world... You are to me too.
Sally, can you take care of them. I'll go check with the Red Cross...
Who can help me with missing persons?
Don't worry about it. You're doing a great job son...
That's affirmative, Mr. President. Until communication is restored, I am in command.
Couldn't sleep huh? Me neither.
Nothing, just static. Not even an emergency signal.
I couldn't have left you...
By `people' are we talking about me?
Well I certainly eat a lot more cereal now...
Do you love him? Gordon...
Any clue what to expect next, Professor?
Do we have any news from the Japanese seaboard?
I'm coming home Dorothy...
At least some good news.
We expect enormous tsunamis to reach landfall in every continent. The Cho Ming area will be impacted in approximately six hours.
... and it looks like the crust has shifted by nearly 23 degrees in a south- westerly direction. Here's the computer simulation.
Our data also shows, that our earth's poles have reversed their magnetic fields... ... These are their new positions.
So Helmsley, what you're telling us here is that... the north pole is now somewhere in Wisconsin?
It's the south pole, sir.
Engine failure. GOVNO! Two of six are down. We must get ready.
Let's go wake up the kids.
What are you talking about? I don't hate Gordon.
I don't know him that well.
I'll give it a try, Noah. I promise.
Sasha told us, it could get a little bumpy... and wet.
Your daddy has to tell you something.
I know that with my writing and work I didn't have a lot of time for you both...
I wasn't there for you, the way I should have been.
... And I am so very sorry for that.
Don't ask me how that happened.
It's as if the whole earth shifted by 1500 miles...
No shit. It's called 'Earth Crust Displacement' Gordon... Prof. Hapgood, 1958.
Way to go Charlie!
We lost our last two engines.
Get up! Follow me!
We're taking the Bentley!
CHTO ZA... Gordon! We're still too fast!
SHUT UP EVERY ONE!  They all go quiet, except for a few muffled barks from Caesar. Yuri speaks towards the dashboard, slowly and clearly.
Your turn Gordon! Go! Make sure that they make it out of here before I touch down!
What about you?!
I'll be fine! I have to land this thing!
We're waiting for Sasha and Gordon.
He said he'll be fine and we should get out of here before he touches down.
Thank you... Say thank you, kids.
You think I did not know about you and Sasha? May god rest that poor bastard's soul.
What!... Did that just happen!?
I've been told of damages?
What do mean we can't board Number 4? I want to speak to your supervisor.
I want your name!
Keep thinking warm thoughts sweetheart. You're doing great.
Did you know he asked for a discount... and he paid in installments?
You're better off without him. What he said about you and Sasha, is it true?
You guys hear that?
Hey! Help! Wait for us!
Shit! Shit!
Dr. Wilson, there's a protocol for all that. You just stick to your art. We'll handle the rest.
Satnam? Where are you?
What?!
Satnam, what happened?
Do we have the latest satellite images of Napam, India?
Helmsley, what's going on here?
Looks like our model was wrong.
Satnam was talking about a wave from the East.
What does this mean?
The flooding will happen earlier. Bobby, can you plug in the new data please?
Satnam didn't get picked up.
This one is at least 1500 meters high!
Talk to me Helmsley. What does this mean for us?
Bobby, plug in the new data and adjust the count down?
Get me the other Heads of State.
Come with daddy.
At least take our children with you. Please.
For the same reason you sent for your parents.
They're leaving without us!
Look! Idiot! They are leaving you behind too!
Move Lil'bee!
Let that stupid dog go!
Tamara! Come on! Get in!
Down there! Oleg, you go first!
Tamara! Get in!
Anheuser convinced them all to launch.
Anheuser! We have to stop this madness.
Bobby, make sure the other bridges can hear this.
What do you think you're doing?
I know exactly what I'm doing. Turn it on!
This is Adrian Helmsley, science advisor to President Wilson...
... But to be human means to care for each other, and civilization means to work together to create a better life. If that's true there is nothing human and nothing civilized about what we're doing here. Ask yourselves ... Can we really stand by and let all those people out there die?
A civilization that allows that, does not deserve to survive. Or at least I don't want to be part of it.
We'll miss you Helmsley but somehow we'll get by. Officer switch that off.
Don't do it!
Have you lost your mind? Look at the countdown. We have less than five minutes left... And none of our ships have the resources to feed those people. If you save them today we all starve tomorrow.
There is a young astrophysicist from India who is the reason we are all here, trying to give mankind a second chance. He's the one who discovered it all, the one who connected the dots. We all owe him our lives.
I just learned that he was killed with his family by a tsunami in eastern India. You know why?
He died because we forgot to pick him up. I beg you... whatever our future holds don't let us start it with an act of cruelty. What will you tell your children... and their children?
Captain Michaels, you heard them.
Noah! Watch out!
We have to stop it!
You did it, man. You did it.
Can you zoom in?
I know those kids. Remember the book I told you about? Their father wrote it.
Do it!
Pull yourself up!
Oleg! Catch your brother!
Why is the stern gate not closing?
I think we found the problem.
How did they get in there?
You're damn right something went wrong! Congratulations Helmsley, you may have just killed us all but as long as your conscience is clean...
Let's get an emergency crew there right now. I'll meet them at the Hydraulic Chamber.
You think you're the main man now, just because your fucking the President's daughter?
What are you all waiting for?
There's no way to override it?
Then how will we get to the hydraulic chamber?
Is there any way to talk to them?
We have to move him higher. Over there!
Mr. Curtis... I'm Adrian Helmsley. We met once before. Your daughter is with me.
You're our only hope.
I'll go back. I'll try my best.
You stay with Mommy.
I'll be right back...
Captain, what's happening?
Captain Michaels - close the gate!
If you would ever consider to give me another chance... I promise, I'll always be there when you need me.
... and all we can hear is the sound of our own breathing that reminds us we are still sharing our memories, hopes and ideas.
... And funny, just today we found out that the entire crew of the Atlantis, somehow or another, has relatives in Wisconsin. The end.
Less than 500. It's what you might call a cult classic.
Well that's healthy Dr. Wilson. Something we could maybe explore... unless you have other pressing engagements.
There's nothing we can go back to Lil'bee. Whatever's out there, that's our home now. Don't be scared.
That's my big girl.
You called for me, sir?
This is Helmsley.
Dad. We're coming to pick you guys up. How's Tony?
Put that woman down Helmsley.
Pardon me?
There was no white kid better than you. I'm terribly sorry I said that.
I thought you might want this.
I finally finished your book Jackson.
Excuse me, I believe he's addressing the author. Well, what did you think?
I'd say... those astronauts of yours would be shitting themselves, if they knew all their relatives are now stuck in the South Pole.
