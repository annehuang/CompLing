Fucking hot box .
Dirt over here tastes like dog shit .
I guess you ' d know .
I got a military - aged male , on a cell phone , watching the convoy . Over .
He could be calling his old lady .
He stepped off .
Hold up . I got a woman and a kid , 200 yards out , moving toward the convoy .
Her arms aren ' t swinging . She ' s carrying something .
She just pulled a grenade . An RKG Russian grenade . I think she gave it to the kid .
You got eyes on this ? Can you confirm ?
They fry you if you ' re wrong . Send your ass to Leavenworth .
Don ' t ever leave your gun in the dirt .
Yes , sir .
Helluva shot , son . You got a gift . You ' re gonna make a fine hunter someday .
Everything dies to give life .
Can it see me ?
It ' s a deer , son .
You shot it , you deal with it .
There are three types of people in this world . Sheep , wolves and sheepdogs .
Some people prefer to believe that evil doesn ' t exist in the world , and if it ever darkened their doorstep they wouldn ' t know how to protect themselves ... those are the sheep .
Then you got predators who use violence to prey on the weak . They ' re the wolves .
Then there are those blessed with the gift of aggression and an overpowering need to protect the flock .
These men are the rare breed that live to confront the wolf --
They are the sheepdog .
Now we ' re not raising any sheep in this family and I will whoop your ass if you turn into a wolf --
But we take care of our own . And if someone picks a fight with you or bullies your brother , you have my permission to finish it .
The guy was picking on Jeff .
That true ?
Yes sir ... Yes , he was ...
And did you finish it ?
Then you know who you are ...
You know your purpose .
Wasn ' t nobody there and you come away with a belt buckle too damn big to wear . What you supposed to do with it ?
You ' re supposed to get laid with it . I ' m gonna wear it in and see if it puts Sarah in the mood .
A strong wind ' d put Sarah in the mood .
Is that what they say ?
You know what they called her in high school --
Don ' t say it .
Sarah suck - a --
Shit man --
Who wants to hump a rodeo star ?
What the fuck --
Why would you do this ?
You didn ' t know ?
Get out .
Some people ain ' t worth fighting for .
But she was right ...
A job is a job . At least we ' re outside .
Jeff , wake up . Look at this --
Look what they did ...
I saw what they did , on our soil , and --
Yes , sir . But I can ' t see myself on a ship . I ' d wanna be in the fight --
SEALs ?
I ain ' t much of a swimmer --
I ' m not most men , sir . I don ' t quit .
You a quitter , boy ?
No , sir !
Bullshit , you are fleet - meat . Don ' t turn away . Look up and take it . You ' re old as fuck . Did you join the Navy cause you had such a good time on Noah ' s Arc ? How old are you ?
30 , sir .
30 ! You fart dust and could ' ve fathered half these boys . You think cause you had a pop - gun back in Texas you ' re cut out to be a SEAL ?
No , sir .
No , you ' re not cut out to be one ?
What kind of asshole joins the Navy but hates the water .
I love water , hooyah .
My ass you do .
Is that you giggling you fat fuck ? Look at you . You ' re so fat they had to baptize you at Sea World . Your momma fat too ?
Don ' t lie to me ! I bet we could use her panties as a parachute . What the fuck are you doing here fatboy ? Do your feet get wet when you shower ? When ' s the last time you saw your pecker ? You ' re not a Seal , you ' re a fuckin Walrus . A big giggling Walrus . " Biggles " that ' s your new name --
-- and that ' s your ticket home . Just drag your jelly - roll ass up and ring it and you ' ll be headed home to momma Shamu .
Two hundred .
Did I ask you to count ?
No , sir .
Was that your ass talking then ?
That ' s a quitter . If he quits here , he ' ll quit in battle . When shit gets hairy he can ' t step up . You get shot , he can ' t pull you out . We ' re gonna weed out the quitters and see if we can find a warrior or two .
Wave goodbye to the sun , boys ...
-- and when I told her the condom broke she started crying and begging me to do something . And I ' m a virgin , I don ' t know what to do , but I ' d heard if you pour Coke up there you won ' t get pregnant -- So we went to 7 - 11 , got a liter of Coke and drove back into the woods . She took her panties off and did a handstand against a tree but when I start pouring , she starts screaming , " it stings , it stings " but when I ' d stop , she ' d scream " no don ' t stop " and it ' s fizzing out and --
Hooyah . I ' d toss that critter shitter on a baguette and get my eat on .
Dangerous , sir . Feeling dangerous .
I ' m gonna try and get into sniper school .
Can you shoot ?
I can hunt . And what ' s cooler than being a sniper ?
Blowing shit up . Blowing shit up is way cooler .
It could be the leather pants .
Corduroy .
Only thing that happens to me after three beers is a fourth .
I ' m no redneck , I ' m a Texan .
We ride horses , they ride their cousins .
I polish dolphins . They have to be polished in captivity or their skin disintegrates .
To be honest , you look a little sad .
So am I tall enough to buy you a drink ?
How about this : one shot , one answer .
I ' m just finishing BUD / S .
That was two questions ...
What ' s that mean you know all about us ?
How can you say we ' re self - centered ? I ' d lay down my life for my country .
Cause it ' s the greatest country on earth and I believe it ' s worth protecting . I ' m sorry this guy hurt your sister but that ' s not me . Nice talking to you .
You said you ' d never date a SEAL , so I ' m going home .
Well in that case ... what ' s your name ?
Nice to meet you , Taya . I ' m Chris Kyle .
Our instructors say our biggest enemies are ego , liquor , and women .
I wanted to be a cowboy -- but I did that and I felt like I was meant for more .
I rescued that bar from you .
Do you like country music ?
You want kids ?
That ' s a shitty thing to tell a girl .
But those wrong picks put you here . They made you who you are . And I like who you are .
I don ' t know ... I just pray I can do my job if that day comes .
Check . I ' m dialed for windage .
You ' re trembling ...
We don ' t have to do this ...
If I close my off - eye I can ' t see what ' s out there .
Negative . There ' s something --
There it is .
I know enough . You ' re a package deal , babe .
What are you afraid of ?
I ' m going to marry you , and we ' re going to start a family .
I love you . I ' m done .
Would you believe me if I told you I was painted green and on an IV two hours ago ?
Package deal babe .
They say it ' ll be over in 6 weeks .
Don ' t be afraid . It ' s all part of the plan .
I ' m not the only one going to war .
AQI have put a price on your heads and extremists from around the globe are flooding the borders to collect on it .
You snipers will be paired with a man to watch your back and inserted along the main road to do " overwatch " for 1st Marines going door to door . Your job is to protect those Marines at all costs .
The city was evacuated . Any military - aged male still here , is here to kill you . Let ' s bring these boys in safe and get our asses back home . Move --
Keep your head down , Tex . The Muj ' got snipers too .
A sniper won ' t aim for your head .
They got this sniper that ' s been hitting headshots from 500 yards out --
They got sniping in the Olympics now ?
What ' re we looking for ?
You ever hunt ?
I ain ' t that kind of red - neck .
You just got your first kill , Goat .
I ' m going to the roof . You stay here and be on the lookout for farm animals .
I got a military - aged male , on a cell phone , watching the convoy . Over .
He stepped off .
Hold up . I got a woman and a kid , moving toward the convoy .
Her arms aren ' t swinging . She ' s carrying something .
She just pulled a grenade . An RKG Russian grenade . I think she gave it to the kid .
You got eyes on this ? Can you confirm ? Over .
They fry you if you ' re wrong . Send your ass to Leavenworth .
- Fuck that was gnarly .
Shit yeah . Evil bitch !
You hear that ?
Get the fuck off me .
That ' s your overwatch , Einstein . You can thank him later . Keep moving .
That was sniper fire . Shooter is on our side of Elizabeth street . Over .
Smells like piss in here . You covered our ass out there , man . Appreciate it . Those were ballsy shots .
And they were clean . Right ?
Hell yeah , they were .
That sniper walked right up our ass .
I chewed out our security detail . It won ' t happen again .
My shooter statements are on the dresser .
Six ?
Should be eight . Two got dragged off . Something wrong ?
No ... but you got more kills than the rest of the snipers combined .
They still got one of our guys .
You can ' t shoot what you can ' t see .
Heard you got your dick wet .
Where is everybody ?
We ' re just picking our dicks here , training those fucking haji soldiers .
Why ain ' t you out there ?
I got the shits . Marc Lee said you were on fuckin fire out there .
You still read comic books ?
It ' s a fuckin graphic novel . Talk to me , man . Did you pop your cherry ?
This kid didn ' t even have hair on his balls and his mom hands him a grenade -- sends him running off to kill Marines .
You saw his balls ?
It was evil , man . That was hate like I ' ve never seen it before .
That kid could ' ve taken out ten Marines --
I know .
You did your job . End of fuckin story .
It ' s just not how you imagine the first one going down .
How about the other ones ? What about the other kills ?
The other ones -- were righteous . Like God was blowing on my bullets .
By every kill , do you mean just our kills or you ' re monitoring the bad guys too ?
Sorry , was that a question ?
I got a armed military - aged male moving tactically with a car battery . Maybe he needs a jump ?
Well , I don ' t know what a Koran looks like but I can describe what he was carrying -- it was pressed metal , fired 7 . 62s and looked just like an AK - 47 .
Listen up ladies and genitals . The Legend here would like you to know that when it comes to sniping it ' s better to be lucky than good ! Our boy here has a Texas horseshoe crammed so far up his ass that --
That ' s not how the call - home goes , babe .
There are things we can ' t say over the phone .
I can ' t stop thinking about that pink silky thing you wore on our honeymoon ...
Yeah --
It was a good three days . I miss you bad .
Yeah . But I got my gun in one hand and the phone in the other --
You ' re horny preggers .
You could be 300 pounds I ' d still do you .
How ' s my boy ?
I can ' t wait to see the way you are with him . You ' re gonna be incredible .
I just know . I can see it .
I haven ' t checked any email .
What happened ?
Taya .
What happened to jump school ? I thought --
Deployed where ? Where ' s he going ?
These Marines rush in like they been doing , they ' ll get their asses shot off .
They ' re Marines . They don ' t get the training we do . Half of them were civilians six months ago .
So let ' s coach them up . I ' ll show them how Team Guys do it and lead a unit in the street .
Can ' t do . We need you on overwatch .
But if I was down in the street --
House - to - house is the deadliest job here . You got some kind of savior complex ?
I just wanna get the bad guys . And I can ' t shoot them if I can ' t see ` em .
You got a hot hand . These Marines all know your name now and they think they ' re invincible with you up there .
They ' re not --
They are if they believe they are . Just keep banging on the long - gun and let these ground - pounders sniff out Zarqawi .
You said that AQI sniper was in the Olympics -- but Iraq hasn ' t qualified a shooter in the last three games .
Mustafa ' s not Iraqi . He ' s from Syria .
Once you make entry I can ' t see shit , so keep it slow and push through the target .
Fuck this -- I ' m going down to clear houses with the Marines . You coming ?
No man . No . I like my life . I wanna make it home . I go fishing and do all kind of cool shit . It ' s not my job to knock down doors . Those guys picked the wrong fucking job . I ain ' t doing that shit .
If I don ' t see you down there , you make sure I don ' t see you again .
You wanna be a sniper ? Swap me guns .
I ' ll roll with you guys if that ' s cool ?
It ' s 32 . But who ' s counting .
Y ' all are meateaters for sure but I got a little training I could show you , some simple shit , that might just keep us above ground . What do you say ?
Down . Down ! On the floor , now !
I will fucking shoot you ! Down ! Get down --
You were ordered to evacuate . Why are you still here ?
Who will know we ' ve spoken ?
Bring the other guys in .
Who is he ? I need a name .
So he ' s some kind of enforcer ?
We want Zarqawi . Where do we find Zarqawi ?
How do we find him ?
We don ' t even have proof this guy exists .
I ' m sorry . I want to help you . I do . But I need names , places , phone numbers --
Give me a name , Sheik . Give me something .
Yes sir , it does .
And you ' re the secret squirrel with the cash , right ?
He left that part out .
Or he could be upset The Butcher cut off his wife ' s hand . Either way , seems like you ' d wanna explore it .
But you don ' t know his real name or you ' d have it written up there .
He ' s asking for 100 , 000 .
If we ' re going back out , TEAM 3 could pull security --
I went to seminary school before I joined the Navy . Came close to being a preacher .
Why didn ' t you ?
I love to gamble , man . Love those dice .
My kind of preacher .
It ' s like that now , huh ?
You haven ' t heard ? I ' m The Legend . Hey babe --
It ' s a boy !
Hell yeah . Congratu --
I heard one shot .
Check . Large caliber . Came in at an angle , gotta be 300 or more out --
He ' s all over us . You get a bead ?
Negative --
Minaret , 11 o ' clock !
You got eyes on that ?
Negative .
Eyes on The Butcher . He ' s got that Sheikh ' s kid in the street --
Fuck !--
-- requesting back - up . We ' re pinned down taking sniper fire on approach of high - value target , GRID 04536236 . Over .
We ' re on the wrong end of this .
I ' m gonna pop smoke for cover but don ' t move till I say .
Hold .
We gotta go --
Holding ! Hold ...
Move now . Go --
How you know he ' d wait --
Cause I ' d wait .
Go around . I ' ll go high .
Hears the drill and Omar ' s screams . He ' ll be exposed but -- HE POPS UP to shoot The Butcher . Before he can get set --
Rage animates him . He staggers to his feet , FIRING HIS M4 on the minaret until the clip expires . Then --
He had line - of - sight 500 meters out .
Colonel Gronski is all over Marc , bro .
We need to work up a squad to pursue him .
They ' re shutting us down .
What do you mean ?
We ' re confined to base pending an incident review .
Can he do that ? Just shelf us like that ? I ship home in three weeks .
It ' s gonna be a long three weeks .
Shh . I ' m know . I ' m so sorry .
You ' re the most beautiful thing I ' ve ever seen .
Our bedroom .
If it catches the light ...
They ' re mine . I swear ...
I ' m nervous too .
I am ... What if that little alien reaches out and grabs me ?
Huh ?--
Maybe we just relax here ?
Good . Doing good .
Not really .
I ' m just happy to be home .
If you wanna help , you should be looking at my knees . I don ' t know what I did but --
No , ma ' am .
Only when I ' m thirsty .
Is that high ?
I ' ll look into it . Thanks doc .
You sabotaged me back there .
It is okay . I ' m fine .
Babe , I ' m driving down the freeway , it ' s sunny and 72 degrees . I ' m fine . But there are people dying over there and I look around and it ' s like it ' s not even happening . It ' s barely on the news , no one talks about it . No one cares . And if I stay too long I ' ll forget about it too .
We ' re at war and I ' m headed to the mall .
I don ' t belong here . I can ' t help anybody -
Oh shit --
I ' m going back .
My little man ...
Look at our boy . Look what we did . I love you , baby . We made it --
This sniper is recording his kills . Mustafa . They sell these in the street .
I don ' t want you thinking about it . I don ' t need you worrying .
No , it ' s not . They ' re savages .
They ' re fuckin savages .
Slower than Christmas .
Can you give me a second --?
Hey , grunt --
Chris ?
Y ' alright ? You in one piece ?
You okay ? Jeff ?--
I heard you ' re kickin ass our here . All the guys , that ' s what they say --
You ' re my hero , bro . Always have been .
The Legend ...
I ' m gonna miss my ride .
What happened ?
I ' m just tired , man . I ' m -- I ' m going home .
I ' m proud of you . You hear me ?
Dad too . He ' s proud of you .
Fuck this place --
What ?
Fuck this place .
Thank you , sir .
Don ' t tell my wife , she might take that number right about now .
Yes , sir .
You guys know how I hate this shit so shut your traps . Our target is Amir Khalaf Fanus aka The Butcher . We ' ll be heading in under cover of darkness , sector P13 , north of the river --
You give good power - point , Legend .
Is this thing bulletproof ? You never open it so I assumed ...
God , country , family , right ?
You got a God ?
You getting weird on me ?
We had this electric fence around our property in Oregon and us kids used to see who could grab it and hang on the longest . War feels like that , it puts lightning in your bones , makes it hard to hold on to anything else .
You need to sit this one out ?
I just wanna believe in what we ' re doing --
Evil lives here , we ' ve seen it .
It lives everywhere --
You want to invite these motherfuckers to come fight in San Diego ? Or New York ? We ' re protecting more than this dirt .
Hooyah then . Lets go kill this fucker .
Breacher - up .
Tell em they won ' t be leaving till we do -- Ask if they seen him .
-- Private eyes , we ' re watching you , watching your every move ...
Big freezers .
Let ' s keep eyes on it get pictures of anyone coming and going .
Fucking Chief Nappy - nap .
What do we got ?
16 military aged males have gone in .
Sixteen ?
They serve more customers than McDonalds .
And check this .
He still inside ?
I ' m only clocking one point of entry . He ' s in there , but it ' s no easy breach .
When they see it ' s The Legend they ' ll probably just invite him in --
You got a problem ? I didn ' t promote myself .
No , I did it for you . You ' d never have made Chief if I nicknamed you " The Myth ".
-- naw , it ' s Legend ' s Navy now . Just hope he leaves some for the rest of us .
Hash out tactics . We go at zero - dark . And Big Giggles is making the coffee .
Tell him that ' s very generous of him .
Tell him he ' s gonna be shipped off for detention and the Iraqi courts can decide what to do with him -- or he can help us get inside that restaurant down there .
That ' s a bad move --
He ' s our breech . He ' s a fucking way in --
If something happens --
He ' s AQI man , look what he ' s holding .
It ' s his choice . Tell him .
We have eyes on the target . Flushing them out the back --
Negative . Nothing yet .
Help him --
They ' re coming back up ! Watch your six --
-- I can ' t hear you . Say again .
Move .
Pull back ! Loading --
Got you .
RPG ! AN RPG burns down the alley , screaming between them and EXPLODES INTO SNIPER NEST . As dust clouds the night --
Contact . Eyes on The Butcher . 12 o ' clock .
Dauber ? You got visual ? Confirm .
Advancing along the wall . The Butcher jumps into a truck .
He ' s on the move . Crossing !
Got you . Got you . Go , go , go --
I offered his father detention . I gave him a choice --
Tell him this boy ' s father was fighting for the people that butchered the clerics we found in the freezer in there .
If I ask for your help you ' re the one they carve up next . I ' ve seen it happen .
You tell him to deliver The Butcher to us , or the devil comes back .
Hey , some help here -- She ' s crying --
words spoken from afar ) You don ' t get to choose , bubba .
You get what it gives you . That ' s how this thing works .
Don ' t do this . Get up . Come on --
Get off the floor . Right now --
That ' s me .
Did I --?
Yeah . Right . Well , you Marines saved our ass plenty out there . How you holding up ?
Did you lose some friends ?
Yeah , I -- I ' m sorry to hear that .
We have the rest of our lives for that .
daughter ) We can wait . They can ' t .
-- we are tailing the Butcher ' s courier , turning onto Maryland Street . Over .
I bought the ring .
Here ?
They ' re cheaper here .
You want some savage ' s ring ? What if it ' s a blood diamond ?
What the fuck do you care ? You spilled more blood than anyone !
Not for a rock .
Whatever , man .
Ease off , don ' t get too close . You gonna tell her where it came from ?
Hell no ! I ' ll tell her I got from Zales .
20 years from now , we ' ll have a reunion and you ' ll be married to a dude .
The Butcher has his peepers out .
This motherfucker is Keyser S  ze . Next time you got a shot try not to miss .
I coulda taken him in that alley if I didn ' t have to save your ass --
Whatever helps you sleep at night .
You gonna be my best man ?
Is it just me ? Or other guys too ?
You fucking egomaniac --
Rooftop , twelve - o ' clock --
Get me a shot , grandma .
That should do it .
What the fuck !? How ' d he survive --
Rubber junk - man ' s got your horseshoe .
Clear .
We ' re headed to the roof . Secure the van .
No ammo , no jihad .
How the hell ' d he make that ?
He didn ' t --
So much for leading us to the Butcher .
So much for him having my horseshoe .
She ' ll take it to Zales and try to find out how much your spent .
She ' s not like that .
They ' re all like that .
It ' s giant , bro . Four karats . It had to belong to one of Saddam ' s bitches --
No !--
Biggles is down . Man down . chiseled with grief ) No , buddy . No ! Stay with me --
Cover ! I need cover . He ' s picking us off .
I ' m got it . I got it -- I can walk --
-- I ' m sorry --
You got nothing to be sorry for . I shouldn ' t have had us up there --
Am I gonna die ?
-- it was always gonna be me --
Coulda been any of us . Just hang on --
Not you . Not the Legend . You lucky fuck --
Don ' t die , Ryan . You hold on --
He was 1000 meters out . Only one enemy sniper makes that shot .
Lex talionis ... Eye for eye , tooth for tooth .
We ' re going back .
Two clicks out . Lock and load .
For Biggles .
Courtyard is clear . Moving .
Some stronghold . Move .
Clear .
Somebody left in a hurry .
You sure we got the right address --
Contact --
Marc --
An AQI informant called in a tip . Biggles had just been shot . We were operating off emotion and -- we walked into an ambush .
But that ' s not what killed him . That letter did . That letter killed Marc . He let go and he paid the price for it .
If something ever happened to me -- you ' d meet someone else . You ' d be alright .
No .
I do it for you . To protect you .
Without this , there ' s nothing .
I could never live with myself .
I know .
Hey , buddy --
Chris ? Where are you ?
I ' m right here just give me a minute -- Just blind as a bat , huh ?
Yeah ... It fucking blows . They ' re gonna fix my face though .
That ' s good . Your face always needed a little fixing .
I heard you proposed ? Did you tell Kelly the diamond was from Zales ?
Naw , I bought a new one . A small one . Her dad helped me out .
Nice .
She wouldn ' t leave me , bro . I told her to go -- but she wouldn ' t leave . She ' s getting a raw fucking deal .
No she ' s not . How can you say that ? She ' s getting you . All four inches .
I ' m glad this happened to me and not you . No way you could ' ve handled it .
You ' re probably right .
They say you ' re the deadliest sniper in U . S . Military history .
Is that what they say ?
The bad guys fled up into to Sadr City .
You ' re not going back ?
We ' re gonna wall ` em in and hunt ` em down .
You don ' t have to do this .
Yes I do . You ' re my brother and they ' re going to pay for what they did to you .
Hooyah , Legend . Hooyah --
You have to ask the Navy . I lost count .
Any other Punishers here ?
Teams and shit .
I know . I visited him before I left . That fucker can ' t see shit .
Don ' t do it --
-- please God --
He rolls off the gun , gasping for air , biting back tears . After nearly a decade of war he ' s finally breaking down .
How deep ?
Is it Mustafa ?
What was that --
3rd floor . In a fruit locker . Breath racing . Hands tremoring . Electricity coursing through him .
No -- It came from behind us . We went the wrong way . He ' s south of the wall .
I got something . 1900 yards out .
Correction . 2100 yards out .
It ' s him .
Aim small . Aim small .
For Biggles .
Tango down .
He was on our boys and I took him out .
There are two ways onto the roof . We cover both stairways and conserve ammo .
Conserve --
Do it . Call in our coordinates .
-- you got four rounds .
Hey baby --
I ' m ready to come home . I ' m ready ...
-- I ' m coming home . Can you hear me ?
Go , go , let ' s move --
Stryker - 3 , what ' s your location --
Hold there ! We are 30 seconds out -- Go . Straight ahead . Go --
-- hello ?
Yeah , I got out early .
I ' m here , I ' m stateside .
I guess I just needed a minute .
Yeah , I know ... Me too . I ' m coming .
Yeah . I ' m good .
Okay .
That ' s not me .
I was just protecting my guys . They were trying to kill our soldiers and -- I ' m willing to stand before my creator and answer for every shot I took . The thing that haunts me are all the guys I couldn ' t save .
How ' s it feel ?
I heard you had a nice boot collection before the war and --
We gotta take care of our own .
Get ` em up , lil ' lady . Hands in the air .
Tell it to the judge .
We could lock the doors . They can ' t get out of the yard .
You ' re worth fighting for .
Yes , ma ' am . Right up the middle .
I meant what I said about locking the doors .
Not for four minutes .
It ' ll take half that . Then I got two minutes leftover just to look at you .
This Marine . His mom does parking at school and she asked for my help .
I gotta go do something but when I get back , okay ? But you have to let me win .
I should get going ...
Look after our women , Bubba . Love you , babe .
