Device functioned in front of the Colombian Consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived .
Who were the brass , and why were they here ?
No one ' s talking yet , but it smells high - level . There were Colombians and Americans in the cars . Three of ' em ate it . Guy on the phone --
-- is one of the survivors . Name ' s Brandt . C . I . A .
Check the surveillance cameras ?
We ' re pulling up the video now .
Where ' s N . Y . P . D . on this ?
They know it ' s ours . They ' re helping with shoe - leather .
We got two dead bystanders , a mother and four - year - old son . The father ' s over there with a leg wound . Guy ' s a lieutenant with the New York F . D .
Anybody talk to him yet ?
We ' ve been giving him room .
Gordy .
Me and Mike are here .
... I was late ... They shouldn ' t have been there ...
It ' s not your fault .
I need to see them .
No . You don ' t need to see ' em that way , Gordo .
Get those goddamn people outta here !
Put that tape out fifty more feet .
If he ' s not bleeding to death , leave him . He ' s not moving till they do .
Chalk ' em and move ' em .
We gotta get on this quick . I need to talk to him .
Mr . Pitt , if you can you tell me ... What ' d you see ?
What ' d I see ? I saw my family die .
This guy didn ' t do the bombing , Gordo . He ' s just trying to get the people who did .
I didn ' t see anything except the explosion .
I know this is hard . I ' m sorry I had to bother you .
We ' re gonna roll you to the hospital now and get that glass out . 17 . 49 ANGLE - PHIPPS 49 Walking back to the consulate . He approaches Brandt .

What got this place blown up ?
We ' ll have this discussion somewhere else more secure , after I get your clearance .
Whatever it takes . But I got a bomber in the wind . I need everything you can give me , and I need it now .
Hang on .
Dammit ...
Tell me about it .
How ' s he holding up ?
He ' s shut down ... We were hoping they ' d keep him here , and he wouldn ' t have to go home right away , but they ' re cutting him loose .
Want me to stay at home with him ?
Rookie ' s taking the first shift . I ' m just getting the schedule at the firehouse rearranged now .
Hey . Got here as fast as I could .
I know it sucks ... It really sucks ...
How ' s the leg ?
Cut ' s deep , but no major vessels were severed . He ' s got a load ' o silk holding it all together .
Just came over the police radio ... Consulate surveillance cameras caught the bomber in the act . He was disguised as a cop .
... I saw him ... I saw a cop .
Christ . Gordy ...
I gotta help ' em get the bastard .
How long before we have a secure computer network ?
An hour . They ' re building it now .
What do you got ?
Do it .
Run a total analysis . I want to know if this asshole ' s right or left - handed . I want everything you can get outta this film .
Any helpful information coming outta Colombia ?
Gordon Pitt ' s here . He says he saw a cop at the scene .
The cart was stolen from the Central Park Precinct yesterday .
That ' s him . That ' s the son of a bitch I bumped into .
The bomb ' s in the cart .
We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone . The guy doesn ' t have one in his hands here . Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him ?
... No .
How much time passed between then and the explosion ?
... Seconds ... Five , ten ...
We think maybe he got into the brown Ford . You see him then ?
All I cared about was getting to my wife and boy .
Guy still had enough time to get out a phone and dial it in .
of ending it ) We might need to call you in again to look at some photos .
... I touched him ...
I cannot speak for The Wolf or his actions . I would only repeat that the leftist guerrillas in Colombia are not terrorists but freedom fighters in a war being waged against them by the U . S . and Colombian governments . Governments who wish only to protect a system that lines the pockets of corrupt politicians and multi - national profiteers . The deaths of the woman and little boy are regrettable , but your government inflicts them all the time . Yugoslavia , Iraq ... You call it ' collateral damage '...
Rosetta , I said mustard on the side . You ' ll have to go back .
What do you want ?
Please ...
How ' s that for collateral damage ?
Mr . Ortiz - Dominguez has agreed not to press charges if you make full restitution .
I ' ve already paid . With my family .
Take care of it .
Gordy , this is Mike Brandt .
Mr . Pitt .
I ' m very sorry for your loss ... I lost people , too .
... Mike was in the motorcade that day ... He ' s the chief U . S . intelligence officer overseeing Colombia .
Don ' t worry , Mr . Pitt , we ' re gonna get the son - of - a - bitch .
You know where he is ?
We believe The Wolf ' s in hiding in an area of Colombia controlled by the E . L . C ., extreme Marxist guerrillas ... He thinks he ' s in a safe haven .
I know it ' s hard for you right now , Mr . Pitt . We ' re all sorry . But why don ' t you go home . We ' re taking care of things .
Here ' s my card . Call me any time .
What kind of twisted people do things like this ?
You interested in the big picture or all the unpleasant details ?
My family died because of what ' s going on down there . I want to know all I can .
Well , basically , the situation in Colombia sucks ...
... The government ' s been fighting different Marxists factions for over thirty - five years . For most of that time , it was winning ...
... Suddenly the guerrillas began chopping ' em up . High - tech weapons and equipment , well - trained troops , aggressive hit - and - run tactics , all financed by extortion , kidnapping and collecting taxes from dope growers . It ' s big money , and they put it to use ... 28 . 72 GORDY 72 3 . Gordy pins up various Colombia - related articles and pictures on the wall , including the surveillance camera still of The Wolf from the front page of The New York Post .
... The government got scared . In 1998 , to jump start peace talks , it gave a coalition of guerrilla groups temporary control over much of southern Colombia ... The first communist stronghold on an American continent ...
... But there ' ve been few talks and no peace . And the Colombian military can ' t get near the guerrilla zone , especially around the town of Caguan , where the E . L . C . kicks ass and takes no prisoners ...
... And that ' s where we come in . Supposedly , to help eliminate narcos operating in the guerrilla zone . But some well - informed people think that ' s just an excuse to hit the guerrillas themselves , since they ' re wrapped around the drug trade ... We ' re there , we ' re involved ... If we stay , the only real question is which Vietnam War we ' re gonna have . The one some feel we could ' ve won or the one we lost ...
... Bottom line ? The place is as dangerous as a snakepit . You ' ve got the different guerrilla groups , C . I . A ., F . B . I ., D . E . A ., Colombian military , U . S . military , right - wing death squads -- and the only thing they ' ve all managed to do is destroy a beautiful country and inflict suffering on the real people ... Hey , I ' m Colombian , and I ' ll never go back ...
Haven ' t heard from you in a couple days .
Been busy .
Yeah . I can see that .
E . L . C . attack platoon ... These assholes kill innocent people all the time in Colombia .

wall ) Ronnie couldn ' t find a fire with both hands .
Yeah . Let ' s go tell him that .
C ' mon , Gordo .
We aren ' t gonna let ' em drink all the beer , are we ?
Low on beer , Ronnie .
Yeah . I ' ll get more .
I ' ll tell you what ' ll be great : when you get back to work with us .
Yeah , how long is it ?
Week , two weeks ?
Shrinks say ten more days .
Like I said .
Fucking doorknob they put in temporary command ...
Morgan , the guy from 23 , right ?
What a jerkoff .
Even makes you look good , Gordo .
Hey , Gordy --
I ' m gone three weeks and this place falls apart .
The temp lieutenant put it out back , and Art hit it with his truck .
We ' re having problems with the portable pump again , too .
Who backed over that ?... My tools still here ?
Upstairs in your locker .
Figured you guys would ' ve sold my stuff at a yard sale by now . 33 . 81 INT . SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT 81 Art ' s sleeping . Gordy opens his locker . There are old pictures of Anne and Matt still taped inside . He glances at them quickly , then pulls out his tools .
You ever stay on one channel long enough to hear what they ' re saying ?
Go back ! Go back !
What ?
This guy , Quaddafi , that Bin Laden ... We never get these assholes .
... Senator , the failure of one operation shouldn ' t cause your committee to question financing everything else we ' re doing down there ...
... I know it looks bad , and I appreciate your support . Together we ' ll get it done ... Yeah . ' bye . Updegraf ) Without his father ' s money , that asshole ' d be keeping bees for a living ... What ?
No .
I don ' t need it .
Tell him not to bother .

Is there a problem ?
Says so right there in my passport .

How far ' s Colombia ?
Aqui ? Colombia ?...
Gracias .
Find your fucking leak ?
All due respect , Noel , it ' s not likely ... And we don ' t need the whole world looking into what we ' re doing down here ... We find the son - of - a - bitch again , we ' re bypassing protocols ...
Jesus Christ ...
What , he thinks he can get The Wolf himself ?

Habla Ingles ?... Que pasa ?
Where are all of you going ?
None of these people have papers ?
No !

You ' ll be okay ... You ' ll be okay .
Guerrilla bastards .
No ! Alto !
Hey , yo , dude , here ' s a seat , man !
No , that ' s okay --
I was hoping for someone I could communicate with .
Only room ' s at the back near the bano , and I ' d advise against it , unless you like poop .
Philip Armstrong . Assiniboia , Sasketchewan , Canada . Deerborn Heavy Equipment .
... Gordy Pitt .
Hey , howya doing ? I love Germany .
Austria . American now .
I love America . Never been to Austria . Where from in America would that be ?
New York City .
I don ' t like New York City . Buildings ' re too big . What kinda work you in ?
Coffee . I buy beans .
Can ' t drink caffeine . Makes my stomach do the rumba . I like that commercial guy with the sombrero and the mule , though . Headed upstream , eh ? Where to ?
Caguan .
... You ' ve never been to Caguan , eh ?
How do you know ?
' Cause no one in their right mind would ever go back . Caguan ' s in the guerrilla zone run by the E . L . C . E . L . C . as in ' Extra Loathsome Communists .' They don ' t care , and they kill . I ' m going there myself . But I have a ' get outta jail free ' card .
E . L . C . travel pass . I can go anywhere I want . explanation ) Everyone needs equipment fixed .
If you don ' t have one of these , you don ' t want to be up there , Gordy .
Por favor .
Con mucho gusto .
Got kids , eh ?
That little kid and I had a nice , long snooze ... We ' re almost to Mompos . Beautiful country .
It better be . A lotta people ' re dying for it .
Y ' know , I haven ' t noticed one darn body floating downstream this whole trip , have you ?
I was thinking ... Maybe we could travel together into Caguan . You could show me around .
Pass is only good for one person , if that ' s your idea , which I think it is ... Besides , I can ' t risk traveling around up there in the company of a big gringo with a dumb - ass cover story about coffee beans .
I ' ve got money . I ' ll buy the pass from you .
I ' ve worked too hard for it . And you don ' t have that kind of money on you .
I ' ll be getting some life insurance money --
It ' s all cash and carry down here , Gordy .
Mompos ... You want to have some fun , we ' ll hook up later . I always schedule a stopover . To sample the local wares and such . Life can be what you make it here on the frontier .
No , thanks .
Gotta get off the boat anyway . Mompos is the last stop . From here into the guerrilla zone you can only travel by panga ... If you change your mind , I ' ll be at the Tropicale later . It ' s a gringo bar . Just follow the cockroaches .
Sicarios . Death squads . Avoid those dudes at all costs . 54 . 128 SAME SCENE - FEW MOMENTS LATER 128 The ferry pulls up to the dock . The dock street is a culture clash of shanty bars and Amazon Indian traders , of big - wheel SUVs and mule carts . There ' s a definite air of menace .
Federales are looking for someone .
Why ?
I never met a nose I couldn ' t hang a spoon on .
Yahtzee !
Police catch you trying to steal my hat , you asshole ?!
Fucking hat thief !
Get outta here --
That stun gun wasn ' t cool .
Haven ' t peed my pants in a real long time .
You shouldn ' t have helped me .
Yeah , well , I guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves .
So what the hell did you do to land us in here ? And don ' t jerk me around , eh ?
The Wolf killed my wife and son in New York .
... Oh , you ' re that guy , eh ? I ' m sorry , man ... And what , you came down here to even things out ?
Did you even have a plan ?
Yeah . Go to Caguan , find The Wolf and kill him .
E . L . C . Beat . Armstrong sees the look on Gordy ' s face . By way of a warning --
If you can ' t kill them , don ' t even talk to them .
Enjoy your trip ?
We asked you to leave it to us .
And you guys still haven ' t got him .
It ' s not over yet ... The guys next door are in The Wolf ' s elite bodyguard unit . Where he goes , they go . We ' re gonna ask questions . And we ' re gonna get answers ... And you ' re staying right here till our bomber ' s dead .
Don ' t breathe .
You ' re not running through the fire , eh ?
Close your mouth .
I ' ll find a boat to take us upriver .
No . I told you . The pass is only good for one person . And you ' re too dangerous to travel with .
It hasn ' t been there since we landed .
Aw , hell ... I was through with this place anyway ...
I ' ll call ahead and tell Felix I ' m not coming , and you ' re my replacement . He ' ll meet you in Caguan and take you to the plantation ... What do you know about diesel engines ?
All the fire trucks are diesels .
You ' ll have to be Austrian , eh ? They hate Americans . Name ' s gotta change , too , in case they ' re watching the news . It ' ll buy you a little time to look around Caguan . But you ' ll never find The Wolf .
Heinrich Beckmann .
Huh ?
My Austrian name .
Luck got you this far . But up there , luck doesn ' t make it . I hope you know you ' re gonna die .
Beckmann .
Yeah .
Come with me .
Armstrong should have called sooner . We don ' t like changes here ... If I didn ' t need the equipment fixed , I ' d send you back .
But now we have to see the E . L . C . Supervisor for Caguan .
In Mompos .
He was arrested in Ecuador . He got drunk and fooled around with a police officer ' s wife .
We need to fix the equipment . We have delivery deadlines to meet .
Si . Gracias .
The Supervisor made you my responsibility ... You don ' t go anywhere without me , you understand ?
No problemo .
The E . L . C . guards your coffee beans ?
... Coffee beans ? Shit . Armstrong didn ' t tell you much ...
The problem ' s with the diesel generators . The sons - of - bitches keep breaking down .
We ' re using portables to keep production going , but they don ' t supply enough power to the heat lamps , and we have to dry a lot of ... ' coffee beans .'
We can fix anything , but these keep dying on us ... You ' ll start now . I ' ll have tools brought to you . Armstrong ' s a magician with them . Let ' s hope you have his skill .
Well ?
I can ' t work with these pieces of junk .
Junk ? These generators cost a fortune .
Then treat them that way .
Armstrong always fixes them .
Armstrong wants your money . He makes them work , but he doesn ' t fix them ... To do this right , we gotta order parts from Europe . In the meantime , I can make something temporary . There must be a machine shop in town .
... Yes .
Let ' s go .
Let ' s get moving .
I ' m thirsty . How about you ? Want to get something to drink ?
We have to get back .
I ' ve been working all day out in the sun . I need a drink ... nice cold beer ? How about it ? I saw a bar in town .
With the spare parts , I ' ll have the generators running in two hours ... We have time for a couple beers .
Okay . Just a beer . Maybe two .
This is mine . This is the reason I come here ... right , Berta ? Me amas ?
... She ' s hot , isn ' t she ?
Yeah .
Armstrong said to watch my butt around here . I guess the fucking Americans come down and shoot everyone all the time .
Especially now , since the bomb in New York .
Yeah , I heard about it . Who did it ?
The Wolf , and they ' ll never catch him .
Ever see him ?
Once .
Where ?
If you know too much around here , it can get you killed .
Tell me what doesn ' t get you killed around here .
We ' d better get back , huh ?
... Shit . It ' s late .
You ' re too drunk . I ' ll drive .
One day , I ' m going to screw Berta .
... I ' ll take her to a small restaurant ... We ' ll have lobster and drink lots of wine ... I ' ll get her drunk ... We ' ll drive home ... I ' ll carry her inside ... I ' ll kiss her ... And then , I ' ll screw her in my bed ...
... And when I am done screwing her , she ' ll never want to look at another man again ...
What the fuck are you doing ?!
Hey , easy ... What ' s the problem ?
You ' re going the wrong goddamn way !
I am ?... Looks different in the dark ...
Turn around !
You drive where I say ... Or the Supervisor will have us both shot .
It ' s afternoon . Yesterday , you said it would only take two more hours .
I have this one ready to go .
What about the other one ?
I just need another part from town , and it ' s five more minutes .
... Shit . Fine . Let ' s go .
Why ' re you bringing the tool box ?
The old part ' s in there . I need to match it , and it ' s all greasy .
Berta working today ?
Ha ! Puta !
You as thirsty as I am ?
No .
We can ' t stop for one beer ?
There ' s beer at the plantation .
There ' s no Berta at the plantation . I like drinking beer around pretty girls , not a bunch of guys with automatic rifles .
To hell with Berta .
What happened ? Last night you were in love with her .
... I had a dream ... I fed her lobster , got her drunk , and she rejected me for another man . Dreams tell the future .
... That wasn ' t a dream , that was the alcohol talking ... You saying two men can ' t go have a beer and look at women ' s breasts because of pink elephants ?... Nothing makes any sense down here .
Go ahead and shoot me , and you fix the goddamn generator . Part ' s in the back .
You know I ' m your man , baby .
I have to piss .
Yo trabajo con Felix . Felix -- -- la cantina . Con Berta .
Are you trying to get us both killed ?
I went for a walk . I figured you wanted to be alone with Berta .
in Spanish ) I ' ll make sure he ' s on a shorter leash .
Shit ...
You ' re working all night , Beckmann . That generator gets fixed , and you ' re out of my hair in the morning .
That make you happy ?
Where ' s my money ?
You ' ll get it in the morning . 82 . 216 INT . HACIENDA - STOREROOM - NIGHT 216 Felix yanks the dangling cord and turns on the lights . The room ' s a mess . All kinds of rubbish . There ' s a washtub sink . There ' s a cot .
This where Armstrong stays ?
This is where you stay ... A boat will take you down river at seven .
Come on , baby ... come on , baby ...
Just in time ...
He can ' t be far . You ' ll catch --
No ! Stop ! Alto !
Get back !
You killed my wife and son --
... Who are you ?
... His wife ?
Why feed me ? Why not just kill me ?
... Thanks .
I ' m not one of them . I ' m here for my own reasons .
Why are you still here ?
I ' m not like him .
He kills innocent people . He ' s planning to kill more .
It ' s well - sited ... can ' t surprise ' em , so you gotta outgun ' em ... So that ' s what we ' re gonna do .
We ' re not just gonna hit it , we ' re gonna wipe if off the globe . Cats , rats , dogs and mice . If it ' s moving , it ' s dead .
I don ' t care what the Puerto Ricans say . look ) Which part of the word ' war ' don ' t you understand ? Our mission down here isn ' t just about catching The Wolf .
He was told not to be here ... The first choppers ' ll hit it at 2200 .
What ?
Got any good news ?
Only good thing down here ... Put everyone on red till tomorrow night . And then , I don ' t care if there ' s a typhoon , I want those fucking rotors turning .
The United States ? Another bomb ?
Where ?
Where ?
Where in Washington ?
Which building ?
We can ' t let it happen .
We ' d never make it .
How many more kids have to die ? And for what ?
If you don ' t stop it , you ' re as much to blame as he is .
It ' s time to make The Wolf howl .
How do we get out ?
Go !
You okay ?
Under the water ! Uno , dos , tres ...
They couldn ' t have made it this far . Go back upstream .
Hang on . We just have to keep floating a little bit more ...
You were shot .
We gotta get you outta the river .
Esta bien . Esta bien .
You ' re lucky .
Can you walk ?
How do you say ' hello '?
Yo soy Americano ... Gordy Pitt ... Gordy Pitt ...
F . B . I .' s on the radio . Tell ' em everything you know .
They both get asylum . And she needs a medic .
On the plane .
What about the asylum ?
They ' ll get it . But she ' s in my custody till we ' re done with her .
He wasn ' t even there .
These buildings best match what you described to us .
That ' s okay . We ' ll keep trying .
Double up on public venues : museums , theaters , transport ... Put in all the extra undercover we can .
Where ' re we going ?
Inter - agency headquarters for our efforts in Latin America .
It ' s secure , and we can coordinate all departments here .
My people will debrief you in another room ... We ' ll take the boy to a safe house across the street ... He ' ll be well cared for .
That ' s okay .
I was underground . I couldn ' t see anything .
No .
Union Station .
Put it under total surveillance . Get a bomb team in there with dogs . Make ' em seeing - eye dogs if you have to . And pull whatever security video they have for the last two days .
Why not just shut it down ?
If we spook him , we don ' t know what his secondary target ' ll be .
That ' s him , isn ' t it ?
He was there yesterday . Just stood there and left ... So far , the dogs haven ' t found anything , so maybe we ' re ahead of him .
What ' s he waiting for ?
Are you okay ?
In here .
Get copies of this freeze frame to all the undercover people and the sniper teams .
You got it .
And nobody caps him until we get that bomb tagged . After that , I don ' t give a shit what happens to him .
He always hid his face . Why ' s he giving us a clear picture now ?
Feeling better ?
Escort her .
I ' ve told you all I know .
What ' s that ?
Eleven .
She was killed in Guatemala .
Shit ...
We think the bomb was triggered by a cell phone .
Did you see a cell phone when you ran into him ?
No .
Where ' s Selena ?!
She went to see her son .
She ' s lying ! She ' s The Wolf !
Everybody out ! Clear this floor ! Now !
You killed them .
They were my family .
The killing ends here .
No . You don ' t understand .
Hold us both till the police get here . 131 . 410 ANOTHER ANGLE 410 It ' s too late . Selena stomps a heel into the Guard ' s knee , crushing it , then twists the gun from his hands . She points it at him and pulls the trigger , and ...
We got the bitch .
You ' re no better than she is .
It ' ll be good to get you back .
It ' s good to be home .
