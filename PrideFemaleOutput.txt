My dear Mr Bennet, have you heard that Netherfield Park is let at last? We follow Elizabeth into the house, but still overhear her parents' conversation.
 Have you heard? A Mr Bingley, a young man from the North of England, has come down on Monday in a chaise and four.
With five thousand a year! naive of the girls), joins them at the door.
Goodness!
- and he's single to be sure!
What a fine thing for our girls!
My dear Mr Bennet, how can you be so tiresome! You know that he must marry one of them.
- So you must go and visit him at once.
Oh, yes, Papa.
Please, Papa!
You have?
when?
â€¢ How can you tease me, Mr Bennet. You have no compassion for my poor nerves?
Is he amiable?
Is he handsome?
He's sure to be handsome.
 With five thousand a year, it would not matter if he had a big pink face.
So will he come to the ball tomorrow?
 I have to have your spotted muslin, please!
I need it!
- if you do, I'll lend you my green slippers. Mr Bennet winks at Elizabeth and turns to Mary, a serious, somewhat pedantic young woman.
Society has claims on us all, Papa. As long as I have my mornings to myself, I consider an interval of recreation and â€¢ amusement as quite desirable. Elizabeth laughs.
I literally can't breathe its so tight.
My toes hurt. Elizabeth and Jane are a little apart from their family. Jane looks breathtaking.
â€¢ Well, if every man in this room does not end the evening completely in love with you then I am no judge of beauty.
Or men.
Oh, they are far too easy to judge.
They are not all bad.
Humourless poppycocks, in my limited experience.
One of these days, Lizzie, someone will catch your eye and then you'll have to watch your tongue.
And eat my hat. She stops speaking. And stares. A dazzling group enters the room: George Bingley, 25, a good hearted soul but â€¢ prone to bumbling embarrassment when his enthusiasms get the better of him, his sister Caroline, 23, a victim of every latest fashion, counting herself superior to most company she encounters, and finally, Mr Fitzwilliam Darcy, 27, dashing, brooding with an introversion which could be misconstrued as hauteur. They are dressed in the highest fashion. Darcy surveys the hall. He catches Elizabeth's eye. She stares, with a kind of surprised shock. Jane notices and looks at Darcy. He turns away.
Luckily, you are not wearing a hat. A hush falls as the local people turn to stare. The newcomers - creatures from another world - make quite a stir.
So which of the painted peacocks is our Mr Bingley?
He is on the right, and on the left is his sister.
And the person with the disagreeable expression?
That is his good friend, Mr Darcy.
Poor soul.
On the contrary, he has ten thousand a year and owns half of Derbyshire.
It is a pleasure. I have two others but
How do you like it here in Hertfordshire, Mr Bingley?
The library at Netherfield, I've heard, is one of the finest in the country.
I wish I read more, but there always seems so many other things to do.
Mama! The regiment is arriving next week!
And will be here for the whole winter! Mrs Forster told us!
They're going to be stationed in the village!
Do you dance Mr Darcy?
officers! Lots of officers!
How will we meet them?
It's easy. You just walk up and down in front of them and drop something. Lydia pantomimes the actions for Kitty.
â€¢ They pick it up. You say 'oh thank you sir' and blush prettily and then you're introduced!
Oh Mr Bennet! I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself, and if a smart young colonel with six thousand a year should want one of my girls I shall not say nay to him. Mr Darcy overhears this. Profoundly embarrassed, Lizzie moves away.
7 That dress becomes her, does it not. 7 â€¢ Though of course my Jane needs little help from couturiers. Elizabeth wanders through the throng. She looks at Bingley and Jane ending the dance - she is coy and demure, he clearly smitten -
Ignore him, Lizzie, he is such a disagreeable man it would be a misfortune to be liked by him.
Don't worry. I would not dance with him for half of Derbyshire.
â€¢ Yes! I adore her.
It is a pity she is not more handsome.
Mama!
But Lizzie will never admit she is plain.
Oh, Mama, please!
When she was only fifteen there was a gentleman so much in love with her that I was sure he would make her an offer. However, he did write her some very pretty verses.
 And so ended their affection. I wonder â€¢ who first discovered the power of poetry in driving away love?
Of a fine, stout love it may. Everything nourishes what is strong already. But if it is only a thin, slight sort of inclination, I'm convinced that one good sonnet will starve it away entirely. Darcy looks at Elizabeth with surprise. A glimmering of interest.
Oh dancing, of course. Even if ones partner is barely tolerable. She gives him a dazzling smile. Darcy looks startled. He has no idea she heard him. He blushes.
Mr Bingley is just what a young man ought to be. Sensible, good humoured -
Handsome, conveniently rich -
You know perfectly well I do not believe marriage should be driven by thoughts of money.
I agree entirely, only the deepest love will persuade me into matrimony, which is why I will end up an old maid.
Do you really believe he liked me, Lizzie?
Jane, he danced with you most of the night.
I was flattered, I must admit. I did not expect such a compliment.
That is one great difference between us. Compliments always take you by surprise. Well, Mr Bingley is certainly very amiable, and I give you leave to like him. You've liked many a stupider person.
Lizzie!
You're a great deal too apt to like people in general, you know. All the world is good and agreeable in your eyes.
Mr Darcy? I could more easily forgive his vanity had he not wounded mine. But no matter. I doubt we shall ever speak again. She blows out the candle.
And then he danced the third with Miss Lucas. Poor thing, it is a shame she is not more handsome. The fourth with a Miss King of little standing. And the fifth again with Jane.
Oh, Mr Bennet! Anybody would think the girls looked forward to a grand inheritance. Elizabeth rolls her eyes at Mr Bennet, they've heard this speech many times before.
As you well know, Mr Bennet, when you die, which may in fact be very soon, our girls will be left without a roof over their head nor a penny to their name.
Oh Mother, please! It's ten in the morning. Mrs Hill enters the room and interrupts Mrs Bennet's â€¢ babbling.
Praise the Lord! We are saved. Mrs Hill gives the letter to Jane.
It is from Miss Bingley. Mrs Bennet is stopped in her tracks.
This is most unfortunate.
I didn't think he was so good looking anyway.
Can I take the carriage?
Certainly not my dear, you will go to Netherfield on horse back.
Horseback?! Mrs Bennet leaves with a secret smile on her lips.
Ah, good... The housekeeper, Mrs Hill, who is with her, looks bemused at her mistress's reaction.
Excellent. Now she will have to stay the night. Exactly as I predicted.
Though I don't think, mama, you can reasonably take credit for making it rain. Let's hope she hasn't caught her death before she gets there.
â€¢ "And my kind friends will not hear of me returning home until I am better -- but do not be alarmed excepting a sore throat, a. fever, and a headache there is nothing wrong with me." This is ridiculous.
People do not die of colds.
Though she might well perish with the shame of having such a mother. Mr Bennet laughs.
I am going to Netherfield at once.
Nonsense, the horse is with Jane. And the girls took the carriage to town.
Then I will walk there. We should not leave Jane alone in her condition.
Walk! You will not be fit to be seen by the time you get there.
I will be fit for Jane which is all I care about.
I'm so sorry. How is my sister?
Jane! Jane's face lights up. Elizabeth kisses her.
Lizzie! Oh, your face is so cold. They're being so kind to me, I feel such a terrible imposition.
Don't worry. I don't know who is more pleased at your being here, Mama or Mr Bingley. Bingley comes in having attended to the doctor.
Well, my dear, its all going according to plan. He's half in love with her already!
Mr Bingley! And he doesn't mind that she hasn't a penny, for he has enough for the two of them. Suddenly a distant trumpet sounds, dogs bark. The militia are arriving. Lydia and Kitty rush past. They are dressed up to the nines to greet the officers. Mrs Bennet's face lights up.
Goodness! You must comprehend a great deal in the idea.
i am no longer surprised at your knowing only six accomplished women. I rather wonder now at your knowing any.
â€¢ I never saw such a woman. She would certainly be a fearsome thing to behold. Pause. Darcy goes back to his letter. Caroline Bingley picks up a book. Pauses. Puts it down. she walks over to
And it's a small kind of accomplishment, I suppose. Darcy meets Lizzie's eye, briefly. He goes back to his letter-writing. More walking up and down. Caroline Bingley turns to Darcy.
Our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it.
We could always tease him.
Are you too proud, Mr Darcy? And would you consider that a fault?
For we're trying to find a fault in you.
â€¢ Oh dear, I cannot tease you about that. What a shame, for I dearly love to laugh.
Jane, do you think you might feel well enough to leave today?
What an excellent room you have sir. Such expensive furnishings. I hope you intend to stay here, Mr Bingley.
But I assure you there is quite as much going on in the country as there is in the town.
Indeed Mania, I think Mr Darcy merely meant there were not such a variety of people to be met in the country as there are in town, which you must acknowledge to be true.
Mr Bingley, is it true that you have promised to hold a ball here at Netherfield?
It would be an excellent way to meet new friends. You could invite the militia.
Oh do hold a ball.

I think a Ball is a perfectly irrational way to gain new acquaintance. It would be better if conversation instead of dancing were the order of the day.
Thank you, Mary.
Really, I don't know how to thank you. Bingley beams bashfully. He can't take his eyes off her.
 Thank you for such stimulating company. It has been most instructive.
Mr Darcy.
What a high and mighty man that Mr Darcy is, quite eaten up with pride.
I can't believe it, there must be a thousand of them. Leading the one troupe of Militia is Wickham a very handsome blonde officer, Lydia spots him and swoons.
Please, drive on.
Who's to inherit?
When?
But why?
 They are. Jane, Lizzie and Mary enter.
Mr Collins, we are perfectly able to keep a cook.
Does she have any family?
Do these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are they the result of previous study? Jane kicks Elizabeth under the table. Elizabeth tries not to laugh at Mr Collins' answer.
Believe me, no one would suspect your manners to be practised. The girls look at one another.
Mr Collins, unfortunately it is incumbent on me to hint that the eldest Miss Bennet is - very soon to be engaged.
But Miss Elizabeth next to her in both age and beauty would make anyone an excellent partner. Do not you agree, Mr Collins? Mr Collins looks through the doorway at Elizabeth
Oh no! Mx Collins spots them and darts through a door in the garden wall and hurries towards the bridge to meet them.
Quick! This way! She pulls Jane across the duck board spanning the moat, through the house and out the front. Mr Collins doubles back and follows them into the house. The girls are no-where to be seen. He looks around, puzzled.
  Â€¢ We've lost him. They slow down to a walk. And then stop. outside the milliner's shop the incorrigible Lydia and Kitty are chatting to Wickham, the dashing young officer we spotted earlier. He is utterly gorgeous - slim, handsome, tousled hair. The perfect romantic hero.
Kitty? Lydia! She and Jane join them.
We just happened to be looking for some ribbon, didn't we, Kitty?
He picked up Lydia's gloves!
He's a lieutenant! Wickham bows.
Oh yes!
 Only a man truly confident of himself would admit that.
So you don't mind being laughed at?
It is a somewhat sterile quality, is it not, to be aware of ones importance in the world.
Lizzie, please lend me some money!
 Â€¢ You already owe me a considerable sum, Liddy.
No! Please - Mr Wickham! - Wickham gives Elizabeth a smile and moves away to the counter.
You're too generous.
It all adds up.
Will you be stationed here all winter, Mr Wickham?
Lizzie - look! They stop. Jane's face lights up.
Mr Bingley ! It is indeed Bingley, riding towards them. He is accompanied by Darcy. â€¢ Bingley jumps off his horse and hurries over to Jane. His open, friendly face is filled with delight.
Lydia!
She is! Elizabeth pays no attention to the following conversation, instead she is looking at Darcy who, in turn, is staring at Wickham. They both obviously recognize each other and look very uncomfortable.
- when, then?
Be sure to invite Mr Wickham. Darcy turns and rides off without a word.
Lydia, you can't just say that -
Yes, white, they must be white.
White is the only colour to be worn this season.
Will you be attending the Netherfield ball, Mr Wickham?
About a month. Are you acquainted with, Mr Darcy?
As much as I could ever wish to be. I have spent four days in the same house as him, and I think him very disagreeable.
I think I shall take a little air. She rises and walks through the room towards a balcony. As she passes the other tables we follow and witness snippets of their conversations.
 It seems Mr Wickham has met with universal approval. Though Lizzie looks singularly pleased with him.
At the moment she has more suitors than sense. Charlotte looks over at Mr Collins. Elizabeth passes Sir William's side of the table.
 Â€¢ Really I need to take some air. Mr Collins makes his way to join Elizabeth.
Please, Mr Collins, I'd be happy if you'd
â€¢ I hope your plans in favor of Meryton will not be affected by your difficult relations with the gentleman we were just speaking of.
I must ask you Mr Wickham, what is the manner of your disapproval of Mr Darcy?
How so?
Aggghh!
Breathe in! We move to the quieter preparations of Jane and Elizabeth. This conversation has been going on for some time.
 - I still think there must have been a misunderstanding.
0 How could Mr Darcy do such a thing? I will discover the truth from Mr Bingley at the ball this evening.
If it is not true let Mr Darcy contradict it himself. But until he does, I hope never to encounter him.
Poor, unfortunate Mr Wickham.
On the contrary, he is twice the man Darcy is.
And lets hope for you a rather more willing dancer. Jane leaves Elizabeth, at the mirror, taking very particular care of her makeup. she smil6s to herself.
And so am I.
â€¢ No, no not at all. Admiring the splendor of the ball.
It is lovely, Mr Bingley. Bingley and Jane move off leaving Elizabeth with Mrs Bennet and others. While Mrs Bennet talks we focus on Elizabeth searching the sea of red coats.

 Â€¢ Have you seen Mr Wickham. She shakes her head.
Perhaps he is in the ballroom. They both walk into the ball room. We pull back to reveal a sea of dancers. Wickham is nowhere to be seen. Jane appears and catches Elizabeths arm.
He's not here. Apparently otherwise detained. The disappointment is palpable on Elizabeth's face.
Detained? Mr Collins arrives, breathless. He smiles eagerly at Elizabeth.
Oh. I didn't think you danced, Mr Collins.
Apparently Your Mr Wickham has been called on some business to town, though my informer told me he would have been less inclined to be engaged had it not been for the presence at Netherfield of a certain gentleman. Jane indicates towards where Darcy stands watching them.
That gentleman barely warrants the name. The dance leads Elizabeth back to Mr Collins.
You may. Darcy walks away.
What was I thinking? Have I no presence of mind?l
I dare say you will find him very agreeable, Lizzie.
I do love a Sarabande.
It is your turn to say something, Mr Darcy - I talked about the dance, now you ought to remark on the size of the room or the number of couples.
That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and bye I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public ones. But for now we may be silent.
We are each of an unsocial, taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say something that will - amaze the whole room, and be handed down to posterity with all the eclat of a proverb. So a little lubrication to avoid embarrassment might be advantageous.
Very mild weather we've been having.
Yes, we often walk to Meryton - it is a great opportunity to meet new people. In fact when you met us we had just had the pleasure of forming a new acquaintance.
He has been so unlucky as to lose your friendship. I remember hearing you once say that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very cautious, I suppose, as to its being created?
To make out your character, Mr Darcy.
very little. The dancefinishes.
His lack of trustworthiness and descent appear by your account to be the same thing,
I believe so.
But sir -
 He is? Mr Collins starts making his way determinedly towards Darcy.
Aren't you going to do something?
But they asked for another song. Mr Bennet shuts the lid.
Perhaps my family have made a competition to see who can expose themselves to the most ridicule.
Well, at least Bingley has not noticed.
â€¢ Yes. I think he likes her very much.
But does she like him? There are few of us who are secure enough to be really in love without proper encouragement. Bingley likes her enormously but might not do more if she does not help him on.
She is just shy and modest. If he does not perceive her regard he is a fool.
We are all fools in love. He does not know her character as we do. She should move fast. Snap him up. There is plenty of time for us to get to know them after we're married - Elizabeth looks over the dancefloor to see Lydia dancing with a soldier. she's a little drunk, and very flirtatious. He says something; she shrieks with laughter.
I have never had such a good time in my life. Mr Bingley you must have such a ball once a month at least. Caroline who is standing with her brother, yawns ostentatiously.
Mother. I really think it is time to go.
Don't be impertinent. our hosts are perfectly happy with our company, are you not, Mr Bingley? I hope I can entice you to Longbourn to sample our hospitality. We would make sure you had 3 or 4 courses at least. She holds out her glass for a top up and carries on.
Really. This is enough. Darcy looking down at Elizabeth from a staircase. He turns and walks away.
Allowing for new carriages, dresses etcetera, etcetera. We will be having a wedding here at Netherfield in less than three months, if you ask me. Mr Bennet? Mr Bennet! 5o INT. BREAKFAST ROOM - LONGBOURNE - DAY. 50 The Bennets eat in silence. Jane.yawns. Mrs Bennet moans - she is hungover. Mr Collins comes in in a state of agitation. They look at him. He sits, hesitates, then
Oh! Yes. Certainly - Lizzy would be very happy indeed. Please -- go ahead. No time like the present. Everyone. Out. Mr Collins would like a private audience with your sister. Everyone looks in amazement.
Wait. I beg you. Mr Collins can have nothing to say to me.that anybody need not hear.
No. Nonsense, Lizzy. I desire you-will stay where you are. Everyone else, to the drawing room. Mr Bennet.
Now! Mrs Bennet makes sure everyone leaves, winks at Mr Collins then shuts the door before Elizabeth has time to do anything. Elizabeth looks at Mr Collins who looks at her in earnest. There is a horrible pause of intense embarrassment.
Mr Collins -
You are too hasty, sir! You forget that I have made no answer.
Sir, I am honoured by your proposal, but regret I must decline it.
Mr Collins, I am perfectly serious. You could not make me happy and I'm convinced I'm the last woman in the world who could make you happy.
Mr Collins -
Sir! I am not the sort of female to torment a respectable man. Please understand me - I cannot accept you! Elizabeth storms out of the room and out of the house. Mrs Bennet crashes in through another door, hot on the tail of Elizabeth.
Declined indeed! The headstrong, foolish
- we shall have this little hiccup dealt with immediately, Mr Collins. Mrs Bennet goes chases after Elizabeth. Mr Collins watches through a window as Elizabeth is chased by her mother.
Oh Mr Bennet. We are all in a uproar. You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr Collins, for she vows she will not have him.
Mr Collins, Mr Collins has proposed to Lizzie. But Lizzy declares she will not have him, and now the danger is Mr Collins may not have Lizzy.
Speak to Lizzy. They march to find Elizabeth.
Tell her that you insist upon them marrying.
You will have this house!
You'll save your sisters from destitution!
Go back now and say you've changed your mind!
Think of your family!
Mr Bennet, say something!
Yes, or I shall never see her again?
 - who will maintain you when your father is dead?
 MR BENNET'  Thank you, papa. Elizabeth turns around and walks into the drawing room.
Oh, ungrateful child! I shall never speak to her again! Not that I have much pleasure in talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have no inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer... She jabbers on but her voice fades. We're with Jane, re- reading the letter.
What's wrong, Jane? Close on Jane's pale face. She's staring at the letter.
 But it is always so. Those who complain are never pitied...
I don't understand. What would take him from Netherfield? Why would he not know when he was to return?
â€¢ I have no reserves from you. Jane passes Elizabeth the letter.
"Mr Darcy is impatient to see his sister and we are scarcely less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgina Darcy has her equal for beauty, elegance and accomplishments, so much so I must hope to hereafter call her my sister. It is my duty to indulge you in no hope in this respect for your own self."
Is that not clear enough?
Miss Bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and is gone with him to persuade him otherwise.
But I know her to be incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone.
â€¢ He loves you, Jane. Do not give up. Go to our aunt and uncle's in London.
Give my love to my sister. And try not to be so much of a burden, dear. Jane's carriage moves away and the family wave. Mr Bennet talks to Elizabeth.
 I'm sure that will cheer her up,Papa.
Thank you, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We must not all expect Jane's good fortune.
My dear Elizabeth, I've come here to tell you the news.
â€¢ What news?
 Mr Collins and I are engaged to be married. A stunned pause.
Engaged?
 You don't mind, do you?
No, no... Of course not.
He asked for my hand this morning .and I accepted him. Elizabeth looks quite faint. Charlotte sits on the bed. Elizabeth, after a pause, sits down beside her.
I can see you're surprised - coming so soon after his wishing to marry you...
 No...
I'm not a romantic, you know. I ask only a comfortable home, and considering Mr Collin's character, and situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can hope for.
And that's all you expect?
For women in our situation, what choice is there?
 Don't speak like that, Charlotte!
â€¢ - to become an old maid, at best tolerated, at worst a burden, dependent on the kindness of others? Or to seek the protection of marriage.
And we only have two choices?
Yes. An appalled silence. Elizabeth gazes at her closest friend. Charlotte has recovered herself. she now looks cool and composed - unnervingly so.
You can still change your mind, Charlotte.
I'm twenty-seven years old. We hear the sound of the militia drums...
It's too dreadful! They're leaving for Brighton.
All of them?
They got the call this morning.
Not a word of warning! Lydia wails. Elizabeth searches the red coats for Wickham. She spots him, he glances across at her, she gives a pathetic wave and he's gone. Lydia and Kitty chase the last of the officers, leaving Elizabeth alone. She walks into the post office.
It could not be worse. I have been invited to possibly the very last place on earth I would like to go.
My dear, I think our guest is tired after her journey. Come on, Lizzie, let's get some tea.
â€¢ We shall not be disturbed here, for this parlour is for my own particular use.
 What's happened?
 Has the pig escaped? Lizzie joins her at the window. outside in the lane, Mr Collins stands, bowing, at a carriage.
Its all right. Its just Lady Catherine.
I have not heard from Mr Wickham since the regiment left for Brighton, but I am informed by Lydia who keeps a breast of all matters military that he does very well.
Oh Lizzie. we hear Mr Collins rushing back into the house, and running up the stairs.
I am, your ladyship.
 It's very kind of you to ask us to dine, Lady Catherine. Lady Catherine ignores her.
â€¢ Mr Darcy! What are you doing here?
Yes, madam, I had the pleasure of meeting him in Hertfordshire. Darcy's friend Fitzwilliam, a much more easy-going chap, introduces himself.
Really? Miss Bingley will be disappointed to hear that. whispers to charlotte) What a sickly, cross little thing! Oh yes, they should suit each other very well. Charlotte smiles back, a little fearfully. She's more intimidated by Rosings than Elizabeth is, and indeed has more at stake. 68 INT. DINING ROOM - ROSINGS - NIGHT. f 9 The dining room is laid for a very grand dinner -- footmen waiting, thousands of candles.
They are, thank you.
A little, ma'am, and very poorly.
No, not at all.
Not one.
My mother would have no objection but my father hates London.
We never had a governess. Mr Collins squirms in embarrassment. Darcy watches Elizabeth, keenly.
Not at all, Lady Catherine.
Yes, ma'am. All.
Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. But I think it would be very hard on younger sisters, not to have their share of amusement because the elder is still unmarried. And to be kept back on such a motive! It would hardly encourage sisterly affection.
 With three younger sisters grown up, your Ladyship can hardly expect me to own to
No, I beg you -
Please, I told you I play poorly -
Thank you, your ladyship.
You mean to frighten me, Mr Darcy, by coming in all your state to hear me, but I won't be alarmed even though your sister does play so well.
â€¢ You really care to know? The colonel nods.
Prepare yourself for something very dreadful.
 True, and nobody can be introduced in a ballroom.
Maybe you should take your aunt's advice and practice. Ouch! Darcy flinches. Lizzie turns away from him and carries on playing. Darcy gazes at the curve of her neck. She plays a false note, stumbles, and grimly carries on.
 Mr Darcy! An awkward pause.
Please, do be seated.
I believe so -- and she could not have bestowed her kindness on a more grateful
He is indeed lucky to have found one of the few sensible women who would have accepted him. Darcy sits down.
Shall I call for some tea?
What on earth have you done to poor Mr Darcy?
How long do you plan to stay in Kent, Colonel?
I do imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly to have someone to order around. I wonder he does not marry and secure a lasting convenience of that kind.
Really?
What happened?
 Who was the man?
Did Mr Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?
What kind of objections? Her lack of fortune?
So he separated them?
I wish Mr Darcy and all his friends well in finding partners suitable to their very high standards. Good morning, Col. Fitzwilliam. 76 Elizabeth see that Collinses are still busy with their 76 parishioners and slips away. Darcy sees her from a distance.
â€¢ Me?
I don't understand...
 Sir, I appreciate the struggle you have been through, and I am very sorry to have caused you pain. Believe me, it was unconsciously done. A silence. Gathering her shawl, she gets to her feet.
Yes, sir.
No?
 I'm sure that the feelings which, as you've told me, have hindered your regard, will help you in overcoming it.
I might as well enquire why, with so. evident a design of insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me against your better judgement. If I was uncivil, that was some excuse -
But I have other reasons, you know I have!
Do you think that anything might tempt me to accept the man who has ruined, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most beloved sister? Silence. Darcy looks as if he's been struck across the face.
Do you deny it, Mr Darcy? That you separated a young couple who loved each other, exposing your friend to the censure of the world for caprice, and my sister to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind?
 How could you do it?
â€¢ Indifferent?
That's because she's shy!
Because you suggested it!
My sister hardly shows her true feelings to me! I suppose you suspect that his fortune had some bearing on the matter?
What was?
Did my sister give that impression?
Our want of connection? Mr Bingley didn't vex himself about that!
How, sir?
And what about Mr Wickham?
What excuse can you give for your behavior to him?
He told me of his misfortunes.
You have ruined his chances, and yet treat him with sarcasm?
My pride?
And those are the words of a gentleman? From the first moment I met you, your arrogance and conceit, your selfish distain of the feelings of others, made me realize that you were the last man in the world I could ever be prevailed upon to marry. Darcy recoils, as if slapped. A terrible silence.
Elizabeth!
I was caught somewhat off-guard.
Shall I call the doctor?
No! Charlotte, I shall be quite all right. Please, give Lady de Bourgh my apologies. You must not keep her waiting. Mr Collins clatters up the stairs.
Lizzy: Are you alright?
I do not know. I hardly know myself. Elizabeth looks at Charlotte utterly shaken.
How fortunate, you are here just in time to catch everybody coming through from Longbourn.
How is Jane? Mrs Gardiner smiles sadly.
She is outside. Through a window Elizabeth sees Jane sitting quietly alone at her needle work.
I am quite over him, Lizzie. If he passed in the street I would hardly notice. London is so diverting...
oh Jane...
Its true! What with the theatre and... But tell me, what news from Kent?
Nothing. Everything as you might imagine. Elizabeth tries to smile. There is a crash as all the Bennet's arrive at the house. Kitty rushes into the garden crying her eyes out, she is followed by Lydia and Mrs Bennet.
Lizzie, tell mama, tell her!
  Â€¢ Mrs Forster has invited me.
 Why didn't she ask me as well?
Kitty, what's happened?
- because she likes me better.
I've just as much right as Lydia -
Oh, if I could but go to Brighton -
- and more so, because I'm two years older! Elizabeth looks to Jane.
Lydia has been invited to Brighton with the Foresters.
â€¢ A little sea-bathing would set me up very
I shall dine with the officers every night! An anguished wail from Kitty.
I'm sure I cried for two days when Colonel Millar's regiment went away. thought I should have broke my heart.
Please Papa, don't let her go!
If you, dear father, will not take the trouble to check her, she will be fixed forever as the silliest and most determined flirt who ever made her family ridiculous. And Kitty will follow, as she always does.
Peace! Is that all you care about?
Father, its dangerous! -
No wonder our family is treated with contempt. She leaves, tears stinging her eyes. Her father looks puzzled at her outburst.
I don't wish to be stuck with such a foolish family any longer, with your constant talk of men and marriages. Surely there is more to life.
Lizzie dear, you would be very welcome to accompany us?
Oh, the glories of nature! What are men, compared to rocks and mountains?
Believe me, men are either eaten up with arrogance or stupidity. And if they're amiable they're so easily led that they have no minds of their own whatsoever.
Take care, my love, that savours strongly of bitterness.
No, they bring nothing but heartache.
I saw Mr Darcy when I was in Rosings.
Why did you not tell me. Did he mention Mr Bingley. Pause.
No. He did not. Elizabeth has never felt more alone in the company of her sister.
Pemberley?
Well, we shall go there tomorrow, Lizzie.
I would rather stay here.
Stay here?
 I must own that I'm tired of great houses. All those carpets and curtains.
But you liked Chatsworth.
If it is anything like Mr Darcy, I am sure I will not be able to bear it.
Come, come, Lizzie.
I hear that Pemberley is not far from here.
You see something of the owner, do you, in town?
I'm so glad you changed your mind. Elizabeth is alert, her eyes bright with curiosity. The parkland is wild and rocky. Deer graze; rooks wheel in the sky. A sense of freedom and liberation. As the carriage drives over the top of a hill, close on Elizabeth's face. She gasps. The Gardiners gasp. A huge, wide shot of Pemberley House. It's vast, breathtakingly beautiful, set in great boulder-strewn park lands. A mansion built of golden stone, glowing in the sunlight.
Imagine being mistress of all this. It is as big as all Cheapside. Elizabeth is lost in admiration.
 Keep up. They walk through room after amazing room: a breath- taking library, an unbelievable staircase.
A handsome face. Lizzie, is it a true likeness of him?
Only a little.
â€¢ They are at home?!
If he should marry, you might see more of him.
What do you mean?
I thought you were in London.
No. Another ghastly silence. Then they both speak at once.
I'm visiting Derbyshire with my uncle and aunt.
Very pleasant. Tomorrow we go to Matlock.
Yes. At the Rose and Crown. Another pause. She extends her hand.
I'm so sorry to intrude. They said the house was open for visitors. I had no idea... She shakes his hand and starts to walk away.
Oh no! I'm very fond of walking.
Goodbye, Mr Darcy.
â€¢ Not at all like you painted him.
 To dine with him?
- there is something pleasing about his mouth, when he speaks.
He particularly wishes you to meet his sister.
His sister?
What a beautiful instrument.
 Your brother is well, I trust?
Yes, very.
It is so beautiful up here. I will be sorry to leave. Darcy smiles at her.
You have been a most gracious host. I'm sure my aunt and uncle will talk of nothing else for days.
It does you credit, sir.
Thank you so much Mr Darcy. Darcy is about to take his leave when a servant brings Elizabeth a letter.
 107 Its from Jane. 10 â€¢ she rips open the letter.
It is the most dreadful news. Lydia has run away - with Mr Wickham. They are gone together from Brighton to Lord knows where. She has no money, no connections, I fear she is lost forever.
No, this is my fault. I might have prevented all of it by merely being open with my sisters rather than too proud with my knowledge. Mr and Mrs Gardiner look at each other perplexed.
Has anything been done to recover her?
Father has gone to London. But I know very well that nothing can be done. We have not the smallest hope.
Sir, it think it is too late.
Why did the Foresters let her out of their sight? I always said they were unfit to have charge of her.
 And now she is ruined.
You are all ruined. Who will take you now with a fallen sister? Poor Mr Bennet will now have to fight the perfidious Wickham and then be killed...
He hasn't found him yet, Mama.
- and The Collins' will turn us out before he is cold in his grave -
Do not be alarmed, mama. Our uncle is helping in the search.
Lydia must know what this will do to my nerves, such flutterings and spasms all over me...
How long is this going to go on for?
Don't be too harsh. This is hard for all of us. They walk downstairs.
I can't bear not hearing anything.
- who is to fight Wickham and make him marry Lydia, now you've come home?
You suppose them to be still in London?
Oh father, I'm so sorry.
You mustn't be too severe on yourself.
It's to Daddy. It's in uncle's writing. Mr Bennet snatches the letter.
Are they married?

Are they married?
They will be, if father will settle a hundred pounds a year on her. That is Wickham's condition.
A hundred pounds!
You will agree to this, father? The letter is passed around the other girls.
What do you mean, Father?
Ah, I see.
See what?
Do you think it a large sum?
Ten thousand! Heaven forbid!
Lydia married! And at sixteen too! Ring the bell, Kitty! I must put on my things and tell Lady Lucas! Oh to see her face! And tell the servants they will have a bowl of punch! The other Bennet's are assembled.
We should thank our uncle, Mama.
And so he should help! He's much richer than us, and he hasn't got any children.
 How can you talk like that? Her mother gets to her feet.
A daughter, married!
Is that all you think about?
"Mrs Wickham" - how well it sounds
 You don't know what he's like
Now where will they live? Purvis Lodge might do. Ashworth is vacant of course, but it's too far off, I couldn't bear to have her ten miles from me -
- and then we passed Sarah Sims in her carriage so I took off my glove and let my hand just rest on the window frame, so she might see the ring, and then 1 bowed and smiled like anything! Kitty shrieks with envy. Lizzie moves away; she cannot bear it. Wickham catches her eye, but she ignores him.
Jane, I take your place now, and you must go lower, for I am the married woman. She sits down and giggles at her sisters. The maid brings â€¢ in the food. Lydia holds up her hand, to display her ring to the maid.
You must all go to Brighton, for that is the place to get husbands! I hope you have half my good luck.
 Lydia!
â€¢ Can I come and stay with you?
Well, Monday morning came and I was in such a fuss -
I don't want to hear -
- there was my aunt, preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon, she was horrid unpleasant -
Can't you understand why?
- but I didn't hear a word because I was thinking of my dear Wickham. I longed to â€¢ know whether he would be married in his blue coat...
The north of England, I believe, boasts some spectacular scenery...
- and then my uncle was called away from the church on business and I thought - who is to be our best man if he doesn't come back? Lucky he did come back or I would have had to ask Mr Darcy -
 Mr Darcy?
I forgot! I shouldn't have said a word!
 He was the one that discovered us! He knew where to find Wickham, you see.
Come on, Wickham! You've got to play.
Yes, come on! Wickham looks slightly abashed - a trapped man. What has he let himself in for? Lizzie comes into the garden, looking for her younger sister. Wickham detaches himself and comes over to her. A rueful smile.
 I met Mr Darcy's sister.
Very much. We found a great deal to talk about.
 Why was Mr Darcy there?
I'm not supposed to tell. Lizzie abandons her pride. She takes Lydia's hand.
Please, Lydia!
Because he paid for it.
 For what?
 The wedding, Wickham's commission. Everything.
Everything?
 Lydia! It's your turn! Lydia moves to go.
People kept saying Wickham owed them money, it was so tedious. So Darcy settled his debts but I don't really like him, do you? Lizzie pulls her back.
But why did he do it?
 I don't know, do I? Anyway you're not to tell because it's supposed to be our uncle who paid, and he wouldn't have â€¢ minded paying, either, because I'm his favorite.
Write to me often, my dear'. Wickham takes his leave of Elizabeth.
Married women never have much time for writing. My sisters may write to me! They'll have nothing else to do. The Mrs Bennet and the girls watch as the carriage drives away.
 Â€¢ Oh there is nothing so bad as parting with ones children! One seems so forlorn without them.
That is the consequence of marrying a daughter. It must make you better satisfied that your other four are single.
Mr Bingley? Mrs Hill indicates a woman in the butcher's shop.
Tomorrow?
Huh! Come along, girls. Their mother goes into the draper's shop. Jane pauses at the threshold.
 Â€¢ It's all right, Lizzie. I'm just glad that he comes alone, because then we shall see less of him.
He is here! He is here, he's at the door!
Oh my goodness! Everybody act naturally. Jane completely freezes. Everybody else goes into a fluster.
Look. There's someone with him. Mr whats his name. The pompous one from before. Elizabeth looks through the window at Darcy, her heart leaps to her mouth.
Mr Darcy indeed! The very insolence of 0 0 it. What does he think of coming here? Elizabeth returns to her seat and sits down, heavily. Mrs Bennet hurries over to Jane and pinches her cheeks.

- but it's very hard to have my Lydia taken away from me. Mr Wickham has been transferred to Newcastle, where ever that is. Thank heaven he has some friends. Mrs Bennet shoots a frosty glance at Mr Darcy. This is more than Elizabeth can bare.
Do you hope to stay long in the country, Mr Bingley?
When you have killed all your own birds, Mr Bingley, I beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please.
- Mr Bennet will be vastly happy to oblige you, and will save all the best of â€¢ the covies for you.
Are you well, Mr Darcy?
Well, I hope the weather stays fine, for your sport.
 So soon?
My Jane looks well, does she not? Mr-Bingley stands up abruptly.
You must come again. For when you were in town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us. I have not forgot you see. At least three courses. Bingley and Darcy take their leave, leaving the Bennets sitting in silence all looking at once another. Kitty is fit to burst out laughing, Elizabeth and Jane horrified by the awkward visit.
Well, I'm glad that's over. We can now meet as indifferent acquaintances.
 Oh yes? Jane, take care.
You cannot think me so weak as to be in
I think you are in great danger of making him as much in love with you as ever.
I'm sorry, though, that he came with Mr Darcy.
 Oh Jane, I have acted so stupidly. Had I been in love, I could not have been more blind!
 What do you mean? The door bell rings.
It is him. He's back. He's come again. â€¢ A stunned reaction.
Girls. Everybody to the kitchen. Immediately. Oh, Mr Bingley. It is so good to see you again so soon. She ushers everyone out, not before squeezing Jane's hand. Now Jane and Bingley are alone, facing each other with extreme embarrassment.
Ssssshhh! Elizabeth is apart from her family. She cannot bear to be there. She walks down the corridor and out of the house into the garden. Through a window she sees Bingley on one knee, her eyes fill with tears as she walks away from the house.
â€¢ Yes. A hundred times - yes. Mrs Bennet and the girls throw open the double doors to the drawing room and come crashing in. Bingley and Jane beam at them.
Thank the Lord for that. I thought it would never happen.
Exceed their income? He has five thousand a year! I knew she could not be so beautiful for nothing. The camera moves through to another bedroom - where Mary is reading a book out loud to Kitty - then to yet another
He has made me so happy. You know, he. was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring!
How did he account for it?
He thought me indifferent!
Unfathomable.
No doubt poisoned by his pernicious sister.
Bravo! That is the most unforgiving speech you've ever made.
Oh Lizzie, if I could but see you so happy. If there were such another man for you! There is a noise outside.
Perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr Collins in time. What is that? More noise, it sounds like a carriage, then a loud banging on the door downstairs. The girls look at each other.
Maybe he's changed his mind. Timidly, Mr Bennet opens the door revealing a wide-eyed Lady Catherine de Bourgh. Everyone gasps.
Lady Catherine! Lady Catherine does not acknowledge her, but comes in uninvited, inspecting the assembled company of aghast Bennets.
All but one, the youngest has been lately married your ladyship. And my eldest was only proposed to yesterday afternoon.
â€¢ I am sure it is nothing compared to Rosings, but it is larger than Sir William Lucas's, I can assure you.
Indeed you are mistaken. I can not account for this honour at all.
If you believed it impossible, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
 Your coming here will be rather a confirmation, surely, if indeed such a report exists.
I have never heard of it.
I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship. You may ask the questions, which I may not choose to answer.
Your Ladyship declared it to be impossible.
Only this - if that is the case you can have no reason to suppose he will make an offer to me.
I am not.
I will not. And I certainly never shall. Allow me to say, the arguments which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have, insulted me in every possible method and can now have nothing further to say. I must ask you to leave immediately. Good night. Elizabeth throws open.the door, revealing the family outside.
Just a small misunderstanding. She walks past them to bed.
Lizzie!
For once in your life. Just leave me alone. Everyone looks aghast at Elizabeth's reaction.
Mr Darcy!
I could not sleep.
Mr Darcy, I must thank you for your unexampled generosity to both my sisters. I know what kindnesses you have done for poor Lydia and suspect your hand in the happy resolution for Jane also.
I am very happy to inform you that not only have my sentiments changed there are no other words which could give me greater pleasure. Darcy stares at her. They both start to cry. Darcy very, very slowly and gently touches her face. She closes her eyes. They kiss. She touches his face with her hand, the kiss becomes passionate.
Lizzie, where have you been. We thought something had happened to you. Darcy follows Elizabeth in.
Mr Darcy has come to speak with Papa. Everyone is stunned.
No, Papa.
 Have you no other objection than your belief in my indifference?
I do like him!
No, you mustn't tell anyone! He wouldn't want it.
â€¢ Very much. He looks at her earnestly, searching her face. He loves his daughter very deeply. What he sees leaves him in no doubt.
Oh thank you! She starts to rush out.
How did it begin?
Now be sincere, did you admire me for my impertinenc?
You may as well call it impertinence, though make a virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your protection, and you are to exaggerate - them as much as possible. And, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as maybe... and I shall begin directly... We draw back-their figures diminish, smaller and smaller under the immense, star-spangled sky. . .Fainter and fainter, the sound of music and laughter...
